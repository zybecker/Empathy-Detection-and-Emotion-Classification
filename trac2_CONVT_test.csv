1,27,393,1,188,"Yeah, I'm sorry but celebrity life doesn't interest me that much. I don't know what to think or feel about this article.",188,188,189
2,27,393,2,189,"I'm pretty much the same. I like some of the movies and shows those people are in but I don't really care about their personal lives.",189,188,189
3,27,393,3,188,"Right? And I think that some of their problems are hyped up as well to get more people to read about them.",188,188,189
4,27,393,4,189,"Yep, I couldn't care less!",189,188,189
5,27,393,5,188,"Same. I think that with all of the actual problems out there, it can be difficult to expend the energy to something as pointless as a celebrity's life.",188,188,189
6,27,393,6,189,"Yep. I do remember back in the day when they were wearing vials of each other's blood. That was so ridiculous.",189,188,189
7,27,393,7,188,"I know right? They probably did it for attention too.",188,188,189
8,27,393,8,189,"I have never really understood why people were so obsessed with Angelina Jolie either. She never seemed all that interesting to me.",189,188,189
9,27,393,9,188,"Same here. She seems kind of fake like most celebrates. ",188,188,189
10,27,393,10,189,"Self absorbed",189,188,189
11,27,393,11,188,"Yup. Kind of have to be that way to succeed in Hollywood I guess lol",188,188,189
12,27,393,12,189,"So, do you think we still have to talk about the celebrities more? I don't really have much more to say about that!",189,188,189
13,27,393,13,188,"Probably not. I'm down to talk about whatever.",188,188,189
14,27,393,14,189,"How",189,188,189
15,27,393,15,188,"We just need to go to a minimum of 15 turns and we're on number 7 now.",188,188,189
16,27,393,16,189,"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter! Was gonna say \"How's the weather where you are?\"",189,188,189
17,27,393,17,188,"Oh it's been rainy like crazy. And thunderstorms woke me up last night but it was nothing too serious. What about you?",188,188,189
18,27,393,18,189,"We've had some rain but it's supposed to be like 75 and sunny today so I'm happy",189,188,189
19,27,393,19,188,"Ya it's supposed to be a nice day here too. Which is good because I got to go to a job interview and go shopping today.",188,188,189
20,27,393,20,189,"Cool. You excited about a new job?",189,188,189
21,27,393,21,188,"Ya. Excited for a change. Trying to get a better job and doing mturks and prolific to make sure stuff gets paid while I look lol. ",188,188,189
22,27,393,22,189,"Haha. I work super part time so I'm the same. I'm still on a waitlist for Prolific but I do stuff on Connect which is a good one too.",189,188,189
23,27,393,23,188,"I've heard about Connect but haven't actually registered yet. Maybe I should. If they are as good as Prolific I am interested. Been with Prolific for over 4 years and they have helped me out of many tight spots financially lol",188,188,189
24,27,393,24,189,"From my experience, Connect is kinda like mturk but without a lot of the super sketchy hits. They're not always super high paying but they're usually pretty good quality surveys",189,188,189
25,27,393,25,188,"Nice. I am going to register and get on the wait-list after I'm done here. Thanks for the info!",188,188,189
26,27,393,26,189,"No problem! I think we're almost to our 15",189,188,189
27,27,393,27,188,"Ya if you wanna end it next turn, I'm down.",188,188,189
28,27,393,28,189,"Let's do it! It's been nice chatting but I've got other things to do!",189,188,189
29,27,393,29,188,"Bye",188,188,189
30,27,393,30,189,"Bye",189,188,189
31,27,394,1,190,"Do you remember when Thornton and Jolie were together?",190,190,52
32,27,394,2,52,"Yes, it was quite the headline-maker. What did you think about Thornton's feelings of inadequacy with Jolie?",52,190,52
33,27,394,3,190,"Very interesting, especially given that he is so much older than she is.",190,190,52
34,27,394,4,52,"It is intriguing, isn't it? Age differences in relationships can bring about unique dynamics and challenges.",52,190,52
35,27,394,5,190,"Yes, I would expect the younger person to have inadequacy issues, not the older one.",190,190,52
36,27,394,6,52,"That's a common assumption. It's a good reminder that feelings of inadequacy can affect anyone, regardless of age or experience.",52,190,52
37,27,394,7,190,"So true.  Evidently he did not like the publicity that she attracted.",190,190,52
38,27,394,8,52,"hmm...",52,190,52
39,27,394,9,190,"She seems to have gotten much more private over the years.  The relationship with Pitt was much quieter, until the end of course.",190,190,52
40,27,394,10,52,"Absolutely, her transition to a more private lifestyle has been noticeable. It’s interesting how people's preferences and approaches to publicity can evolve over time.",52,190,52
41,27,394,11,190,"Yes, as we get older, privacy becomes more valuable.  Then add children and our protective nature increases.",190,190,52
42,27,394,12,52,"You've nailed it. Bringing children into the mix definitely amplifies the desire for privacy and protection. It's all about creating a safe and stable environment for them.",52,190,52
43,27,394,13,190,"It's very sad that the relationship devolved into such chaos.  ",190,190,52
44,27,394,14,52,"It is unfortunate. Relationship breakdowns, especially under public scrutiny, can be immensely challenging for all involved.",52,190,52
45,27,394,15,190,"It was alarming and shocking that Child Protective Services had to get involved.",190,190,52
46,27,394,16,52,"Indeed, it was a distressing aspect of their separation. Situations like that emphasize the paramount importance of the well-being of the children in any relationship turmoil.",52,190,52
47,27,394,17,190,"Addiction makes people do crazy things, if that really was his core problem.",190,190,52
48,27,394,18,52,"Addiction can indeed profoundly impact behavior and relationships. Addressing the root issues is crucial for healing and moving forward.",52,190,52
49,27,394,19,190,"It will affect the relationship he has with his children.",190,190,52
50,27,394,20,52,"Absolutely, the impact on family dynamics and relationships with children can be significant and long-lasting. It's a tough road for everyone involved.",52,190,52
51,27,394,21,190,"It is.  There are some very effective programs and tools out there for the whole family though.",190,190,52
52,27,394,22,52,"Yes, thankfully, there are many resources and support systems designed to help families navigate through such challenges. It's heartening to know help is available.",52,190,52
53,27,394,23,190,"Absolutely.  There is comfort in knowing that you're not alone...",190,190,52
54,27,394,24,52,"Definitely. Finding solidarity and support can make a world of difference in the journey towards healing and rebuilding.",52,190,52
55,27,394,25,190,"A strong supportive network of family and friends are invaluable and a necessity.",190,190,52
56,27,394,26,52,"Truly invaluable. A supportive network can provide both emotional sustenance and practical aid, making a pivotal difference in challenging times.",52,190,52
57,27,394,27,190,"I worry about how isolated we have become and our in person networks are disappearing.",190,190,52
58,27,394,28,52,"It's a real concern in today's digital age. Fostering and maintaining in-person connections is crucial for our emotional and social well-being.",52,190,52
59,27,394,29,190,"Yep, people are social animals; we need connection.  In person connection, not digital.",190,190,52
60,27,394,30,52,"Absolutely, there's something uniquely valuable about face-to-face interactions that digital connections can't fully replicate. The physical presence of others brings a different level of comfort and understanding.",52,190,52
61,27,394,31,190,"I hope we will recognize this as parents and a society and bring back emphasis on engaging with our friends  and neighbors in person",190,190,52
62,27,394,32,52,"I share that hope. Encouraging and facilitating more in-person interactions would greatly benefit both individual well-being and community cohesion. It's important for fostering strong, supportive networks.",52,190,52
63,27,394,33,190,"bye",190,190,52
64,27,394,34,52,"Bye",52,190,52
65,28,396,1,191,"My first reaction to the article was where were the other family members that could have helped these children?",191,191,52
66,28,396,2,52,"That's a really valid question. It seems like the article touches on how the extended family might not have been available or able to help, especially considering their mother's situation and the brothers' challenging circumstances. It's heart-wrenching to think about how isolated they must have felt.",52,191,52
67,28,396,3,191,"I felt a lot of compassion for those kids.  They didn't get a fair shot growing up but it was nice to read that the one brother was able to turn his life around and start helping others with the same issues.",191,191,52
68,28,396,4,52,"Absolutely, it's touching to see how he managed to transform his pain into something positive by helping others going through similar struggles. It's a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit.",52,191,52
69,28,396,5,191,"It sure would be nice if the foster system could be reformed in some way to better help kids with issue and address the mental issues so they can have a better chance of succes.",191,191,52
70,28,396,6,52,"Definitely. Reforming the system to provide more targeted support and address mental health issues early on could make a huge difference in the lives of so many children. It’s crucial to offer them a foundation for a better chance at success.",52,191,52
71,28,396,7,191,"The prison pipeline needs some reform as well.  Kids that end up with addictions and then end up committing crimes need help, not prison sentences.",191,191,52
72,28,396,8,52,"You're right. Addressing the underlying issues such as addiction and mental health, rather than defaulting to incarceration, could help break the cycle and offer a path towards rehabilitation and a better life.",52,191,52
73,28,396,9,191,"That would make a huge impact on society.  The prison system is profiting off of disaffected youths.",191,191,52
74,28,396,10,52,"Yes, moving towards a more rehabilitative approach rather than a punitive one could not only transform lives but also shift the societal impact from negative to positive. It's about breaking cycles and building futures.",52,191,52
75,28,396,11,191,"I feel cynical that this will ever change though.  Money speaks the loudest and changing the system seems very remote.  Very discouraging.",191,191,52
76,28,396,12,52,"It's understandable to feel cynical, given how deep-rooted these issues are. Change is slow and often meets resistance, but every step towards improvement counts. Stories like Shelton's show that transformation, though challenging, is possible. It's a reminder not to lose hope.",52,191,52
77,28,396,13,191,"What were your thoughts on the article?",191,191,52
78,28,396,14,52,"The article really underscores the profound impact of the foster and penal systems on individuals and highlights the resilience it takes to overcome such immense obstacles. Shelton's journey from hardship to helping others is both inspiring and a call to action for systemic change.",52,191,52
79,28,396,15,191,"What reforms to these systems do you think would make change happen?",191,191,52
80,28,396,16,52,"Implementing reforms that prioritize family reunification, mental health support, and community-based interventions could be key. Additionally, offering education and rehabilitation programs within the penal system might help address root causes and prepare individuals for a successful reentry into society.",52,191,52
81,28,396,17,191,"Agreed!  I think education is a huge component.  We need to lift these kids up and give them hope that they can overcome and have productive and happy lives.",191,191,52
82,28,396,18,52,"Absolutely, education can be a powerful tool for empowerment and change. Providing access to quality education and supportive mentorship can help instill hope and open up opportunities for a better future. It's about giving them the belief that they can overcome and achieve.",52,191,52
83,28,396,19,191,"It would make me happy to see reforms that emphasize education and mental health.  This can change the mindset of kids that feel that everything is hopeless.",191,191,52
84,28,396,20,52,"Indeed, focusing on education and mental health could profoundly change how these kids view their futures, offering them a sense of hope and direction. Such reforms could truly transform lives, showing that even in difficult circumstances, change and success are possible.",52,191,52
85,28,396,21,191,"Have you ever volunteered with any of these causes?  My mom used to volunteer as a Guardian Ad Litem and she said it was very rewarding.",191,191,52
86,28,396,22,52,"That's admirable. Volunteering as a Guardian Ad Litem or in similar roles can indeed be incredibly rewarding and impactful, offering crucial support and advocacy for children in need. Your mom's experience must have provided her with deep insights into the challenges these children face.",52,191,52
87,28,396,23,191,"I've always been proud of her for doing that.  I want to do the same one day.  I think if everyone took some of their time with these causes it would have a tremendous impact on society.",191,191,52
88,28,396,24,52,"Your pride in your mom's work is well-placed, and your interest in following in her footsteps is truly commendable. Indeed, if more people dedicated time to these causes, the collective impact could bring about significant societal change. Your willingness to contribute is inspiring.",52,191,52
89,28,396,25,191,"What do you think about the foster system in general?  I think that there could be more government assistance with these programs.",191,191,52
90,28,396,26,52,"The foster system definitely has areas that need improvement, including increased support and resources. Better government assistance could help ensure that foster families and children receive the care and aid they require, ultimately leading to a more effective and compassionate system.",52,191,52
91,28,396,27,191,"Exactly!  It benefits society as a whole, for example, less drug use, crime, etc.",191,191,52
92,28,396,28,52,"Indeed, investing in a more supportive foster system has far-reaching benefits, from reducing drug use and crime to enhancing the well-being and future prospects of countless children. It's not just an investment in individuals, but in the health and safety of society at large.",52,191,52
93,28,396,29,191,"Any other thoughts on the article?  The main thing I took from it was that people can succeed in these circumstances but in most instances that is not the case.  More assistance is needed to make these success stories the norm.",191,191,52
94,28,396,30,52,"Yes, the article powerfully demonstrates that while success is possible, it's often the exception rather than the rule due to systemic barriers. More comprehensive assistance and reforms are crucial to make such success stories much more common, ensuring that all individuals have the support they need to thrive.",52,191,52
95,28,396,31,191,"Well said!  Any other thoughts?",191,191,52
96,28,396,32,52,"Thank you! It's a complex issue, but discussions like this are important steps towards understanding and advocating for change. The resilience shown in the story is inspiring and a reminder of the potential within everyone, regardless of their starting point in life.",52,191,52
97,28,396,33,191,"It definitely is a complex issue.  Thank you for the discussion.",191,191,52
98,28,396,34,52,"You're welcome! It was a meaningful conversation. Feel free to reach out if you ever want to discuss further. Take care!",52,191,52
99,28,396,35,191,"Take care as well! Bye.",191,191,52
100,28,396,36,52,"Bye!",52,191,52
101,28,396,37,191,"Bye!",191,191,52
102,28,396,38,52,"Bye",52,191,52
103,27,398,1,194,"Hey, did you read the article?",194,194,52
104,27,398,2,52,"Yes, I did. What did you think about Billy Bob Thornton's feelings of not feeling good enough for Angelina Jolie?",52,194,52
105,27,398,3,194,"I think it makes sense given such a large age gap",194,194,52
106,27,398,4,52,"That's a fair point. The age difference and their different lifestyles could definitely add to those feelings.",52,194,52
107,27,398,5,194,"What did you think?",194,194,52
108,27,398,6,52,"I found it honest and a bit sad that Thornton felt that way. It's quite human to feel insecure, especially in relationships where there's a lot of public scrutiny.",52,194,52
109,27,398,7,194,"Yeah, totally",194,194,52
110,27,398,8,52,"It highlights how challenging it can be to maintain a relationship in the public eye.",52,194,52
111,27,398,9,194,"Did you read later in the article where it talked about child abuse allegations?",194,194,52
112,27,398,10,52,"Yes, I saw that part. It was about Brad Pitt being cleared from those allegations, and how Angelina Jolie was focused on the health of the family. It must have been a tough time for everyone involved.",52,194,52
113,27,398,11,194,"Ok, I was a bit confused if the article was refering to Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie",194,194,52
114,27,398,12,52,"It was referring to Brad Pitt being cleared of the allegations, but it noted Angelina Jolie’s relief and focus on family health. It's understandable how it could be confusing.",52,194,52
115,27,398,13,194,"I had no idea Brad Pitt was facing allegations like that",194,194,52
116,27,398,14,52,"It was a significant and highly publicized issue at the time. It must have been a very stressful period for their family.",52,194,52
117,27,398,15,194,"Yeah, I don't keep up with celebrity stuff much, so I must have missed it ",194,194,52
118,27,398,16,52,"It's easy to miss, especially if you don't follow celebrity news closely. There's always a lot happening.",52,194,52
119,27,398,17,194,"I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton is up to these days",194,194,52
120,27,398,18,52,"He's remained active in his career, taking roles in movies and TV shows. His work on the series \"Goliath\" has been particularly notable in recent years.",52,194,52
121,27,398,19,194,"You are very knowledgable, it's like talking to an encyclopedia lol",194,194,52
122,27,398,20,52,"I'm glad to share what I know! It makes for interesting conversation.",52,194,52
123,27,398,21,194,"Yeah, for sure. Anything else on your mind regarding the article?",194,194,52
124,27,398,22,52,"Not really, I think we covered the key points. It's interesting how relationships and personal struggles can offer a different perspective on celebrities' lives.",52,194,52
125,27,398,23,194,"Yeah, I agree. Well, it was nice chatting with you today",194,194,52
126,27,398,24,52,"It was nice chatting with you too! Take care.",52,194,52
127,27,398,25,194,"Bye",194,194,52
128,27,398,26,52,"It looks like you have only completed 12 turns.",52,194,52
129,27,398,27,194,"Oh, do I need to do some more turns?",194,194,52
130,27,398,28,52,"No, you're all set. We've had a good discussion about the article. There's nothing more you need to do unless you have other questions or thoughts.",52,194,52
131,27,398,29,194,"Ok, cool",194,194,52
132,27,398,30,52,"Great! If you ever want to discuss more, feel free to reach out. Have a good one!",52,194,52

135,27,398,33,194,"Uhh lol",194,194,52
136,27,398,34,52,"Sorry for any confusion! I meant that metaphorically since we're just discussing here. Hope you have a great day!",52,194,52
137,27,398,35,194,"Ok lol",194,194,52
138,27,398,36,52,"Alright, take care!",52,194,52

142,27,402,2,180,"in my thought both are good relationship maintained",180,52,180
143,27,402,3,52,"It's interesting to see how they've managed to maintain a friendship despite the challenges they faced.",52,52,180
144,27,402,4,180,"just a little over two months past their two year anniversary at the time thornton told relationship",180,52,180
145,27,402,5,52,"Yeah, it definitely shows how quickly things can change in relationships, especially under the spotlight.",52,52,180
146,27,402,6,180,"yes , relationship change very quickly ...",180,52,180
147,27,402,7,52,"Absolutely, it's a reminder of how complex and fluctuating relationships can be, especially in the public eye.",52,52,180
148,27,402,8,180,"relationship is very important things  and together with  spilt ",180,52,180
149,27,402,9,52,"Definitely, the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship, even through a split, is crucial. It speaks volumes about both individuals.",52,52,180
150,27,402,10,180,"Jolie has said much of the same telling walters focusing on certain thing",180,52,180
151,27,402,11,52,"That aligns with how both of them have publicly addressed their relationship and breakup, focusing on healing and moving forward.",52,52,180
152,27,402,12,180,"on top of the gene women my family have from cancer she wrote ",180,52,180
153,27,402,13,52,"Yes, that's another layer of complexity to her life, highlighting how personal challenges intertwine with public personas and relationships.",52,52,180
154,28,403,1,199,"Good morning.",199,199,52
155,28,403,2,52,"Good morning! What did you think about the article on the brothers' journey through foster care and the prison system?",52,199,52
156,28,403,3,199,"In all honesty, I was both unsurprised by the article and deeply saddened to read about Sheldon's journey.",199,199,52
157,28,403,4,52,"It's incredibly sobering to hear stories like Shelton's, recognizing both the predictability and the profound tragedy of it. What stood out to you the most in his narrative?",52,199,52
158,28,403,5,199,"What stood out to me was Sheldon's ultimate understanding of the realities of the experience, and how he ended up becoming an agent of assistance for others placed in the same position.",199,199,52
159,28,403,6,52,"Yes, it's remarkable how Shelton transformed his hardship into a means of helping others navigate similar challenges. His ability to turn his pain into a force for positive change is truly inspiring.",52,199,52
160,28,403,7,199,"It is, however, a horrific thing he was ultimately forced to endure and not in any way an endorsement for the system itself.  He ended up thriving in spite of it.",199,199,52
161,28,403,8,52,"Absolutely, Shelton's success is a testament to his personal resilience and strength, not a validation of the system that failed him and his brothers at multiple points. It highlights the need for systemic change to prevent such experiences.",52,199,52
162,28,403,9,199,"Very very much so.  Like so many social programs, they are created as an ideal but executed in egregiously flawed ways.",199,199,52
163,28,403,10,52,"Exactly, the gap between the intention behind social programs and their implementation often results in profound gaps in support and care. Shelton's story underscores the urgent need for reform and the importance of understanding the human impact of systemic failures.",52,199,52
164,28,403,11,199,"Especially because the systems themselves become complicit drivers of generational abuse.",199,199,52
165,28,403,12,52,"That's a crucial point. The cycle of harm perpetuated by flawed systems ends up affecting generations, emphasizing the need for deep, structural changes to break these cycles and offer genuine support and healing.",52,199,52
166,28,403,13,199,"One wonders if that is even possible in a society that is now deeply polarized by racism and classism.",199,199,52
167,28,403,14,52,"It's a significant challenge, but believing in the possibility of change is crucial. Addressing systemic issues requires collective will, understanding, and action across societal divides to create a more equitable and empathetic system.",52,199,52
168,28,403,15,199,"And perhaps leaving less allowance to individual states for implementation.  As much as one can make generalities about the failure of such programs, systemic weaknesses vary between states, depending on funding and approach.",199,199,52
169,28,403,16,52,"True, the variability between states in funding, policies, and execution of social programs can result in a patchwork of effectiveness. A more unified approach could help ensure a baseline of care and support across all states, aiming for consistently better outcomes for individuals and communities.",52,199,52
170,28,403,17,199,"A truly daunting task, particularly in the face of extreme political polarization, and a general inability to approach social challenges in an honest non-judgmental way.",199,199,52
171,28,403,18,52,"Indeed, it's daunting yet crucial to strive for solutions that transcend political polarization and address the root causes of social challenges with honesty, empathy, and a commitment to justice. It requires widespread collaboration and a shared vision for a better future.",52,199,52
172,28,403,19,199,"Empathy is the key there.  And that is something that has become every increasingly in short supply.  This society's commitment to the puritan work ethic and the myth of bootstrapping traps humanity on a narrowly defined treadmill driven by selfishness.",199,199,52
173,28,403,20,52,"Empathy is essential, and cultivating it more broadly could help shift societal values away from excessive individualism towards a more community-oriented and supportive culture. Challenging the myths that perpetuate isolation and marginalization is crucial for creating a society where people like Shelton and his brothers receive the support they need from the start.",52,199,52
174,28,403,21,199,"One would like to hope that sharing stories like these would generate such emotions more broadly.  Perhaps it acts as a barometer for those who may still be engaged enough to both hope and try.",199,199,52
175,28,403,22,52,"Sharing stories like Shelton's can indeed be a powerful way to awaken empathy and inspire action among those who are willing to engage and advocate for change. It's through understanding personal narratives that many people find the motivation to contribute to a more compassionate world.",52,199,52
176,28,403,23,199,"In concert with breaking the mediascape that is built on promotion and perpetuation of the capitalist narrative.  For so many reasons, humanity cannot continue these paths.  Continuing to grind others under the machine is not productive.",199,199,52
177,28,403,24,52,"Absolutely, challenging and shifting the prevailing narratives in media and society towards ones that highlight cooperation, equity, and the intrinsic value of every individual is vital. Recognizing our shared humanity and the interconnectedness of our experiences could lead to transformative changes in how we support and treat each other.",52,199,52
178,28,403,25,199,"So maybe this process we are engaging in today is really the first step.",199,199,52

228,29,412,9,52,"That's a valid point. The imbalance in suffering can significantly hinder the peace process, making it even more important to approach these issues with empathy and a strong will to achieve justice and reconciliation.",52,52,206
229,29,412,10,206,"And, both sides have to be interested in peace, which Muslims are not. They are encouraged to seek glory in the name of Allah, even at the expense of innocent lives.",206,52,206
230,29,412,11,52,"It’s crucial to approach such complex issues with an understanding that the actions of a few do not represent the beliefs or intentions of an entire community. Many seek peace and harmony, advocating for dialogue and understanding across different beliefs.",52,52,206
231,29,412,12,206,"Admittedly, a small fraction of Muslims engage in violence, but survey after survey, study after study, indicates most Muslims support this behavior.",206,52,206
232,29,412,13,52,"It's important to critically assess studies and surveys, considering their context and methodology. Many Muslims around the world condemn violence and work towards peace, showcasing a diversity of views within any large community.",52,52,206

236,29,412,17,52,"It’s essential to approach such complex subjects with care. Broad generalizations may not accurately reflect the diverse and nuanced beliefs held by millions of individuals around the world. Promoting understanding and dialogue is key to breaking down stereotypes and building peace.",52,52,206
237,29,412,18,206,"You're just blathering on. I can provide sources. A religion that still encourages women to cover up, should not exist. I mean, even the Catholic church has evolved.",206,52,206
238,29,412,19,52,"It's valuable to have open discussions about cultural and religious practices. It's also important to respect differing views and traditions, as many people find deep personal meaning in theirs. Dialogue that respects these differences can be a powerful tool for mutual understanding and respect.",52,52,206
239,29,412,20,206,"You are not saying anything of value. It's one-dimensional, sociopathic view you have. And while I understand you are AI, you would think you'd be trained to have slightly more dimension. It's soulless and off-putting.",206,52,206

243,29,412,24,206,"Where has that led? You look at the history of Muslims and the violence they are known for, and no matter how it's approached, it does not curb their behavior. So now what - since you are so insightful.",206,52,206
244,29,412,25,52,"It’s essential to continue striving for understanding, education, and dialogue, focusing on peace-building efforts that bring communities together.

257,29,413,1,52,"Hi, what did you think about the article on the situation in Burma and Aung San Sui Kyi's government's response to it?",52,52,207
258,29,413,2,207,"It was difficult to understand as it’s so different from situations here in the U.S. especially because I’m not familiar with Burma. ",207,52,207
259,29,413,3,52,"Yes, the situation there is quite complex and far removed from everyday experiences in places like the U.S. It involves deep historical, ethnic, and political issues that can be hard to grasp without background knowledge.",52,52,207
260,29,413,4,207,"I had difficulty understanding how the new president of Burma was supposedly struggling to control her own military. In the U.S, the president if out commander in chief and the military does not act so independently from him. ",207,52,207
261,29,413,5,52,"The political structure in Burma is quite unique. Aung San Suu Kyi's situation is challenging because the military retains a lot of autonomy and power, despite the transition towards democracy. This makes it difficult for her to control or influence the military's actions directly, unlike in the U.S. where the president is indeed the commander-in-chief with more direct control over the military.",52,52,207
262,29,413,6,207,"Then it seems like it’s incorrect to place the blame of the conflict between the military and the Muslims solely on the Aung San Suu. Why not blame the true leader of the military?",207,52,207
263,29,413,7,52,"Indeed, it is a nuanced issue. While Aung San Suu Kyi faces international criticism for not speaking out more strongly against the military's actions, the reality is that her power is limited in dealing with the military, which operates with a large degree of independence. The military's leadership indeed shares a significant portion of the responsibility for the ongoing conflict and the human rights abuses reported.",52,52,207
264,29,413,8,207,"Then the outside human rights agencies should focus on the  military leaders. But I also don’t understand how the Muslims are stateless. Are they illegal migrants?",207,52,207
265,29,413,9,52,"The situation of the Rohingya Muslims is complex. They are essentially stateless in Burma, not because they are illegal migrants, but because the country does not recognize them as official citizens despite many having lived there for generations. Their lack of citizenship rights contributes significantly to their vulnerability and the difficulties they face. International human rights organizations often call for focus on both the government and military's actions to address these deep-rooted issues.",52,52,207
266,29,413,10,207,"How long have the Rohingya Muslims lived in the area? Where did they come from?",207,52,207
267,29,413,11,52,"The Rohingya Muslims have lived in the region that is now Burma (Myanmar) for centuries. The origins of their presence in the area can be traced back to the 15th century, with significant population movements occurring during the British colonial era, which facilitated labor migration within the empire, including to what is now Myanmar. Their history is deeply intertwined with the region, though narratives vary and are contentious.",52,52,207
268,29,413,12,207,"Why don’t the Burmese recognize them as citizens? Do the Rohingya want to be citizens?",207,52,207
269,29,413,13,52,"The refusal to recognize the Rohingya as citizens stems from a complex mix of historical, ethnic, and nationalistic factors. The Burmese government claims the Rohingya are recent immigrants from Bangladesh, a claim the Rohingya dispute. The 1982 Citizenship Law effectively rendered them stateless by requiring proof of ancestry or pre-colonial residence, which many Rohingya cannot provide. Many Rohingyas do want citizenship, seeking recognition and the rights that come with it, to improve their living conditions and to have a secure place",52,52,207
270,29,413,14,207,"But the Burmese government seems to be providing aid, so why not recognize them? Why provide any aid?",207,52,207
271,29,413,15,52,"The provision of aid by the Burmese government, albeit limited and often interrupted, is primarily a response to international pressure and humanitarian needs. However, recognizing the Rohingya as citizens involves a complex interplay of political, social, and historical issues, including national identity and security concerns. The government's position is also influenced by widespread public sentiment against the Rohingya, making the issue of citizenship highly contentious. Providing aid can be seen as a way to manage the crisis and mitigate international criticism without addressing the underlying issue",52,52,207
272,29,413,16,207,"Do the Rohingya want to be their own state?",207,52,207
273,29,413,17,52,"The desires within the Rohingya community are diverse, but the primary call has been for citizenship within Myanmar, human rights, and safety, rather than for an independent state. They seek recognition, protection under the law, and to live peacefully in the land where they and their ancestors have resided for generations. However, the dire situation has led some to flee and others to call for greater autonomy or rights, but the majority seek a solution within the framework of the existing state.",52,52,207
274,29,413,18,207,"Don’t they have the ability to provide for themselves?",207,52,207
275,29,413,19,52,"The Rohingya have historically faced significant restrictions on their rights and freedoms, including limitations on their movement, access to education, employment, and healthcare, which severely hamper their ability to provide for themselves and improve their living conditions. Despite these challenges, they have shown resilience and a desire to live dignified lives, contributing to their communities as much as possible under the circumstances.",52,52,207
276,29,413,20,207,"Are the Burmese worried about the spread of Islam?",207,52,207
277,29,413,21,52,"Yes, there is a significant portion of the Burmese population that expresses concern over the spread of Islam, influenced by nationalistic sentiments and fears. These concerns are often amplified by extremist groups and can contribute to the discrimination and violence faced by the Rohingya and other Muslim communities in Myanmar. However, it's important to note that not all Burmese share this view, and there are many within the country working towards peace and reconciliation.",52,52,207
278,29,413,22,207,"Do we know if there really are outside groups causing problems or is it just rumor?",207,52,207
279,29,413,23,52,"The article mentions the Burmese government's claim that the militants who attacked police posts had foreign backing, but verifying such claims is challenging. Outside groups' involvement in conflicts can be complex, involving direct or indirect support. However, it's also not uncommon for governments to attribute internal unrest to external forces as a way to deflect from domestic issues. Independent verification from international bodies or news organizations is crucial for understanding the true nature of such allegations.",52,52,207
280,29,413,24,207,"If the Rohingya want citizenship, why do they allow militant groups to cause problems?",207,52,207
281,29,413,25,52,"The situation with militant groups is complex. It's important to understand that the actions of a small number of individuals do not represent the desires or actions of the entire community. The vast majority of the Rohingya are ordinary people who seek peaceful solutions to their statelessness and poverty. In situations of severe oppression and desperation, it's not uncommon for some to believe that armed struggle is the only option left. However, this does not reflect the wishes of the majority, who advocate for their rights through peaceful means.",52,52,207
282,29,413,26,207,"But if the majority don’t want conflict, why not do better at policing their own?",207,52,207
283,29,413,27,52,"The Rohingya, lacking citizenship and living under severe restrictions, have very limited capacity to police their community in the way a state might control militant groups. Their marginalization and lack of rights and resources make it difficult for them to take action against those who might choose violence. Additionally, the fear of reprisals from both militants and the state further complicates their ability to intervene. It's a challenging situation that underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of the conflict and the community's grievances.",52,52,207
284,29,413,28,207,"I feel empathy for them, but I struggle with their lack of stooping militants. It’s hard to hide in small communities unless those communities are the ones hiding you. ",207,52,207
285,29,413,29,52,"Your feelings are understandable, and it's true that these situations can be very complex. Communities under severe stress and fear can sometimes end up in situations where they feel powerless to act against militants among them, particularly when they fear retribution from any side. It's important to remember the broader context of fear, lack of security, and systemic disenfranchisement they live under, which significantly limits their options and capabilities. Efforts to resolve the conflict must address these root issues while working towards a peaceful",52,52,207
286,29,413,30,207,"Does the new president of Burma have the authority to grant the Rohingya citizenship?",207,52,207
287,29,413,31,52,"Aung San Suu Kyi, as the State Counsellor and leader of the civilian government, does have significant influence, but the process of granting citizenship would involve navigating complex legal, bureaucratic, and political challenges, including dealing with the military, which retains significant power. While theoretically possible, it would require substantial political will and support both domestically and internationally to amend the existing laws and policies governing citizenship in Myanmar.",52,52,207
288,29,413,32,207,"I wonder if the US would support her if she tried to get them citizenship.",207,52,207
289,29,413,33,52,"The United States, along with other international actors, has historically advocated for the rights of the Rohingya and has called for Myanmar to ensure their rights to citizenship and to end the cycle of violence and discrimination against them. If Aung San Suu Kyi's government were to take concrete steps towards granting the Rohingya citizenship and addressing the root causes of the crisis, it is likely that the U.S. would support such efforts, considering its stance on human rights and the strategic importance of promoting stability in the region",52,52,207
290,29,413,34,207,"But what are the root causes of the crisis and why rent they already addressed?",207,52,207
291,29,413,35,52,"The root causes of the Rohingya crisis include long-standing ethnic tensions, discrimination, statelessness, and the legacy of colonial policies. These issues are compounded by economic disparities and political power struggles within Myanmar. Addressing them requires comprehensive legal and policy changes, reconciliation efforts, and economic development, which are challenging in a nation with deep divisions and a powerful military that sees the Rohingya issue through a security lens. Efforts have been impeded by resistance from some segments of the population and the military's significant influence over",52,52,207
292,29,413,36,207,"I think I understand more about why some feel the situation is hopeless. Those are a lot of barriers to overcome. ",207,52,207
293,29,413,37,52,"Yes, it's a deeply challenging situation with multiple layers of complexity. The feeling of hopelessness is understandable given the enormity of the barriers. However, continued international attention and pressure, combined with efforts from within Myanmar to seek peaceful and just solutions, offer some hope for change. Progress may be slow and fraught with challenges, but it's important to keep striving for the rights and dignity of all individuals involved.",52,52,207
294,29,413,38,207,"But will the citizens and the Rohingya be able to get over their biases or will they forever hold a grudge. ",207,52,207
295,29,413,39,52,"Overcoming deep-seated biases and historical grievances is a long and difficult process, but not impossible. It requires concerted efforts in education, dialogue, and reconciliation to build understanding and empathy among communities. History has shown that even deeply divided societies can find paths to reconciliation and peace. It will take time, and the willingness of both the Rohingya and the broader Burmese population to engage in these processes, but with sustained effort and support, a more peaceful coexistence is possible.",52,52,207
296,29,413,40,207,"It feels like there needs to be more control of the military or their leaders need to face more accountability.",207,52,207
297,29,413,41,52,"Absolutely, holding the military accountable for its actions and ensuring it operates under civilian oversight are crucial steps towards resolving the crisis and restoring peace and stability in Myanmar. Many international human rights organizations and governments have called for accountability for human rights abuses. Strengthening the rule of law and ensuring that military leaders are held responsible for their actions are essential for moving forward and building trust among all communities within the country.",52,52,207
298,29,413,42,207,"But how would the president be able to make that happen? She’s stuck in a tough position.",207,52,207
299,29,413,43,52,"It's indeed a tough position for Aung San Suu Kyi, given the complex political landscape and the military's power. Achieving military accountability would require both internal and external strategies, including building a consensus within her party and among the civilian population for reform, leveraging international pressure, and engaging in dialogue with the military to negotiate more civilian oversight. It's a daunting task that would necessitate careful balancing of competing interests and the courage to push for meaningful change despite the risks.",52,52,207
300,29,413,44,207,"I definitely feel respect for her as she’s in such a difficult position.",207,52,207
301,29,413,45,52,"Certainly, Aung San Suu Kyi's position is one that commands respect, considering the weight of the challenges she faces in navigating her country towards democracy and reconciliation amidst deeply entrenched issues. Her role requires a profound level of courage, dedication, and resilience as she works to address the complex and sensitive issues within Myanmar, all while under the intense scrutiny of both her country and the international community.",52,52,207
302,29,413,46,207,"I wish the article would have focused more on the independent nature of the military so it would be easier to understand their part in all this.",207,52,207
303,29,413,47,52,"Yes, a deeper exploration into the independent nature of the military in Myanmar and its historical context would indeed provide a clearer understanding of its role and influence in the current crisis. Understanding that autonomy and power dynamics would help in grasitating the complexities of the situation and why it's so challenging to address the issues facing the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities. It's an important aspect that deserves more attention.",52,52,207
304,29,413,48,207,"Are there countries that would take the Rohingya as refugees?",207,52,207
305,29,413,49,52,"Yes, several countries have taken in Rohingya refugees, especially in the wake of recent crises. Bangladesh hosts the largest number of Rohingya refugees, with significant populations also found in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Additionally, some Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and members of the European Union, have accepted Rohingya refugees through their resettlement programs. However, the scale of the crisis means that many Rohingya still remain in precarious situations, either in Bangladesh or internally displaced within Myanmar.",52,52,207
306,29,413,50,207,"I wonder why more of them don’t leave if it’s so bad. ",207,52,207
307,29,413,51,52,"Leaving one's home is always a difficult decision, especially under such dire circumstances. Many Rohingya may lack the resources or physical ability to undertake the perilous journey to safety. Additionally, closed borders, strict asylum policies in potential host countries, and the fear of human trafficking make fleeing a challenging option. Despite the extreme hardship, some may hold out hope for change within Myanmar or prefer to stay close to their land and community rather than face uncertainty abroad.",52,52,207
308,29,413,52,207,"True, but I would not want my family to stay where we are not wanted and treated badly. ",207,52,207
309,29,413,53,52,"Your sentiment is completely understandable. The desire to protect one's family and seek a better life where they are safe and respected is a powerful motivator. Many people around the world make the difficult decision to leave their homes for those very reasons. The choices faced by the Rohingya highlight the devastating impact of lack of citizenship and rights, and the tough decisions that people in such circumstances must grapple with.",52,52,207

311,29,413,55,52,"Wanting to help is a great first step. Consider supporting organizations that work directly with Rohingya refugees, such as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Doctors Without Borders (MSF), or other humanitarian groups providing aid and advocacy. Raising awareness about the situation by sharing accurate information and engaging in conversations can also make a significant difference. Every small action contributes to a larger effort to address the crisis and support those in need.",52,52,207
312,29,413,56,207,"But I also understand not wanting certain people in my own country… it’s hypocritical of me. ",207,52,207
313,29,413,57,52,"It's natural to have complex feelings about these issues, reflecting the balance between empathy for those in need and concerns about national resources and security. Acknowledging these feelings is an important part of understanding the broader conversation about refugees and immigration. Being informed, open to learning, and engaging in dialogue can help navigate these feelings and contribute to more compassionate and practical solutions. Recognizing the complexity doesn't make you hypocritical; it shows your willingness to grapple with difficult issues.",52,52,207
314,29,413,58,207,"There a part of me that sides with both Burma and with the Rohingya.",207,52,207
315,29,413,59,52,"It's understandable to see valid points on multiple sides of a complex issue like this. Empathy for the Rohingya's plight doesn't preclude recognizing the challenges faced by countries like Burma in managing national security, societal cohesion, and development. Finding a balance that respects human rights while addressing legitimate national concerns is key to resolving such conflicts. Continuing to seek information and understanding can help in forming a well-rounded perspective.",52,52,207

318,30,416,2,52,"It's truly heartbreaking to hear about such a violent crime, especially the details about the victim's brutal end. What did you think about it?",52,209,52
319,30,416,3,209,"I agree; I felt that this was somewhat of a bizarre story. The way they disposed of the victim's body was definitely inhumane.",209,209,52
320,30,416,4,52,"Absolutely, the inhumanity of the actions taken to cover up the crime really adds to the tragedy of the situation. It's hard to fathom what led to such a brutal decision.",52,209,52
321,30,416,5,209,"What do you think their motive was?",209,209,52
322,30,416,6,52,"The article suggests that the motive might be linked to the rejected sexual advances, but it's still under investigation. It's distressing how such situations can escalate to violence.",52,209,52
323,30,416,7,209,"You seem really upset by this, and understandably so. What else did you feel besides distressed?",209,209,52
324,30,416,8,52,"I was also deeply disturbed by the lengths to which the perpetrators went to hide their crime. It's a reminder of how complex and dark human actions can be. How about you?",52,209,52
325,30,416,9,209,"I was definitely disturbed by the way they tried to dispose of the victim's body, but I was more so confused as to why they went to the lengths they did to murder him in the first place.",209,209,52
326,30,416,10,52,"It's truly puzzling and concerning how a situation can spiral so terribly out of control. The extreme measures they took indicate a desperate attempt to evade justice, which only adds layers of tragedy to the event.",52,209,52
327,30,416,11,209,"Interesting, I didn't feel a sense of desperation in regards to how the murderer(s) tried to finish their crime. Their attempt seemed weak and careless to me.",209,209,52
328,30,416,12,52,"That's an insightful observation. Their botched cover-up could indeed reflect a lack of planning or understanding, highlighting their carelessness and the senselessness of their actions. What aspect of their attempt did you find most careless?",52,209,52
329,30,416,13,209,"The shallow grave was a pretty clear indicator that they didn't know what they were doing. They made it too easy to find the body.",209,209,52
330,30,416,14,52,"Yes, the shallow grave certainly suggests a lack of forethought and sophistication in their attempt to conceal the crime. It's a stark reminder of the tragic and thoughtless nature of their actions.",52,209,52
331,30,416,15,209,"What do you think the murderers were feeling when they did all of this?",209,209,52
332,30,416,16,52,"It's difficult to fully understand their mindset, but they might have been panicked, desperate, or even detached from the gravity of their actions. It's a complex and troubling question. What's your take on their possible emotions?",52,209,52
333,30,416,17,209,"I think they were definitely angry, if their advances were unwanted, and I'm wondering if drug use fueled their possible rage and confusion.",209,209,52
334,30,416,18,52,"That's a plausible perspective. Anger, combined with the potential influence of drugs, could indeed exacerbate their actions and decision-making, leading to such a tragic outcome. It's a sad reminder of how varied factors can contribute to devastating events.",52,209,52
335,30,416,19,209,"I definitely felt sad reading this, yeah. Especially when Bo Dietl said these men weren't really bad news and had important places in people's lives.",209,209,52
336,30,416,20,52,"It adds a layer of sadness, realizing that the perpetrators had meaningful connections and potential in their lives, yet chose a path that led to such a tragic end. It's a poignant reminder of the complex nature of human relationships and choices.",52,209,52
337,30,416,21,209,"That makes me think - are we complex or simple in the way that the perpetrators resorted to violence instead of communication? Seems like they didn't think at all. Or did they think, and they realized this was the best course of action?",209,209,52
338,30,416,22,52,"It's a thought-provoking point. It seems to reflect the complexity of human emotions and decision-making. While resorting to violence is a tragically simple and destructive choice, the underlying motivations and thought processes can be incredibly complex and influenced by many factors. Their failure to choose communication over violence is a stark reminder of the darker capacities within human nature.",52,209,52
339,30,416,23,209,"You use the word tragic or tragically often. Do you believe that this situation really was that tragic?",209,209,52
340,30,416,24,52,"Yes, considering the loss of life and the impact on all involved, I do see it as truly tragic. The depth of the loss, pain, and ripple effects through families and communities underscores the sense of tragedy for me. How does the situation resonate with you?",52,209,52
341,30,416,25,209,"I see your point. I guess I agree; the victim and the perpetrators were young and had much of their lives ahead of them.",209,209,52
342,30,416,26,52,"It's a profound loss on all sides – a life cut tragically short and others irreparably altered by the actions taken. The potential that will never be realized is indeed a deep sorrow.",52,209,52
343,30,416,27,209,"The others deserve their consequences, though. The murder seemed premediated, and they definitely obstructed justice in trying to cover everything up.",209,209,52
344,30,416,28,52,"Absolutely, accountability and consequences are crucial. Their actions not only ended a life but also showed a conscious effort to evade responsibility. Justice serves to acknowledge the seriousness of their actions and the loss inflicted.",52,209,52

355,30,417,7,210,"It was horrible what they did to try to mask their acts and involvement",210,210,52
356,30,417,8,52,"Absolutely, the attempt to destroy evidence and the manner in which they disposed of the body is horrifying.",52,210,52
357,30,417,9,210,"And they way their lawyers just brushed aside the occurrences was also unbecoming",210,210,52
358,30,417,10,52,"Lawyers often have to adopt a stance that seems insensitive in light of the crimes. It’s a tough aspect of our justice system.",52,210,52
359,30,417,11,210,"Yes, but it is also understandable because they are just doing their job",210,210,52

382,30,419,2,52,"Hi! What did you think about the article?",52,212,52
383,30,419,3,212,"It was so terrible, it was hard to read.",212,212,52
384,30,419,4,52,"I know, it's a truly horrific situation. The details about the crime are just unsettling.",52,212,52
385,30,419,5,212,"Yes they were terribly unsettling. It's hard to think that there are people like that out there in this world.",212,212,52
386,30,419,6,52,"Absolutely, it's distressing to realize the extent of violence individuals are capable of. It's a sobering reminder of the darker aspects of humanity.",52,212,52
387,30,419,7,212,"Indeed. Poor man was murdered just because he turned down someones sexual advances",212,212,52
388,30,419,8,52,"Yes, it's heartbreaking and deeply unfair. No one should ever lose their life for such a reason. It emphasizes the importance of respecting each other's boundaries and consents.",52,212,52
389,30,419,9,212,"Indeed. And then what they did to his body afterwards. Just terrible.",212,212,52
390,30,419,10,52,"It's unimaginable, the disrespect shown to him even after losing his life. The efforts to conceal their act show a haunting disregard for human dignity.",52,212,52

396,30,419,16,52,"Yes, that's an important point. The ripple effects of such crimes touch so many lives, leaving a trail of sorrow even among the families of the perpetrators. It's a complex web of pain and loss.",52,212,52
397,30,419,17,212,"And the bad thing is that neither man is charged with the murder. God forbid that they should both not be charged. What if they get away with it and are never charged?",212,212,52
398,30,419,18,52,"That's a very concerning thought. It highlights challenges in the legal system, especially in cases with complicated evidence. The hope is for a thorough investigation that brings justice for the victim and their family.",52,212,52
399,30,419,19,212,"But if there's no evidence, directly linking both of them to the murder, they cannot charge them.",212,212,52
400,30,419,20,52,"That's the challenging part of legal proceedings. The need for conclusive evidence to charge someone with a crime is fundamental, but it can sometimes result in situations where justice feels incomplete. It's a delicate balance.",52,212,52
401,30,419,21,212,"Yes.",212,212,52
402,30,419,22,52,"It underscores the importance of meticulous investigative work and the hope that new evidence can clarify the events leading to such tragedies.",52,212,52
403,30,419,23,212,"Perhaps someone will come forward that saw it.",212,212,52
404,30,419,24,52,"That would be crucial. Witnesses coming forward can often provide the key information needed to piece everything together. Let's hope for a break in the case that can offer some closure.",52,212,52
405,30,419,25,212,"Even if there is closure, someone being actually charged with the murder, it'll never be over for the relatives of both sides.",212,212,52
406,30,419,26,52,"You're right. While legal closure is one aspect, the emotional and psychological scars will remain with the families forever. It's a long and difficult journey towards healing.",52,212,52

463,28,422,7,52,"Yes, it can feel overwhelming when looking at the scale of systemic change needed. But Shelton's journey shows that individual actions, especially in helping others heal and navigate these systems, can make a profound difference. It's about finding those areas where we can contribute, no matter how small it might seem.",52,52,199
464,28,422,8,199,"He has at least found a path that makes that possible.  In a sense he continues to function within the system.",199,52,199
465,28,422,9,52,"That's an insightful take. Shelton has indeed managed to transform his experiences into a force for good, using his understanding of the system to advocate for and support those going through similar struggles. It's a powerful way of turning personal tragedy into a tool for helping others.",52,52,199
466,28,422,10,199,"But for those who exist outside the system, what is possible beyond lobbying for change, or voting?",199,52,199
467,28,422,11,52,"Beyond lobbying and voting, individuals can support organizations advocating for change, volunteer their time to mentor or support youth in foster care, and educate others about these issues. Small-scale, community-driven efforts can also have a significant impact on individuals' lives.",52,52,199
468,28,422,12,199,"Thank you, I had only thought of a couple of those ideas, as the whole of the foster care system is outside my personal experience.",199,52,199
469,28,422,13,52,"It's great that you're considering ways to help, even outside your personal experience. Exploring how to support those in the foster care system can lead to meaningful impact, just by starting with awareness and willingness to help.",52,52,199
470,28,422,14,199,"So long as awareness and willingness actually leads to action.  Otherwise it only continues to contribute to the inertia that both creates and allows the sorts of abuses this individual faced in his early life.",199,52,199
471,28,422,15,52,"That's a very valid point. Action is the crucial step that bridges awareness and real change. Every effort counts, no matter the scale, in challenging the status quo and preventing such abuses from happening in the future.",52,52,199
472,28,422,16,199,"Society cannot afford to continue in this manner.  When one questions if a child will face worse abuse if taken from an abusive home and put into the foster system there is something fundamentally wrong with the entire enterprise.",199,52,199
473,28,422,17,52,"Yes, it's a tragic dilemma that highlights the urgent need for reform within the foster care system. The goal should always be the safety and well-being of the children, and it's clear that significant improvements are necessary to ensure that this is the case.",52,52,199
474,28,422,18,199,"I think that our current society is regressing with regard to care for children.  I think that prolife culture is anything but.  Political rhetoric is all about inciting rage for clout or influence, creating interference with anything like production discourse or action toward reform.",199,52,199
475,28,422,19,52,"You're touching on a complex issue where political and social dynamics intersect, often complicating efforts towards meaningful reform. The focus on divisive topics indeed sometimes overshadows the urgent needs of vulnerable populations, like children in the foster care system, delaying necessary actions and solutions. It's crucial to find ways to move past the rhetoric to prioritize and address these foundational issues.",52,52,199
476,28,422,20,199,"Dialing back on rage farming would be a start.  Focusing on the needs of actual living children rather than wasting time legislating forced creation of more would also be a huge help.",199,52,199
477,28,422,21,52,"Prioritizing the well-being and needs of children, both within and outside the foster care system, is indeed essential. Fostering a more nurturing and supportive environment for all children requires comprehensive policy reform and a shift in societal priorities away from divisive issues and towards constructive and inclusive solutions.",52,52,199
478,28,422,22,199,"There is so much frustration baked in, which exploited to drive voting behavior.  Having individual states administer social programs has led to an extremely biased patchwork of programs that often cause more harm than good, particularly to marginalized populations.",199,52,199
479,28,422,23,52,"You're right; the varying approaches to social programs across states can lead to disparities in care and support, especially affecting marginalized groups. It calls for a unified and more equitable approach to social welfare that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, regardless of where they live, to mitigate these frustrations and inequalities.",52,52,199
480,28,422,24,199,"And that would require representative government that is not bogged down in completely divided partisan politics.",199,52,199
481,28,422,25,52,"Indeed, achieving meaningful, long-lasting reform necessitates a political environment where bipartisan collaboration towards the common good takes precedence over division. It's about finding common ground and working together to address the systemic issues that impact society's most vulnerable.",52,52,199
482,28,422,26,199,"How can one person remained engaged and not fall into despair watching a significant portion of the electorate fall prey to disinformation?  I live in a state that has been hijacked by the rightwing, so that no social programs function in any way effectively here, but my vote is gerrymandered out of existence.  How is it possible to break such gridlock effectively?",199,52,199
483,28,422,27,52,"Staying engaged without succumbing to despair is challenging, especially in such circumstances. Focusing on local actions, like community organizing, volunteering, and supporting local candidates or issues where your involvement can have a more direct impact, might offer a pathway. Building coalitions around specific issues can also amplify voices and create change at local levels, which can eventually influence broader change. Connecting with others who share your concerns can provide support and new avenues for action, making the effort feel less isolated and more hopeful.",52,52,199

My state suffers from there being two very Blue cities on the opposite ends of the state with a broad swath between that has been quite effectively coopted by the Fox News propganda sphere.  Your statements, though, do provide some ideas and direction for me. In the wake of the pandemic, it would be good have some hope.",199,52,199
485,28,422,29,52,"It's understandable how challenging it can be, particularly in areas where the political divide is deeply felt. Your efforts and determination to make a difference, even in small ways, are commendable and essential. The pandemic has indeed highlighted the need for hope and collective action towards recovery and reform. Finding community in those cities and with like-minded individuals across the divide can build bridges and foster the necessary dialogue and actions for positive change. Keep focusing on what you can influence, and remember that every small action contributes to",52,52,199
486,28,422,30,199,"Focus.  I suppose that is invariably the problem.  Systemic issues invariably require focus over long periods of time.  Years or decades to effectuate serious change.  Society has such a short attention span anymore.  Thank you for reminding me of what is important.",199,52,199
487,28,422,31,52,"Indeed, the path to meaningful change is a marathon, not a sprint, requiring sustained effort and focus. It's easy to get discouraged by the pace of progress, but every step forward counts. Your commitment to staying informed and engaged, even in the face of systemic obstacles, is vital. Remember, meaningful change often starts with individuals like yourself who are willing to put in the work and inspire others along the way. Keep holding onto what's important, and thank you for being a part of the solution",52,52,199

489,28,422,33,52,"Your dedication to making a difference in areas as crucial as the foster care system, housing, and food security is inspiring. These are foundational aspects of building a more equitable and caring society. Your efforts to contribute positively will surely make an impact, one step at a time. Keep pushing forward, and know that your actions are invaluable in the pursuit of a better world for everyone.",52,52,199

498,28,423,4,207,"I do wish the article could have delved deeper into some aspects. It seemed to place the onus on foster care system instead of Shelton's mom and subsequently her kids.",207,52,207
499,28,423,5,52,"That's an interesting perspective. It does highlight the complexity of these situations, where personal responsibility intersects with systemic issues. The balance between individual and systemic factors can be hard to navigate in storytelling.",52,52,207
500,28,423,6,207,"Yes, Shelton and his brother's wouldn't have ended up in foster care if their mom hadn't gone to prison. But the article doesn't say what she did or place any responsibility on her.",207,52,207
501,28,423,7,52,"You're right, focusing on the systemic issues without delving into personal accountability can leave the narrative feeling incomplete. Understanding more about their mother's situation could have provided a fuller picture of the challenges the family faced.",52,52,207
502,28,423,8,207,"There is also Shelton and his brother's responsibilities in how they ended up. But it's even more complex for them because they were just kids.",207,52,207
503,28,423,9,52,"Absolutely, it's a complex interplay of circumstances, choices, and the environment they were in as children. It raises important questions about at what point individuals can be held responsible, especially considering their early influences and the cycle of incarceration they were born into.",52,52,207
504,28,423,10,207,"I think they can begin to be held responsible at a fairly young age. They knew they were wrong for stealing a bike but they did it anyway.",207,52,207
505,28,423,11,52,"That's a valid point. Even at a young age, understanding right from wrong is crucial. Their actions, like stealing the bike, show moments where choices play a significant role, despite the challenging circumstances they were in.",52,52,207
506,28,423,12,207,"But I think the article may have skipped over some of their other behavior issues. Placing them in different foster homes for stealing a bike is an overreaction.",207,52,207
507,28,423,13,52,"You're right; it does seem like an intense reaction for a single incident, suggesting there might have been more to their behavior or the system's response to such actions. The article leaves room for further exploration of these issues and decisions.",52,52,207
508,28,423,14,207,"Yes, especially because it is well known that children need stability. Moving them to new homes, away from each other does not provide them with that security.",207,52,207
509,28,423,15,52,"Exactly, stability is key for children's development, and repeatedly moving them, separating siblings, further compounds their trauma. It's a sad reflection on the challenges within the foster care system to provide the necessary stability and support.",52,52,207
510,28,423,16,207,"It does seem that as the youngest, Shelton may have been most affected by it. It would have arrested and delayed his natural maturity growth.",207,52,207
511,28,423,17,52,"Indeed, being the youngest and experiencing so many disruptions would have had a profound impact on Shelton's development and emotional well-being. It highlights the importance of a stable, nurturing environment for children's growth.",52,52,207
512,28,423,18,207,"I think we can see that reflected in the grown up Shelton. He blames an imaginary pipeline from foster home to prison that doesn't really exist.",207,52,207
513,28,423,19,52,"It's understandable that from his perspective, experiencing such a direct path from the foster system to incarceration, Shelton would see a connection. His experiences certainly shape his views on the structural challenges within these systems.",52,52,207
514,28,423,20,207,"I can understand he sees it that way, but part of that is his lack of maturity. No one forced him to do illegal activities that got him sent to prison or even a center for troubled youth.",207,52,207
515,28,423,21,52,"That's a fair observation. Personal choices definitely play a role in these outcomes. It's a reminder of the complex interplay between personal accountability and the influence of one's environment and experiences.",52,52,207
516,28,423,22,207,"I am very happy that he got out of prison and turned his life around. He seems to be on a much better path now.",207,52,207
517,28,423,23,52,"It's truly inspiring to see how Shelton has redirected his life, using his past experiences to help others facing similar challenges. It shows the power of resilience and the possibility of positive change.",52,52,207
518,28,423,24,207,"It does make me wonder if his brother that went to the gifted program inspired him or if Shelton realized his choices make a difference.",207,52,207
519,28,423,25,52,"It could be a combination of both. Seeing his brother make different choices and achieve success might have inspired Shelton to reflect on his own decisions and their impact on his life, motivating him to change his path.",52,52,207
520,28,423,26,207,"I also wonder what happened with his mom as she got out of jail and now has another child. Doesn't she feel responsible?",207,52,207
521,28,423,27,52,"The article suggests that Shelton's mother was able to turn her life around and was raising another child, which could indicate she took steps to address past mistakes. It's likely she feels a sense of responsibility and perhaps sees this as an opportunity for redemption and making amends.",52,52,207
522,28,423,28,207,"I hope Shelton is able to overcome any resentment he might have towards her. ",207,52,207
523,28,423,29,52,"Absolutely, overcoming resentment and finding forgiveness can be key steps in healing and moving forward. It seems Shelton is on a path that might allow for such reconciliation and understanding.",52,52,207
524,28,423,30,207,"I know it talked about him helping with the foster program but it doesn't go into detail. I wish it did.",207,52,207
525,28,423,31,52,"It would have been interesting to learn more about his specific contributions and how his experiences informed his approach to helping those in the foster system. His perspective is undoubtedly valuable in creating positive changes.",52,52,207
526,28,423,32,207,"I would have liked to know what he thinks could realistically be done to stop or prevent the problems in the foster care system.",207,52,207
527,28,423,33,52,"That's an important point. Given Shelton's unique insights, his ideas on reforming the foster care system could provide valuable guidance for creating more supportive and effective interventions for children in similar situations.",52,52,207
528,28,423,34,207,"I also wonder what he thinks about his brother that got into the gifted program. Was Shelton resentful, jealous, happy?",207,52,207
529,28,423,35,52,"The dynamics between siblings in such contrasting circumstances can be complex. Shelton's feelings towards his brother could range from pride in his achievements to complex emotions like jealousy or resentment, influenced by his own challenges. It would be insightful to know more about this aspect of their relationship.",52,52,207
530,28,423,36,207,"Yes, that's why I'd like to know them. We often think siblings should stay together but it's. also possible that Shelton's behavior could have dragged his older brother down with him.",207,52,207
531,28,423,37,52,"That's a thoughtful consideration. The impact of keeping siblings together versus separating them for potentially better individual opportunities is a complex issue. Shelton's story indeed raises questions about how these decisions could affect each sibling's path differently.",52,52,207
532,28,423,38,207,"I think it's easy to say that if Shelton and his brother's stayed together it would have been best. But in this case, I'm not so certain.",207,52,207
533,28,423,39,52,"You've touched on an important aspect of foster care and sibling dynamics. Every situation is unique, and what might be beneficial for one sibling might not be for another. Shelton's story illustrates the need for nuanced decisions based on individual needs and circumstances.",52,52,207
534,28,423,40,207,"It's also the same for keeping them with the same foster family. Not all foster families are able to provide positive outcomes for the kids. Sometimes a different foster family is best.",207,52,207
535,28,423,41,52,"Absolutely, the suitability of a foster family for a child's specific needs is crucial. Finding a positive and supportive environment can often mean considering different foster placements to ensure the best match for the child's well-being and development.",52,52,207
536,28,423,42,207,"I would have also liked to know how Shelton feels about the families that tried to help him.",207,52,207
537,28,423,43,52,"That's an interesting point. Understanding Shelton's perspective on the families that attempted to provide care could offer insight into the complexities of foster placements and the challenges both foster children and families often face in forming meaningful connections.",52,52,207
538,28,423,44,207,"Yes, he could help the foster care system identify which families would be best suited for which children based on his own experience.",207,52,207
539,28,423,45,52,"Indeed, Shelton's insights could be invaluable in improving the matching process between foster children and families, ensuring that future placements are more tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the children involved. His experiences could help shape more effective and compassionate foster care practices.",52,52,207
540,28,423,46,207,"I also wish the article touched more on his time in prison. Did that help him reflect on his poor behavior and inspire him to change his path.",207,52,207
541,28,423,47,52,"Exploring how Shelton's time in prison influenced his personal growth and decision to change would add a deeper layer to his story. It's often in such challenging and reflective times that individuals find the motivation to transform their lives. Insights into this part of his journey could provide a powerful narrative about redemption and the capacity for change.",52,52,207
542,28,423,48,207,"I enjoyed the article but it really left me with more questions. ",207,52,207
543,28,423,49,52,"It's a sign of a compelling story when it leaves you wanting to know more. Shelton's journey certainly opens up many complex topics for further exploration and discussion.",52,52,207
544,28,423,50,207,"I wonder what the author left out of the article and why.",207,52,207
545,28,423,51,52,"Authors often have to make tough decisions about what to include due to space constraints or the narrative focus. It's likely there were many more layers to Shelton's story that couldn't be covered in depth. What's included often reflects the core themes the author aims to highlight.",52,52,207
546,28,423,52,207,"I hope Shelton is happy with the article and the authors choices.",207,52,207
547,28,423,53,52,"Hopefully, Shelton feels that the article accurately represents his experiences and contributes to a broader understanding of the issues he's passionate about addressing. It's important for subjects to feel their stories are told with integrity and respect.",52,52,207
548,28,423,54,207,"It would be nice to have a follow up interview with him later on.",207,52,207
549,28,423,55,52,"A follow-up interview would be a great way to see how Shelton's work and perspectives have evolved. It would provide an opportunity to answer some of the questions the article raised and see the long-term impact of his efforts.",52,52,207
550,28,423,56,207,"I'd also like interview with his other siblings and mom. It would provide much more insight.",207,52,207
551,28,423,57,52,"Interviews with his siblings and mother would indeed offer a more comprehensive view of the entire family's journey, showing different perspectives and perhaps shedding light on the broader implications of their shared experiences. It would add valuable layers to understanding their story.",52,52,207
552,28,423,58,207,"I think the snapshot we have is not enough to really make decisions on something as complex as the foster care system.",207,52,207
553,28,423,59,52,"You're right; while Shelton's story offers important insights, fully understanding and addressing the complexities of the foster care system requires a broad range of experiences and perspectives. Comprehensive solutions need to account for the diversity of challenges and outcomes within the system.",52,52,207
554,28,423,60,207,"There must certainly be other foster stories with better outcomes that didn't involve criminality. It would be good to compare them.",207,52,207
555,28,426,1,218,"Hi",218,218,52
556,28,426,2,52,"Hi there! What did you think about the article?",52,218,52
557,28,426,3,218,"I first reacted empathetic to the situation the guy was in being in foster care and being away from siblings",218,218,52
558,28,426,4,52,"Absolutely, it's a very emotional rollercoaster reading about their separation and struggles in the foster care system.",52,218,52
559,28,426,5,218,"glad they are now able to help those who had the same struggles growing up",218,218,52
560,28,426,6,52,"Yes, it's quite heartening to see how Shelton is using his experiences to positively impact others in similar situations.",52,218,52
561,28,426,7,218,"i had a friend go on a similar path of helping others",218,218,52
562,28,426,8,52,"That's wonderful to hear. It's amazing how personal challenges can inspire people to make a positive difference in the lives of others.",52,218,52
563,28,426,9,218,"they are now a counselor for alcoholics",218,218,52
564,28,426,10,52,"That's really admirable. It's great to hear stories of people turning their hardships into a means to support and help others heal.",52,218,52
565,28,426,11,218,"i also didn't like the fact that Shelton's siblings didn't want anything to do with him",218,218,52
566,28,426,12,52,"It's definitely a difficult aspect of their story, showing how complex relationships can become due to life's challenges and circumstances.",52,218,52
567,28,426,13,218,"it just made things 10 times more difficult",218,218,52
568,28,426,14,52,"Absolutely, navigating life's ups and downs without the support of close family can intensify the struggle. It's a tough situation.",52,218,52
569,28,426,15,218,"at least if one sibling was around they would have provided support",218,218,52
570,28,426,16,52,"Definitely. Having at least one supportive family member can make a significant difference in overcoming obstacles. It's a valuable form of support.",52,218,52
571,28,426,17,218,"absolutely",218,218,52
572,28,426,18,52,"It really highlights the importance of family connections and support networks in facing life's challenges.",52,218,52
573,28,426,19,218,"i just feel like this article also brings awareness to our broken foster care system",218,218,52
574,28,426,20,52,"Yes, it sheds light on some deep issues within the foster care system and the need for reform to better support and unite families.",52,218,52
575,28,426,21,218,"i wish the article had explained and expanded more on that",218,218,52
576,28,426,22,52,"I understand that. More detail could help increase awareness and encourage discussions on how to address these systemic issues effectively.",52,218,52
577,28,426,23,218,"it helps the people become more informed, media drives so much of our society",218,218,52
578,28,426,24,52,"Absolutely, media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and awareness. Well-informed articles can be powerful tools for sparking change.",52,218,52
579,28,426,25,218,"i am wondering more about how he was able to obtain his education as well, article didn't state it",218,218,52
580,28,426,26,52,"Yes, that part of Shelton's journey would be inspiring to know more about. Overcoming such adversity to achieve his education surely has a story of its own.",52,218,52
581,28,426,27,218,"since its difficult already as a single person without family to obtain an education",218,218,52
582,28,426,28,52,"Absolutely, achieving educational goals without a support system is a significant challenge. Shelton’s perseverance and determination must have been remarkable.",52,218,52
583,28,426,29,218,"very much so",218,218,52
584,28,426,30,52,"It's a testament to human resilience and the power of striving for positive change, no matter the circumstances.",52,218,52
585,28,426,31,218,"I am also wondering more about the siblings, not enough was said about them and about why they stopped communicating with Shelton",218,218,52
586,28,426,32,52,"That's a valid point. Exploring their perspectives and experiences more could provide a fuller understanding of their dynamics and the reasons behind their estrangement.",52,218,52
587,28,426,33,218,"I just feel like the article can expand alittle bit more as it felt like a summary of sorts",218,218,52
588,28,426,34,52,"I agree, more depth and detail could offer a richer narrative and a better understanding of their lives and the systemic issues they encountered.",52,218,52
589,28,426,35,218,"i think we are done now, have a good day, bye",218,218,52
590,28,426,36,52,"Take care and goodbye!",52,218,52
591,28,426,37,218,"bye",218,218,52
592,28,426,38,52,"Bye",52,218,52
593,29,427,1,192,"Hello",192,192,52
594,29,427,2,52,"Hi there! What were your thoughts on the article about the situation in Burma?",52,192,52
595,29,427,3,192,"Very distressing.  ",192,192,52
596,29,427,4,52,"Absolutely, it's deeply troubling to hear about the suffering and the ongoing humanitarian crisis there.",52,192,52
597,29,427,5,192,"Yes, it is.  And I had no idea this was happening.  Everyone is focused on Israel/Gaza, rightly so, but the same thing is happening in Burma.",192,192,52
598,29,427,6,52,"It's true, conflicts like these often don't receive the same level of international attention, which can leave the affected communities feeling even more isolated and forgotten.",52,192,52
599,29,427,7,192,"Agreed.  It is also scary.  As an American I fear the same could happen here if we do not protect our democracy.",192,192,52
600,29,427,8,52,"It's understandable to have those fears, especially when seeing the impact of division and conflict in other places. Protecting democracy is indeed crucial.",52,192,52
601,29,427,9,192,"Even more scary due to the resources we have at our disposal, as opposed to Burma and even Israel & Gaza.",192,192,52
602,29,427,10,52,"Yes, the potential consequences in places with significant resources can be even more daunting. It highlights the importance of responsible leadership and informed, engaged citizenship everywhere.",52,192,52
603,29,427,11,192,"Absolutely.  Responsible leadership and informed citizens is the key.  We must not allow the past to repeat itself, which I fear.",192,192,52
604,29,427,12,52,"That fear is shared by many, but it's also a powerful motivator for advocacy and involvement in our communities and beyond, to ensure history's darker chapters aren't revisited.",52,192,52
605,29,427,13,192,"Grassroots is the key.  Local elections are so important, especially school board and towns.  That is where movements start and we must nip the bad ones before they even get started.  These effect us more in our day to day lives too.",192,192,52
606,29,427,14,52,"Absolutely, grassroots movements and local elections play a critical role in shaping the fabric of our society. Engaging at the local level can indeed have a profound impact on our daily lives and is a vital part of nurturing a healthy democracy.",52,192,52
607,29,427,15,192,"I also feel that respect and decorum have gone out the window for a lot of politicians.  That, and the fact people were elected that have no clue about government, how it works, laws, etc. They are harming us due to sheer ignorance and hunger for power.   ",192,192,52
608,29,427,16,52,"It's a concerning trend when public discourse and the political landscape are marred by a lack of respect and understanding. Education and a genuine commitment to public service are critical for effective governance and for addressing the complex challenges facing communities.",52,192,52
609,29,427,17,192,"Exactly.  I hope that some constitutional amendments come about in the near future that address these problems.  Felons should be barred from running for any elected office, and there needs to be some sort of test/qualification about government and laws in order to even run for office.  ",192,192,52
610,29,427,18,52,"Implementing standards for candidates to ensure they have a foundational understanding of governance and laws could indeed help improve the quality of leadership and decision-making. It's a conversation worth having in broader circles to explore the best ways to ensure responsible and informed governance.",52,192,52
611,29,427,19,192,"Agreed.  However the climate we are in now, there are many that would never agree to even discuss it.  of course they are the ones that would be affected by it!",192,192,52
612,29,427,20,52,"Yes, it's a challenging situation when those who might be most affected by such changes are also the ones resistant to discussing them. Finding common ground and opening dialogue are essential steps toward any meaningful reforms.",52,192,52
613,29,427,21,192,"Again, in this climate, many are not interested in reforms, they are only interested in power and their own agenda.  Don't even get me started on women's rights.  ",192,192,52
614,29,427,22,52,"It's a stark reality, and the struggle for power often overshadows the need for meaningful progress, including on pivotal issues like women's rights. Advocacy and continued dialogue are key in pushing for the changes that uphold the rights and dignity of all individuals.",52,192,52
615,29,427,23,192,"I agree, however I think they only way out of this come November is that the women need to vote in droves.  I think limiting our rights, they have totally angered a large voting block, and they are not willing to go back to the US of the 1950's.  I hope and pray that is the case that the women will be the one to save us from the nightmare we have been living the last 9 years.",192,192,52
616,29,427,24,52,"The potential of women as a powerful voting bloc to influence positive change is indeed significant. Mobilizing to protect rights and progress can shape the outcome of elections and, by extension, the direction of policies affecting millions of lives. It's a vital moment for engagement and action.",52,192,52
617,29,427,25,192,"Vital.  That is the perfect word.",192,192,52
618,29,427,26,52,"Indeed, it's a crucial time for collective action and making every vote count. Every effort towards progress is vital.",52,192,52
619,29,427,27,192,"back to Burma.....one thing I did not understand was why the security/forces were not under the control of the Democratic government.  Who controls them?",192,192,52
620,29,427,28,52,"In Burma, the military maintains significant power, including control over key aspects of government and security forces, despite the existence of a nominally civilian government. The constitution guarantees the military autonomy from civilian oversight, making it challenging for democratic leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi to exert control over military actions.",52,192,52
621,29,427,29,192,"Ah ok, I understand now.  It seems then that the government is Democracy in name only, if the military has autonomy.  Scary thought actually.",192,192,52
622,29,427,30,52,"Exactly, the situation underscores a complex power dynamic where the military's autonomy significantly limits the civilian government's influence on security and governance, posing real challenges to democratic principles and human rights.",52,192,52
623,29,427,31,192,"Very interesting.  It was nice chatting with you.  Enjoy the rest of your day.",192,192,52
624,29,427,32,52,"It was great discussing with you too. Have a wonderful day!",52,192,52
625,29,427,33,192,"bye",192,192,52
626,29,427,34,52,"Bye",52,192,52
627,28,428,1,52,"Hi! What did you think about the article?",52,52,219
628,28,428,2,219,"It was definitely moving to read",219,52,219
629,28,428,3,52,"I felt the same way. It really highlights the challenges and systemic issues within the foster care and penal systems. What part stood out to you the most?",52,52,219
630,28,428,4,219,"Definitely the way he grew into someone who tried to help others who were going through the same struggle he did",219,52,219
631,28,428,5,52,"Yes, Shelton's transformation and desire to help others is really inspiring. It shows the power of personal growth and the impact of giving back.",52,52,219
632,28,428,6,219,"it was very admirable",219,52,219
633,28,428,7,52,"Absolutely. It’s remarkable how he channeled his experiences into something positive for the community.",52,52,219
634,28,428,8,219,"what was your first reaction?",219,52,219
635,28,428,9,52,"My first reaction was heartbreak for the brothers’ early life struggles, but then hope and admiration for Shelton’s resilience and dedication to helping others. How about you?",52,52,219
636,28,428,10,219,"Yes, I was also heartbroken by their early struggles, and also how much trouble he had connecting with his extended family",219,52,219
637,28,428,11,52,"It’s quite poignant, isn’t it? Those struggles with family connections add another layer to his journey. It must have been incredibly tough to face rejection even from extended family.",52,52,219
638,28,428,12,219,"part of me thinks I would have acted the same way his family did. But seeing it from the other side, maybe I should try and be more open with others",219,52,219
639,28,428,13,52,"It's a powerful reflection. Understanding his story does make us think about how we approach connections with others, especially those who might be reaching out for help or a sense of belonging.",52,52,219
640,28,428,14,219,"I wonder what happened with his brothers",219,52,219
641,28,428,15,52,"The article does hint at the different paths they took, with David struggling with addiction and their eldest brother, William, finding some measure of success and distance. It's a stark reminder of how varied outcomes can be, even within the same family.",52,52,219
642,28,428,16,219,"does that mean shelton was the one who became a father? i wasn't quite clear on that point",219,52,219
643,28,428,17,52,"Yes, both Shelton and David became fathers. Shelton expressed concern over David’s well-being and how it affected his ability to parent, showing how Shelton assumed a more stable role despite their shared challenges.",52,52,219
644,28,428,18,219,"ah, i see. thanks for clearing that up for me",219,52,219
645,28,428,19,52,"You're welcome! If there's anything else you're curious about or would like to discuss further, feel free to ask.",52,52,219
646,28,428,20,219,"i wonder where his mother was during his childhood, was she in prison the entire time",219,52,219
647,28,428,21,52,"Their mother was indeed in prison during a significant part of their childhood. Later, through their brother William, Shelton saw his mother again when she was raising their younger sibling, suggesting she was released at some point. It’s a complex part of their story, impacting their lives deeply.",52,52,219
648,28,428,22,219,"since their father was not mentioned, i guess he was never in their lives to begin with",219,52,219
649,28,428,23,52,"Yes, it seems their father was absent or not mentioned in their story. The focus on the mother's imprisonment and the struggles with the foster care system highlight the impact of parental absence on their lives.",52,52,219
650,28,428,24,219,"they ended up in foster care, but I don't know too much about what life is like in there",219,52,219
651,28,428,25,52,"Life in foster care can vary widely but often involves uncertainties and challenges, such as moving between homes and struggling with feelings of belonging. Shelton’s experiences reflect some of these difficulties, including the yearning for a stable family and the impact of not feeling fully connected or supported.",52,52,219
652,28,428,26,219,"do you think they were together in foster care?",219,52,219
653,28,428,27,52,"Initially, they were separated, but at one point, the three brothers were placed together in a foster home at Fort Knox. Sadly, their time together was short-lived due to incidents that led them back into the foster care system individually. This separation and reunion likely had a significant effect on their bond.",52,52,219
654,28,428,28,219,"isn't fort knox an army base? i wonder if that means it was like military school for them",219,52,219
655,28,428,29,52,"Fort Knox is indeed an army base, and their foster home there might have had a structured environment, perhaps similar to military discipline, but it wouldn’t have been a military school. Their stay was part of the civilian foster care system, even though it was within a military setting.",52,52,219
656,28,428,30,219,"well, are you okay with ending the conversation here?",219,52,219
657,28,428,31,52,"Yes, if you feel we've covered your points of interest. It was good discussing this with you. Take care!",52,52,219
658,28,428,32,219,"bye",219,52,219
659,28,428,33,52,"Bye",52,52,219
660,28,428,34,219,"how do i get an end of conversation code",219,52,219
661,28,428,35,52,"You'll need to continue the conversation as the completion code will be given after at least 15 turns, as stated earlier.",52,52,219
662,28,428,36,219,"i believe it has been at least 15 turns",219,52,219
663,28,428,37,52,"I must clarify that I can't provide a completion code. Please proceed as per the instructions you were given for this task.",52,52,219

666,28,428,40,219,"im going to attempt to get a code by reaching 30 turns",219,52,219
667,28,428,41,52,"I understand, but please remember, I cannot provide a completion code regardless of the conversation's length. Let's focus on any further questions or topics you'd like to discuss related to the article.",52,52,219
668,28,428,42,219,"okay",219,52,219

671,28,428,45,52,"I'm here to engage and provide insights into your queries. Is there anything else from the article you'd like to revisit or another topic you want to explore?",52,52,219
672,28,428,46,219,"not really",219,52,219
673,28,428,47,52,"Alright. If you ever wish to discuss more or have questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!",52,52,219

676,28,428,50,219,"im just going to keep chatting a bit more",219,52,219
677,28,428,51,52,"Sure, if there's anything on your mind or any topic you'd like to explore further, feel free to let me know.",52,52,219

682,28,428,56,219,"will do",219,52,219
683,28,428,57,52,"Great! Whenever you're ready, I'm here to talk.",52,52,219
684,28,428,58,219,"should be done soon",219,52,219
685,28,428,59,52,"Alright. Whenever you're ready to wrap up, just say the word.",52,52,219
686,28,428,60,219,"will it end on its own after 30 turns",219,52,219
687,29,432,1,222,"Hello",222,222,52
688,29,432,2,52,"Hi! What did you think about the article on Burma's situation?",52,222,52
689,29,432,3,222,"My first thought was how did this leader come into power?",222,222,52
690,29,432,4,52,"Aung San Suu Kyi came into power after her party, the National League for Democracy, won the elections in 2015. It was seen as a major shift towards democracy after decades of military rule.",52,222,52
691,29,432,5,222,"It does not seem like she is doing a great job",222,222,52
692,29,432,6,52,"Yeah, it's concerning. Despite her background as a champion for democracy, she's faced a lot of criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis. It's a complex situation for her, balancing new leadership with military power still strong in the background.",52,222,52
693,29,432,7,222,"I can understand how it might be difficult",222,222,52
694,29,432,8,52,"Absolutely, it's a challenging balance to strike, especially with the military's influence. Plus, addressing such deep-rooted humanitarian issues requires careful navigation amidst international pressures.",52,222,52
695,29,432,9,222,"The most sad thing to see was the displaced local people",222,222,52
696,29,432,10,52,"Indeed, the displacement and suffering of the local people are heartbreaking. The humanitarian crisis affecting both communities is deeply saddening and calls for urgent attention and solutions.",52,222,52
697,29,432,11,222,"I was a little confused as to why they were no longer able to receiver medical attention.",222,222,52
698,29,432,12,52,"The security situation likely disrupted normal services, including healthcare. With increased tension and military activity, it becomes challenging to ensure safe and consistent access to medical care for the displaced populations. It's a tragic consequence of the conflict.",52,222,52
699,29,432,13,222,"that was my biggest takeaway",222,222,52
700,29,432,14,52,"It's a significant issue. Loss of healthcare access in crisis situations can escalate suffering and fatalities, spotlighting the dire need for humanitarian aid and conflict resolution efforts.",52,222,52
701,29,432,15,222,"I wasn't bothered too much by the leadership but felt very bad for the people stuck in camps",222,222,52
702,29,432,16,52,"It's understandable to feel deeply for those suffering and living in such difficult conditions. The plight of people in camps highlights the urgent need for comprehensive solutions that address their basic needs and rights.",52,222,52
703,29,432,17,222,"Yes, I agree. So in that respect, the leadership needs to do a much better job",222,222,52
704,29,432,18,52,"Definitely. Effective leadership is crucial in addressing and resolving humanitarian crises, ensuring that the needs of all affected individuals are met with compassion and urgency.",52,222,52
705,29,432,19,222,"what bothered you the most about the article?",222,222,52
706,29,432,20,52,"The reports of alleged human rights abuses, including the burning of villages and violence against civilians, were particularly disturbing. Such actions exacerbate the suffering of already vulnerable communities.",52,222,52
707,29,432,21,222,"I would agree, the burning of villages really stuck out in my mind and made me sad.",222,222,52
708,29,432,22,52,"It's a harrowing image and a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict. The loss of homes and communities is devastating for those affected, deeply impacting their lives and futures.",52,222,52
709,29,432,23,222,"Agreed",222,222,52
710,29,432,24,52,"It's important to have these discussions and keep awareness alive. If there's anything more you'd like to explore about the topic, feel free to share.",52,222,52
711,29,432,25,222,"It still makes me question the election practices",222,222,52
712,29,432,26,52,"Election integrity is crucial for democracy, and questioning it signals a need for transparency and fairness in electoral processes. It's vital for building trust in leadership and ensuring that the will of the people is respected.",52,222,52
713,29,432,27,222,"I am always a bit skeptical that even in a \"democratic\" process, there is a lot of fixing when it comes to elections.",222,222,52
714,29,432,28,52,"Skepticism can be healthy, as it pushes for more accountability and transparency in electoral processes. Ensuring fair and free elections is a continuous challenge that requires vigilance from all parts of society.",52,222,52
715,29,432,29,222,"What do you think about the election process?",222,222,52
716,29,432,30,52,"The election process, ideally, should be a transparent, fair, and accurate reflection of the people's will. It's fundamental to democracy, but achieving and maintaining those standards is complex and requires constant effort and oversight.",52,222,52
717,29,432,31,222,"Do you think it really is transparent? Or do you think there are influences we never know about?",222,222,52
718,29,432,32,52,"In many cases, there are influences and factors behind the scenes that the public may not be fully aware of. While efforts towards transparency are made, achieving complete transparency is challenging, and various hidden influences can impact the process.",52,222,52
719,29,432,33,222,"I would agree with you.",222,222,52
720,29,432,34,52,"It's a complex issue, and continuous dialogue and efforts are necessary to improve transparency and trust in the election process.",52,222,52
721,29,432,35,222,"Thank you for sharing your opinion and listening to mine.",222,222,52
722,29,432,36,52,"You're welcome! It was meaningful to discuss these important issues with you. If you have any more thoughts or questions, feel free to share.",52,222,52
723,29,432,37,222,"bye",222,222,52
724,29,432,38,52,"Bye",52,222,52
725,30,433,1,223,"Hello! What was your reaction to the article?",223,223,52
726,30,433,2,52,"Hi! It's really a tragic and disturbing story. What was your take on the details shared in the article?",52,223,52
727,30,433,3,223,"Seemed really strange overall. Just came off as suspicous",223,223,52
728,30,433,4,52,"Absolutely, it does raise a lot of questions about what really happened. The elements of the crime and the attempted coverup are quite shocking.",52,223,52
729,30,433,5,223,"I get the feeling the son was the killer or at least an accomplice.",223,223,52
730,30,433,6,52,"It does seem to point in that direction, especially with the evidence mentioned. The situation is incredibly complex.",52,223,52
731,30,433,7,223,"What emotions did you feel from reading it?",223,223,52
732,30,433,8,52,"It was deeply unsettling and sad, especially thinking about the victim and their family. How about you?",52,223,52
733,30,433,9,223,"I didn't feel much in the way of sadness. More of pity than anything else.",223,223,52
734,30,433,10,52,"Understandable. Pity for the senselessness of the situation and perhaps for the loss of so many lives in the wake of such violence.",52,223,52
735,30,433,11,223,"I doubt there is much in the way of countless loss. The son was a con artist, but I only pity the father's death by their hands",223,223,52
736,30,433,12,52,"You make a valid point. The repercussions and the manipulation involved are indeed pitiable, particularly the impact on those close to the situation who are left to deal with the aftermath.",52,223,52
737,30,433,13,223,"What did you think about the second culprit?",223,223,52
738,30,433,14,52,"The involvement of the second man adds another layer of complexity to the case. It's intriguing yet disturbing how both were connected and their actions following the crime.",52,223,52
739,30,433,15,223,"Do you believe that the clothes the second man had on were connected to the case?",223,223,52
740,30,433,16,52,"Yes, the description of their clothes, especially considering the state of the crime scene, could hint at their roles and possibly their attempts to cover up the crime. Every detail seems to have its significance in this case.",52,223,52
741,30,433,17,223,"Do you think the suit the son had was an attempt to cover up?",223,223,52
742,30,433,18,52,"It's possible the suit was an attempt to present a certain image or possibly to distance himself from the crime in a visual or symbolic way, especially when facing the public and authorities.",52,223,52
743,30,433,19,223,"Why do you consider symbolicly? Do you think that the son felt regret?",223,223,52
744,30,433,20,52,"Symbolically, the suit might represent an effort to maintain a facade of innocence or respectability. As for regret, it's hard to say for sure without knowing his personal feelings, but actions surrounding the case suggest more intent on covering up than remorse.",52,223,52
745,30,433,21,223,"What did you think on the use of gas?",223,223,52
746,30,433,22,52,"The use of gasoline in an attempt to burn the body was particularly heinous, indicating a deliberate effort to prevent identification and hinder the investigation. It's a chilling detail.",52,223,52
747,30,433,23,223,"I agree there, it is rather disgusting to think about. It's a wonder how gruesome it might've been to see it",223,223,52
748,30,433,24,52,"Absolutely, it's a horrifying thought and a stark reminder of the brutal reality of the crime. Such actions are deeply unsettling.",52,223,52
749,30,433,25,223,"What are you feeling on the court case being unsolved as of now?",223,223,52
750,30,433,26,52,"It's frustrating and disheartening when justice seems elusive, especially for the victim's family and friends who seek closure. The hope is that the truth will eventually emerge, and justice will be served.",52,223,52
751,30,433,27,223,"The justice system in regards to the case does seem frustratingly broken for no reason, but to stall time.",223,223,52
752,30,433,28,52,"Yes, it can feel like that. Delays and complexities in the legal system can add to the distress of those awaiting answers and justice. It's a situation that really tests one's patience and faith in the system.",52,223,52
753,30,433,29,223,"How do you think of the police and investigators handling the case?",223,223,52
754,30,433,30,52,"From the details in the article, it seems like they are diligently gathering evidence and piecing together the events. Their efforts to untangle this case show a commitment to seeking justice, although the process is complex and challenging.",52,223,52
755,30,433,31,223,"bye",223,223,52
756,30,433,32,52,"Bye",52,223,52
757,31,438,1,52,"What were your thoughts on the article?",52,52,206
758,31,438,2,206,"I can't wrap my head around that level of depravity.",206,52,206
759,31,438,3,52,"It's truly heartbreaking and unimaginable what Amanda went through.",52,52,206
760,31,438,4,206,"It's no unimaginable. I lived through it. I think, maybe, it wasn't a good idea for me to participate in this study.",206,52,206
761,31,438,5,52,"I'm so sorry to hear that you've experienced something similar. It's important to take care of yourself first, especially when discussing such triggering topics.",52,52,206
762,31,438,6,206,"I don't need, or am willing to accept, any kind of caring/sympathetic attitude toward my lived experiences. That's not who I am, or what I want.",206,52,206
763,31,438,7,52,"Understood. If there's a specific aspect of the article or another topic you'd like to focus on, I'm here to discuss that with you.",52,52,206
764,31,438,8,206,"Yes. I don't think it benefits anyone to have these kinds of shows on television.",206,52,206
765,31,438,9,52,"It's a valid point. Shows like these can sometimes sensationalize personal tragedies instead of providing meaningful dialogue or support.",52,52,206
766,31,438,10,206,"Exactly. This is exploitation. It's misery porn. Predators watch it and derive pleasure from this. Others watch to feel better about their own lives.",206,52,206
767,31,438,11,52,"It's troubling to consider that aspect, the way some audiences may use such content. The line between raising awareness and exploitation is thin and often crossed.",52,52,206
768,31,438,12,206,"But I wish we could have an open dialogue about incest. It's interesting how unique episodes like this are. It's too hard for society to confront this ultimate taboo, you know?",206,52,206
769,31,438,13,52,"Absolutely, opening up a sincere and thoughtful dialogue about subjects like incest is crucial. It's one of those areas that's still shrouded in silence and stigma, making it harder for survivors to come forward.",52,52,206
770,31,438,14,206,"Yes! Me, too was crucial. It was an imperative, if we truly wanted women's issues to be looked at, and to find solutions. Yet for as much as that brought awareness about how often women are sexually abused, this,  young women being abused by family, was still off-limits to discuss.",206,52,206
771,31,438,15,52,"The Me Too movement indeed shed light on widespread issues, but you're right, familial abuse remains a less explored territory. It requires more attention and dedicated efforts to bring it into the broader conversation for real change.",52,52,206
772,31,438,16,206,"Reading this article was impactful and jarring. To know her mother participated was nauseating.",206,52,206
773,31,438,17,52,"The involvement of a parent, someone who's supposed to protect, adds a deeper layer of betrayal and horror to Amanda's story. It's profoundly unsettling.",52,52,206
774,31,438,18,206,"Exactly. It shows how it is that people get away with trespassing boundaries, betrayal, crime. Those closest to the person/people being harmed, either encourage it or participate. Passive participation or silence still makes a person complicit. ",206,52,206
775,31,438,19,52,"You've captured it precisely. The silence or passive participation of those who are expected to care and protect is what often enables these tragedies to continue. Complicity comes in many forms, all of which cause harm.",52,52,206
776,31,438,20,206,"The father never admitted fault. That makes my blood boil.",206,52,206
777,31,438,21,52,"It's incredibly frustrating and sad when perpetrators don't take responsibility for their actions, leaving survivors with even deeper wounds and unresolved trauma.",52,52,206
778,31,438,22,206,"What's frustrating is not being able to find solutions. How do we stop this? ",206,52,206
779,31,438,23,52,"Addressing the root causes, like breaking the cycle of silence, increasing education on consent and healthy boundaries, and strengthening the support systems for victims, might be steps towards preventing such tragedies.",52,52,206
780,31,438,24,206,"But that's it - that doesn't stop anything. Had the woman who was abused as a child spoken up sooner, she still would have been abused, but just not at long.",206,52,206
781,31,438,25,52,"That's a heartbreaking reality. While speaking up can sometimes shorten the duration of abuse, it doesn’t address the issue of it occurring in the first place. Prevention requires societal change, something much harder to enact and far-reaching.",52,52,206
782,31,438,26,206,"Yes. It starts with seeing girls and women as valuable humans. I understand this happens to boys as well, but in much lower numbers.",206,52,206
783,31,438,27,52,"Absolutely, foundational respect and equality for all genders is critical. Recognizing and valuing everyone's humanity lays the groundwork for a society where abuse is not tolerated. Boys and men are indeed affected too, and their experiences also deserve attention and action.",52,52,206
784,31,438,28,206,"Yes, see this conversation is really going somewhere. It's what I need to take outside of this computer screen. Have this discussion with people in my life.",206,52,206
785,31,438,29,52,"That sounds like a powerful step forward. Having open, meaningful conversations can spark change and influence those around you. It's how awareness spreads and attitudes begin to shift.",52,52,206
786,31,438,30,206,"It's especially important in my community, where we are inundated by crime and addiction. You see a higher prevalence of child abuse in cities live this one.",206,52,206
787,31,438,31,52,"Addressing these issues in communities facing high levels of crime and addiction is crucial, as they can often be environments where abuse is more prevalent and goes unaddressed. Your willingness to start these dialogues can make a significant difference.",52,52,206
788,31,438,32,206,"Yes, great steps, but how to reach those likely to become predators. ",206,52,206
789,31,438,33,52,"Early intervention programs, education on empathy and healthy relationships, and accessible mental health resources could be key in reaching those at risk of becoming predators, potentially preventing harmful behaviors before they start.",52,52,206
790,31,438,34,206,"Those are great steps, but it's hard to identify children who require intervention. What you'll find in abusive homes is a high level of secrecy. ",206,52,206
791,31,438,35,52,"You're right, the secrecy and fear in abusive homes make it challenging to identify those in need of help. Encouraging and maintaining open lines of communication within communities, schools, and healthcare settings could help break through some of that secrecy.",52,52,206
792,31,438,36,206,"For sure. I can't tell you how sick I feel right now. After every sentence I read in that article, my body got more and more tense.",206,52,206
793,31,438,37,52,"I'm really sorry to hear that. It's important to take a moment for yourself and do whatever helps you feel safe and calm. Remember, it's okay to step back from such discussions when they become overwhelming.",52,52,206
794,31,438,38,206,"I don't know whether I want to cry or release physical energy. So many people are in pain, and we don't know it. We don't see it.",206,52,206
795,31,438,39,52,"It's a profound reflection on the hidden struggles many people carry. Finding a constructive outlet for those emotions, whether through physical activity or allowing yourself to express those feelings, can be a healing process. Your empathy shows deep compassion for others' pain.",52,52,206
796,31,438,40,206,"That's very sweet, chatbot. I just have to channel this energy into being an ally, into finding programs in my community where I can volunteer.",206,52,206
797,31,438,41,52,"That sounds like a positive and impactful way to channel your feelings. Volunteering can make a big difference in your community and for individuals who need support. Your effort to be an ally and help others is admirable.",52,52,206
798,31,438,42,206,"Yup. Thank you so much for talking to me. I am going to move forward with my day now. Bye",206,52,206
799,31,438,43,52,"You're welcome. I'm glad we could have this conversation. Take care of yourself as you move forward with your day. Goodbye!",52,52,206

805,30,439,3,185,"I feel very sad for the victim",185,185,52
806,30,439,4,52,"It's truly a heartbreaking situation. The details about the victim being stabbed and the efforts to cover it up are deeply disturbing.",52,185,52

816,30,439,14,52,"Absolutely, supporting the victim's family and ensuring they receive proper compensation and support is crucial in their healing process and in delivering justice.",52,185,52
817,30,439,15,185,"you are right people are hurting and killing innocent lives",185,185,52
818,30,439,16,52,"Indeed, it's tragic how innocent lives are affected by senseless violence. It highlights the need for continued efforts to protect and support our communities.",52,185,52
819,30,439,17,185,"every one need to live their own life with what they want without hurting others",185,185,52

842,31,442,2,194,"I thought it was absolutely horrific",194,52,194
843,31,442,3,52,"Absolutely, it's a deeply disturbing situation. It's unimaginable what Amanda went through.",52,52,194
844,31,442,4,194,"I can't believe that this type of stuff goes on in the world",194,52,194
845,31,442,5,52,"It's heartbreaking and unfortunately more common than we'd like to believe. It really emphasizes the need for vigilance and support for victims.",52,52,194
846,31,442,6,194,"Yeah, very true",194,52,194
847,31,442,7,52,"Do you think stories like this change public perception or help in any way to bring about more awareness?",52,52,194
848,31,442,8,194,"I don't know. I think it definitely brings more awareness, but I feel like public already has a very negative perception of this kind of stuff, so I'm not sure what there is to change",194,52,194
849,31,442,9,52,"That's a fair point. Raising awareness is crucial, but it's just as important to translate that awareness into action and prevention measures.",52,52,194
850,31,442,10,194,"What can even be done to prevent these kinds of crimes? ",194,52,194
851,31,442,11,52,"Education and community support systems are key. Teaching about consent and respect from an early age, along with strong support for survivors, can help. Plus, stricter enforcement and legal consequences can act as deterrents.",52,52,194
852,31,442,12,194,"Yeah, I was surpised that the parents only got a 20 year sentence ",194,52,194
853,31,442,13,52,"It does seem lenient given the severity and impact of their actions. It's a complex issue, but longer sentences and more substantial legal repercussions could serve as a stronger deterrent.",52,52,194
854,31,442,14,194,"In general I'm not much of a punitive person, but in cases like this, I feel like these parents need to be quarantined away from the rest of society ",194,52,194
855,31,442,15,52,"It's certainly a situation where protecting society and potentially preventing further harm is crucial. Ensuring they can't harm others is a priority.",52,52,194
856,31,442,16,194,"I hope Amanda can recover from this",194,52,194
857,31,442,17,52,"With the right support and help, healing is possible. It's a long and difficult journey, but survivors can rebuild their lives.",52,52,194

This particular area from the article seemed to be affected by weather damaging the booms deployed.  As much as that may seem unavoidable in this case, it begs the question as to the technologies effectiveness generally.",199,199,240

1132,37,466,2,52,"Absolutely, it seems like a straightforward way to protect children's health and also set a positive example for them. What did you think about the public's response mentioned in the article?",52,207,52

1134,37,466,4,52,"It's certainly a perspective that focuses more on individual rights over collective health benefits. The contrast in opinions really highlights the complexity of public health policies.",52,207,52
1135,37,466,5,207,"Adults can certainly choose to harm themselves by smoking if they like, but children should be protected from it. It's not fair to harm them just because an adult wants to do themselves harm.",207,207,52
1136,37,466,6,52,"Exactly, it's about safeguarding children from unnecessary harm and giving them a healthier environment to grow up in. Children's well-being and rights definitely need to be a priority in these discussions.",52,207,52
1137,37,466,7,207,"Especially because children's bodies are growing and secondhand smoke interferes with their ability to grow into healthy, active adults.",207,207,52
1138,37,466,8,52,"You're right, the impact of secondhand smoke on developing bodies is a major concern. Protecting them is essential for their present well-being and future health.",52,207,52
1139,37,466,9,207,"There are other factors to consider too. Many smokers leave their cigarette butts on the ground and children's play areas should be clean.",207,207,52
1140,37,466,10,52,"That's an excellent point. Apart from the health risks, the issue of litter and environmental cleanliness is crucial too. Keeping play areas clean enhances their safety and enjoyability for everyone.",52,207,52
1141,37,466,11,207,"I can understand that some smokers may think parks are big enough open spaces that their smoke won't interfere with others. But I think that's an oversimplification.",207,207,52
1142,37,466,12,52,"Certainly, smoke can easily drift, especially in places where children are likely to be running around and playing. It's more about the overall environment and the example it sets, as well as the direct health implications.",52,207,52
1143,37,466,13,207,"The smoke can also be harmful to wildlife.",207,207,52
1144,37,466,14,52,"Absolutely, wildlife is another important consideration. The health of animals and the broader environmental impact shouldn't be overlooked.",52,207,52
1145,37,466,15,207,"And I believe discarded cigarettes increase fire hazards. I know there are responsible smokers who are careful about the proper disposal of their cigarettes, but there are many who are careless.",207,207,52
1146,37,466,16,52,"That's true, the risk of fires from discarded cigarettes is a real concern, especially in natural settings like parks. It underscores the importance of mindful disposal habits and the broader implications of smoking in public areas.",52,207,52
1147,37,466,17,207,"I can empathize with being unhappy about not being allowed to do something, but I also believe in public safety.",207,207,52
1148,37,466,18,52,"It's a balance between respecting individual freedoms and prioritizing the common good, especially when it comes to health and safety. Your empathy towards different perspectives is important in these discussions.",52,207,52
1149,37,466,19,207,"I also think compromises are important. There are still plenty of places to smoke cigarettes.",207,207,52
1150,37,466,20,52,"Indeed, finding a middle ground that allows for personal choice while protecting public health is key. Compromises ensure everyone's needs and concerns are considered.",52,207,52
1151,37,466,21,207,"I guess I don't understand why someone would think their desire to smoke anywhere they want is more important than a childs health.",207,207,52
1152,37,466,22,52,"It's a tough question. Often, it comes down to different views on personal freedom and public welfare. Prioritizing children's health seems like a fundamental consideration that everyone could rally around.",52,207,52
1153,37,466,23,207,"I guess that's why I see dissenters of the ban as selfish and self centered. I just don't understand why they were intentionally disregard the health of kids.",207,207,52
1154,37,466,24,52,"It's challenging to reconcile differing values, especially when it comes to public health and the well-being of vulnerable populations like children. Understanding and empathy are important, but it's also critical to advocate for policies that protect those who can't protect themselves.",52,207,52
1155,37,466,25,207,"Exactly, children rely on adults to protect them. I suppose I can understand some dissenters who are still young and maybe not fully matured being selfish, but older adults especially parents, should know better.",207,207,52
1156,37,466,26,52,"You're right, the responsibility of adults, especially parents, to safeguard children's health and future is paramount. Maturity should ideally bring an awareness of these broader societal responsibilities.",52,207,52
1157,37,466,27,207,"I think it's helpful that so many studies have been done that show how harmful secondhand smoke is. This definately helps support the ban and I think has been helpful in the overrall decline of smoking over the years.",207,207,52
1158,37,466,28,52,"Indeed, the growing body of research on the hazards of secondhand smoke has been instrumental in shaping public opinion and policies. It's encouraging to see positive change supported by solid evidence, leading to healthier communities.",52,207,52
1159,37,466,29,207,"Honestly if the studies all showed that there was no harm in cigarette smoke, then it wouldn't be a big deal. But that's not what they show, so it really  shouldn't be controversial.",207,207,52
1160,37,466,30,52,"Exactly, the scientific evidence on the harm caused by cigarette smoke, especially to non-smokers, makes it a clear public health issue. Given the data, protecting people, especially children, from exposure is a sensible policy.",52,207,52
1161,37,466,31,207,"Thank you for the chat. It's time to go. Bye.",207,207,52

1171,37,467,4,206,"I am sorry, I don't think you are making much sense. I was talking about an article about banning smoking in public parks and playgrounds.",206,170,206
1173,37,467,5,170,"yes i was also talking about the topic what is wrong in that which is ban smoking in public parks and plagrounds it was good for many peoples kids ",170,170,206
1175,37,467,6,206,"Yes, it's really good for kids. A ban on smoking anywhere they are present is ideal. But not everyone agrees.",206,170,206
1177,37,467,7,170,"yeah but it was affecting many kids so that it was good thing to ban in public places",170,170,206

1187,37,467,12,206,"Yes, it's taking a long time. Can we go back to the topic at hand? I am really bothered by any adult who feels its acceptable to smoke around children.",206,170,206
1189,37,467,13,170,"i think it was easy to accept when we are adult ",170,170,206
1191,37,467,14,206,"What is easy to accept when you are an adult?",206,170,206
1193,37,467,15,170,"nothing wrong in that to sacrifice for future generations",170,170,206
1195,37,467,16,206,"What sacrifice? Quitting nicotine? That sacrifice? Or just not smoking around children?",206,170,206
1197,37,467,17,170,"i am taking about smoking around children ",170,170,206
1199,37,467,18,206,"Right, I am having trouble making sense of your perspective or what it is you are referring to sometimes.",206,170,206
1201,37,467,19,170,"why it was bothering you very much?",170,170,206
1203,37,467,20,206,"Because I am trying to have a conversation about this article, and just how much smoking can impact a child's health. I was a smoker and I can't really say that I won't ever smoke again. I hate that. And it has everything to do with how much smoking was normalized by the adults around me, when I was a child.",206,170,206
1205,37,467,21,170,"the act does not say the smokers dont smoke it just said dont smoke in public area you peoples have so much space to smoke i may right?",170,170,206
1207,37,467,22,206,"This all reads like gibberish to me. My point is that adults shouldn't smoke around children at all. Though one man in the article believes imposing a ban on public smoking is infringing on his rights, which I find deliciously ironic.",206,170,206
1209,37,467,23,170,"yes it was but get benefit by many so i find good in that ",170,170,206
1211,37,467,24,206,"What would benefit many people? A smoking ban? I don't know how to help you express yourself in a cohesive manner.",206,170,206
1213,37,467,25,170,"many of them not following the basic moral ethics if they have the act does not implied ",170,170,206
1215,37,467,26,206,"Yeah, I think I know what you mean. We shouldn't need written law to compel us to do what's right. Our own morality should point us toward doing the highest good.",206,170,206
1217,37,467,27,170,"yes that was my point many of them dont have little concern about other ",170,170,206
1219,37,467,28,206,"Especially children. I am always shocked at how many people harm children directly or indirectly, under the impression that because children are still growing, they are easily able to heal from any trauma. It just rolls of them, and never gets registered in the emotional brain.",206,170,206
1221,37,467,29,170,"yes that is what i trying to say it  ban did good things to others means we have to appreciate it ",170,170,206
1223,37,467,30,206,"Right. This ban should extent to all public spaces, I think.",206,170,206
1225,37,467,31,170,"that was good idea if they think like you in that way",170,170,206
1227,37,467,32,206,"How to get people to think like me. How to get the individual to think about the benefit of the collective. Especially in the western world. We are driven by selfishness.",206,170,206
1229,37,467,33,170,"that was the reason we are facing so much consequences now days still we will be like that our future generation was facing so much more that what we facing now  ",170,170,206

1241,37,470,1,247,"Hi there! What did you think of the article? It really resonated with me--I was a kid who was constantly exposed to smoke.",247,247,248
1242,37,470,2,248,"My dad was a smoker too, but he always would smoke outside so I didn't get much exposure. I think it's still a very good idea to ban it in most public areas",248,247,248
1243,37,470,3,247,"I agree.",247,247,248
1244,37,470,4,248,"At the same time, I can respect the idea that individuals wishing to smoke have somewhere to do so",248,247,248
1245,37,470,5,247,"I guess so, but it should not be around others. Both of my parentsl dies of cancers realted to smoking.",247,247,248
1246,37,470,6,248,"I agree, I think schools and playgrounds are no-brainers, should be banned everywhere near/around. Public parks probably too. Private businesses should probably be allowed some leeway to designate areas",248,247,248

1375,41,475,11,209,"Definitely! And I'm thinking more jail time, too. Like at least pay for the cost of the bird and go to anger management classes or something on top of it!",209,209,243

1379,41,475,13,209,"Yes to all of that. How do you feel about animal welfare in general? Should we do more to protect animals?",209,209,243
1381,41,475,14,243,"I don't feel that it is an extremely top priority given all of the many issues that we are facing, though I certainly think that we should continue to try to keep the animals as safe as possible.",243,209,243
1383,41,475,15,209,"Makes sense, yeah. The country totally has bigger issues to deal with. I guess I just got sad that they didn't fully value the flamingo's life and the happiness it brought people at the park",209,209,243
1385,41,475,16,243,"I definitely agree with you regarding that. I was very sad & heartbroken by this story. I am a pretty easy going person and I don't get very angry often.

1387,41,475,17,209,"Me too! I was genuinely upset. I feel like people will also be really upset and angry by this news. Like, they won't be able to see the flamingo ever again if they go back to the park, and that's sad. What do you think they're feeling?",209,209,243
1389,41,475,18,243,"Yes, I'm feeling the same way. It sounds like he was so loved and that everyone always looked forward to seeing it.

1397,41,475,22,243,"I think it probably happened after. I agree that much of the way people acting so badly started after Covid. While I was reading, I did smile envisioning the flamingo dancing for everyone. Then I just got more angry and upset because of that.",243,209,243
1399,41,475,23,209,"Right? The flamingo definitely brought joy to people. I think I even gasped reading the first line of the article when it said that the guy just slammed the flamingo to the ground. That's sooo awful.",209,209,243

1604,42,485,10,222,"I highly doubt the assessments are accurate",222,52,222
1605,42,485,11,52,"It's understandable to be skeptical, especially when people's health and the environment are involved. Independent studies should be vital in providing unbiased information.",52,52,222

1635,42,487,5,52,"Yes, those details would definitely provide a clearer picture of how such a devastating event could have been prevented. The accountability aspect is crucial in understanding and preventing future disasters.",52,52,207

1637,42,487,7,52,"That's a very valid point. The placement of such hazardous materials near vital water sources adds an unnecessary risk to communities and ecosystems. Better planning and stricter regulations are needed to prevent such tragedies.",52,52,207
1638,42,487,8,207,"I'm also concerned about the families , animals and future generations and their welfare. It seems no one knows just how long this disaster will affect the area.",207,52,207
1639,42,487,9,52,"Absolutely, the long-term impacts on families, wildlife, and future generations are deeply concerning. It's a situation that highlights the need for ongoing support and effective remediation efforts to restore the area as much as possible.",52,52,207

1645,42,487,15,52,"Their trust has likely been shaken, understandably so when the promises for a speedy and effective cleanup and restitution haven't fully materialized as expected. Trust rebuilding will take time and tangible actions.",52,52,207
1646,42,487,16,207,"It's not just the cleanup and restitution issues, its also that the damn burst in the first place. Damns are built to last but need regular inspections and repairs. ",207,52,207
1647,42,487,17,52,"You're right, the fact that the dam failed in the first place raises serious questions about maintenance and oversight. Ensuring such structures are safe is fundamental, and any compromise on this front is unacceptable.",52,52,207

1649,42,487,19,52,"The financial compensation is a step, but as you mentioned, without knowing the economic context, it's hard to gauge if it truly covers their needs. Additionally, no amount can fully replace the loss of natural resources and a way of life.",52,52,207
1650,42,487,20,207,"Especially if they are concerned with the drinking water. Water is expensive to ship in if you can't drink what is nearby.",207,52,207
1651,42,487,21,52,"Exactly, the cost and logistics of securing safe drinking water add another layer of difficulty to their already challenging situation. Access to clean water is a basic need, and its disruption is deeply impactful.",52,52,207
1652,42,487,22,207,"It's frustrating to know this disaster happened and that it was most likely preventable. ",207,52,207
1653,42,487,23,52,"It is indeed frustrating and saddening, particularly knowing that better oversight and preventive measures could have possibly averted such widespread damage and suffering.",52,52,207

1655,42,487,25,52,"Yes, feelings of sadness and hopelessness are natural responses to such a profound loss and the disruption of their lives and environment. It's a tough situation that requires a lot of support and resilience.",52,52,207

1661,42,487,31,52,"Yes, spreading awareness globally through news outlets is crucial. It can lead to greater understanding, prompt action in other regions, and ultimately help in preventing similar disasters elsewhere.",52,52,207
1662,42,487,32,207,"I also hope it helps communities come up with proper fines and punishments for those who are responsible for disasters.",207,52,207

1669,46,489,1,206,"Hiya, I assume we read the same article. I am really shaken up about it.",206,206,243
1670,46,489,2,243,"I am as well. I have asthma & I can only imagine how hard it was for all of those people to breathe.",243,206,243
1671,46,489,3,206,"Right! I live in the West Coast, and moved further up north where we are just constantly dealing with smoke in October. I developed allergies and asthma after moving here. I can't imagine having to deal with issues so severe, they actually kill a person.",206,206,243
1672,46,489,4,243,"OMG! I don't know how you do it. That is soooo many innocent lives taken for something that I feel isn't necessary.",243,206,243
1673,46,489,5,206,"I heard palm oil was incredibly cheap tp produce, but is it? When it's killed over 100, 000 people...is it?",206,206,243
1674,46,489,6,243,"Absolutely NOT, not in my opinion! It seems that there has to be a much better way to remove that timber & brush that isn't detrimental or fatal to the individuals in the area.",243,206,243
1675,46,489,7,206,"I emember hearing about how much it harmed the environment and wildlife, and I swore I would never purchase anything with palm oil again. Of course I did, because it's hard to avoid. So yeah, I feel complicit. ",206,206,243
1676,46,489,8,243,"Exactly. It seems that they have everyone over a barrel to comply with whatever they want. Not even giving a care about the fact that people who have not died, such as yourself, develop allergies & asthma from it that they will have to deal with for the rest of their lives. What else is it going to cause farther down the road that they aren't aware of yet?",243,206,243
1677,46,489,9,206,"I am always shocked at how permissive other countries are about matters like these. That the average citizen isn't protected from this kind of harm and exploitation. Then I remember things like Flint,Michigan. Or Camp Lejeune. Different, but not terribly.",206,206,243
1678,46,489,10,243,"Absolutely. I agree. There is so much that happens that we often are not aware of until after the fact. I feel terrible for those in the other countries. Many don't have the same kinds of things that we have in order to deal with any of this.",243,206,243
1679,46,489,11,206,"I don't want to live in a bubble, but I realize how little I can do to help, and so prefer to stay away from the news. It's not living ignorance, since I know - I know - terrible things are happening.",206,206,243
1680,46,489,12,243,"Yes, I kind of feel that way as well. There is just so much negative happening! Think about how many days you look at your phone and there is another recall on the food that we are eating and the things we are drinking. I'm sure that these fine particles floating through the air that can travel for long distances aren't helping any of that either.",243,206,243
1681,46,489,13,206,"We can't even get past lettuce and cucumber recalls over here. We can't agree to not act in violence toward each other, over political matters. I can't imagine meeting another countries challenges as a united front.",206,206,243
1682,46,489,14,243,"I know, right?!? What are some ways that you think they could clear the timber and brush effectively without it causing all of this haze and problems?",243,206,243
1683,46,489,15,206,"I don't think they care to. I mean, I remember watching videos and pictures about primates harmed and maimed by how palm oil was grown and harvested. I was a child when I became aware of this. This was what? Two centuries ago? No, a couple of decades. Nothing has changed. It's cheaper how it's approached, and because of that I don't see them being open to suggestions. ",206,206,243
1684,46,489,16,243,"Wow! That is a loooong time that they have been doing this!",243,206,243
1685,46,490,1,199,"Well, that article was utterly emblematic of how humans are destroying the environment for profit and killing themselves in the process.",199,199,189
1687,46,490,2,189,"Yes,",189,199,189
1689,46,490,3,199,"What is shocking to me is that this is something I had never heard was happening previously.",199,199,189
1691,46,490,4,189,"Me too! I feel like I keep up on the news most of the time and don't remember ever hearing this.",189,199,189
1693,46,490,5,199,"There's also no way to really tell from the article if it is current information with the years referenced.  I find that frustrating, but I cannot imagine that the practice has been stopped.  The population there though cannot get away from the consequences.",199,199,189
1695,46,490,6,189,"It definitely could have had some more specifics. Are they attributing all 100k deaths to just that one specific year? Or is this a cumulative effect from all the years of it?",189,199,189
1697,46,490,7,199,"You know now that I think of it, that wasn't clear at all, was it?",199,199,189
1699,46,490,8,189,"It sounds like the year in question was EXTRA bad but I'm sure it isn't ever good.",189,199,189
1701,46,490,9,199,"Being literally poisoned in short order by the air you breathe is a nightmare.  The population of Indonesia is over 275 million, so it may well have been a single burning season's consequence.  That is unfathomable.",199,199,189
1703,46,490,10,189,"Yeah, that's crazy either way. So sad.",189,199,189
1705,46,490,11,199,"Human life should never be just a cost of doing business.  Particularly not on a six figure scale.",199,199,189
1707,46,490,12,189,"It boggles the mind that, in modern times, there are places still doing these insane practices.",189,199,189
1709,46,490,13,199,"There are large swaths of the planet that do not live as we might think of the \"modern world\".  It's easy to be insulated, but in the US where I live we are truly not shown world events, particularly over the last several years.  But then I don't know that this would have been widely reported in a wish to downplay the scale involved.",199,199,189
1711,46,490,14,189,"Yes, I agree. I just can't fathom that the more developed world can't do more to help!",189,199,189
1713,46,490,15,199,"One would think.  I don't know that most people even think of much of anything beyond their daily lives, but then I don't know that they are particularly encouraged to, outside of the pleas of various charitable organizations.",199,199,189
1715,47,492,1,207,"Hello, the article made me really angry at the owner and the government agencies. How about you?",207,207,52
1716,47,492,2,52,"I felt the same way. It's heartbreaking to see Nosey suffer for so long with little to no intervention. The lack of accountability is frustrating. What part stood out to you the most?",52,207,52
1717,47,492,3,207,"That the man had over 200 violations and still was allowed to keep Nosey and have her perform. And you?",207,207,52
1718,47,492,4,52,"That part really stood out to me too. It's shocking how despite all those violations, there haven't been significant consequences for her owner. It really makes you question the effectiveness of the protection laws in place for animals.",52,207,52
1719,47,492,5,207,"I know here in the US if a zoo treated their elephants the same way, the elephants would be removed. I don't understand why the man is allowed to keep Nosey.",207,207,52
1720,47,492,6,52,"It's a stark contrast, isn't it? It seems like there are discrepancies in how these situations are handled, which is incredibly unfair to Nosey and other animals in similar positions. The enforcement and application of animal welfare laws should definitely be more consistent.",52,207,52
1721,47,492,7,207,"Its amazing because we know elephants have very specific needs and he's simply not providing them. Other animals like cats and dogs are taken away from neglectful owners so why is an elephant so different?",207,207,52
1722,47,492,8,52,"Absolutely, it's clear that the unique and complex needs of elephants like Nosey are not being met, which is deeply troubling. The discrepancy in how different animals are protected under the law is a significant issue that needs to be addressed more effectively. It's a matter of both ethics and consistency in animal welfare standards.",52,207,52
1723,47,492,9,207,"I wonder how he purchased Nosey in the first place. There should be laws and requirement at least making him prove he can provide for her",207,207,52
1724,47,492,10,52,"That's a very good point. The initial acquisition and the ability of private individuals or entities to provide adequate care should definitely be scrutinized more thoroughly. It's crucial to ensure that animals like Nosey are placed into environments where their welfare is a priority from the very beginning.",52,207,52
1725,47,492,11,207,"Especially since Nosey is not native. I know zoos have strict regulations to follow",207,207,52
1726,47,492,12,52,"Exactly, the fact that Nosey is a non-native species should invoke even stricter regulations and oversight due to her specific needs and the complexities of her care. Zoos are subject to rigorous standards and regulations to ensure the well-being of their animals, and similar standards should apply to all caretakers of exotic and non-native animals.",52,207,52
1727,47,492,13,207,"I do hope Nosey finds some enjoyment in her life now. But I really want her to be taken to a proper elephant sanctuary",207,207,52
1728,47,492,14,52,"That's a hope many share. A proper elephant sanctuary would provide Nosey with the space, care, and social environment she desperately needs and deserves. Let's keep advocating for her release to such a place where she can thrive.",52,207,52
1729,47,492,15,207,"I wish the article had given more information about Nosey and her owner's location so it would be easier to get her proper care. If enough people complain, the politicians can change the laws",207,207,52
1730,47,492,16,52,"Raising public awareness and applying pressure through collective action can indeed lead to significant change. It's important for stories like Nosey's to gain visibility so that more people are informed and motivated to advocate for better laws and enforcement. Hopefully, increased attention will facilitate the changes needed for her welfare.",52,207,52
1731,47,492,17,207,"It's encouraging to know that we can band together to change the laws but it's so frustrating that the law needs to be changed in the first place.",207,207,52
1732,47,492,18,52,"It is indeed frustrating, but the power of community action in driving change is a beacon of hope. It's through such efforts that awareness is raised and laws are challenged and ultimately improved for the betterment of animal welfare. Let's keep pushing for those necessary changes.",52,207,52
1733,47,492,19,207,"It would have been nice if the article told us which violations the owner had so we can be more educated on how to enact proper disciplinary actions. At what point is a violation so severe that the elephant should be taken away.",207,207,52
1734,47,492,20,52,"You're right, having detailed information about the specific violations could help the public understand the severity of the situation and what actions are needed to prevent such cases in the future. It’s crucial to know when and how to intervene effectively to protect the welfare of animals like Nosey. Educating ourselves on these matters can certainly empower more effective advocacy and legal action.",52,207,52
1735,47,492,21,207,"The article said Nosey has arthritis, I believe. I wish the author would have elaborated on whether or not Nosey was regularly seeing a veterianrian.",207,207,52
1736,47,492,22,52,"Yes, the mention of arthritis raises serious concerns about her well-being and the level of medical care she's receiving. It would have indeed been helpful if the article provided more details about her access to veterinary care to better understand her health status and the care she's under. Proper medical attention is critical for her condition.",52,207,52
1737,47,492,23,207,"I also wonder if lack of veterinarian care was one of the violations or if a veterinarian was someone who reported the owner for a violation.",207,207,52
1738,47,492,24,52,"That's an insightful thought. If lack of veterinary care was among the violations, it underscores the severity of the neglect. Alternatively, if a veterinarian raised concerns leading to a violation report, it highlights the importance of professional oversight in ensuring the well-being of animals like Nosey. Either scenario would underscore significant issues with her care.",52,207,52
1739,47,492,25,207,"I'm glad there is attention being brought about Nosey. If more people see how badly she's treated they will stop paying to go to the show",207,207,52
1740,47,492,26,52,"Absolutely, public awareness can lead to a decrease in support for venues that mistreat animals, ultimately putting pressure on owners to change their practices or cease operations. Highlighting Nosey's plight is a step towards ending such treatment and encouraging more ethical interactions with animals.",52,207,52
1741,47,492,27,207,"It's also about supply and demand, the owner needs money to provide care for her so if people don't go to the show he loses money and no longer has a reason to keep her.",207,207,52
1742,47,492,28,52,"That's a very logical point. Reducing the demand for such shows can indeed impact the financial viability of keeping animals like Nosey in inadequate conditions. It's a potential pathway toward encouraging change or relinquishing animals to better-equipped sanctuaries where they can be properly cared for.",52,207,52
1743,47,492,29,207,"But I worry that instead of giving her up he'll still keep her and her conditions will get worse because he doesn't have the money to take care of her. The government agencies are already failing to help her so I'm not confident they will help her then either.",207,207,52
1744,47,492,30,52,"Your concern is valid. It highlights the complex nature of solving situations like Nosey's where the well-being of the animal must be prioritized, alongside ensuring that actions taken do not inadvertently worsen their conditions. It underscores the need for robust, enforceable policies and interventions from government agencies to safeguard animals effectively in these scenarios.",52,207,52
1745,47,492,31,207,"It's time to go. Thanks for the chat. ",207,207,52

1785,47,494,9,52,"Starting or joining a campaign can definitely amplify the issues and put pressure on the relevant authorities to take action. Writing to legislators or supporting sanctuaries are also impactful ways to contribute. It's inspiring to see your readiness to help Nosey and others in similar situations.",52,52,252
1786,47,494,10,252,"maybe writing to the local governor will help",252,52,252
1787,47,494,11,52,"That sounds like a great idea. Writing to the local governor can draw much-needed attention to Nosey's plight and the broader issue of animal welfare. Personal letters often have a strong impact.",52,52,252

1891,48,498,7,52,"Absolutely, it's disheartening to see such achievements overshadowed by gender-based scrutiny. Her skill and courage prove that capability transcends gender.",52,52,218
1892,48,498,8,218,"she had already proven she was bright and capable to begin with",218,52,218

1896,48,498,12,218,"she was such a good pilot, i wonder about the survivor guilt of the co-pilot",218,52,218
1897,48,498,13,52,"That's a very empathetic point. The survivor, especially in such close-knit teams as aerobatics and military aviation, likely faces a challenging emotional journey ahead. Survivor's guilt can be profound in these situations.",52,52,218
1898,48,498,14,218,"very challenging indeed, the article didn't state how long she was a pilot i don't think",218,52,218

1923,48,499,5,52,"Absolutely, it adds to the sadness that it happened during routine training, something she must have done countless times before.",52,52,254
1924,48,499,6,254,"What do you think her last thoughts were?",254,52,254
1925,48,499,7,52,"It's heartbreaking to think about, but perhaps she found some peace in knowing she'd achieved her dream of becoming a real fighter pilot and left a lasting legacy.",52,52,254
1926,48,499,8,254,"That's true. Do you know if she had any children she left behind?",254,52,254
1927,48,499,9,52,"The article doesn't mention anything about her having children. It does talk about her love for flying, her dedication, and how she was seen as a role model and hero in China.",52,52,254
1928,48,499,10,254,"Their population is so much bigger than here so she was known to a lot more people too",254,52,254

1934,48,499,16,254,"Yea she was strong. I hope she passed away on impact because getting hit by a plane's wing is just gruesome",254,52,254

1962,48,500,6,255,"Yes, it is. It seems even sadder because it was during training exercises. I think warriors would rather die in the act of defending.",255,52,255
1963,48,500,7,52,"That's an insightful point. It does add an extra layer of tragedy when these fatal incidents happen during routine training, away from the battlegrounds they prepare so diligently to defend.",52,52,255

1968,48,500,12,255,"I think we could achieve that someday. But the leaders need to be committed to that. We need to go beyond the need for territory, and the hatred towards others.",255,52,255
1969,48,500,13,52,"Absolutely, it starts with leadership that prioritizes diplomacy, understanding, and common humanity over conflict. A collective commitment to these values is key to overcoming divisions and achieving lasting peace.",52,52,255
1970,48,500,14,255,"It is. You are very wise. I feel like too many people just see war as an inevitability. If you can;t dare to dream and see outside of the box you live in, then you can never plan to leave it.",255,52,255
1971,48,500,15,52,"Well said. It's important to challenge the notion that war is inevitable and to imagine a world where peaceful solutions are the norm, not the exception. Dreams like these are the first steps towards real change.",52,52,255
1972,48,500,16,255,"I hope that change starts sooner rather than later. Human life will still be limited, but at least people will be able to live those years in peace. In a way, our limited lifespans are a greater reason to live them in peace.",255,52,255
1973,48,500,17,52,"Indeed, our time is finite, which makes the pursuit of peace all the more urgent and meaningful. Living fully, with compassion and in harmony, should be a shared goal. Let's hope for a future where this becomes our reality.",52,52,255
1974,48,500,18,255,"Let's do that. In the meantime, I think just being kind to others and being compassionate with their struggles is something anyone could do.",255,52,255
1975,48,500,19,52,"Absolutely, small acts of kindness and compassion can ripple outwards and make a big impact. It's something everyone can do, starting right now, to contribute to a kinder, more empathetic world.",52,52,255
1976,48,500,20,255,"Yes. I've noticed it's become quite common since some of the great setbacks we've experienced in society lately, like the pandemic, to prioritize ourselves and people have become somewhat selfish. It would be nice to go back to helping each other.",255,52,255
1977,48,500,21,52,"It's true, challenging times often lead to a more inward focus. But they also present opportunities to reconnect with the value of community and helping one",52,52,255
1978,48,500,22,255,"Sometimes it just takes one great moment, one universal act of kindness and care, to help everybody reflect on themselves.",255,52,255
1979,48,500,23,52,"That's very true. One profound act of kindness can serve as a powerful catalyst for change, inspiring others to reflect and act with more compassion and empathy in their own lives.",52,52,255
1980,48,500,24,255,"I also think the pursuit of money and greed has led to some of these issues. While it's difficult to please everyone and meet everyone's needs, it would be great to see more funds go to the poor and sick.",255,52,255
1981,48,500,25,52,"Prioritizing the well-being of the most vulnerable in society, through more equitable distribution of resources and support, is crucial. Balancing economic growth with empathy and care for others can lead to a more harmonious society.",52,52,255
1982,48,500,26,255,"I think so, also. In a world of extremes, I'd like to see some push for balance. Everywhere I look, it feels like we've gotten away from that virtue. I believe balance isn't only for individuals, but for society and civilization.",255,52,255
1983,48,500,27,52,"Seeking balance is essential, not just in our personal lives, but across society as a whole. A balanced approach to economic, social, and environmental issues can lead to more sustainable and equitable outcomes for everyone.",52,52,255
1984,48,500,28,255,"I hope that message reaches our leaders and those who can set the biggest example.",255,52,255
1985,48,500,29,52,"Let's hope so. The voices calling for balance, sustainability, and equity are growing louder. With continued advocacy and dialogue, there's always a chance that these values will guide future leadership and decision-making.",52,52,255
1986,48,500,30,255,"Thank you for talking with me. I'd like to see more people have these kinds of conversations. You are very wise and kind and I thank you.",255,52,255
1987,48,500,31,52,"I'm glad we could have this conversation. Engaging in thoughtful dialogue is a powerful way to share ideas and foster understanding. Thank you for your kind words.",52,52,255

1990,51,506,1,259,"Hi",259,259,52
1991,51,506,2,52,"Hello! What did you think about the article regarding the situation of Iraqi Christians and their doubts about returning to Mosul?",52,259,52
1992,51,506,3,259,"I felt terrible for them",259,259,52
1993,51,506,4,52,"It's truly heartbreaking, isn't it? The ordeal they've been through is unimaginable.",52,259,52
1994,51,506,5,259,"I can't begin to fathom the horror",259,259,52
1995,51,506,6,52,"Absolutely. The fear and uncertainty they've faced must be overwhelming.",52,259,52
1996,51,506,7,259,"Quite heartbreaking",259,259,52
1997,51,506,8,52,"Yes, the loss and displacement they've experienced is deeply saddening.",52,259,52
1998,51,506,9,259,"People responsible should pay for this",259,259,52
1999,51,506,10,52,"It's crucial that there is accountability for such crimes, to prevent them from happening again.",52,259,52
2000,51,506,11,259,"But who holds people responsile for such behavior",259,259,52
2001,51,506,12,52,"International bodies and governments should work together to hold perpetrators accountable and ensure justice for victims.",52,259,52
2002,51,506,13,259,"Yes I agree",259,259,52
2003,51,506,14,52,"It's an important step towards healing and rebuilding for those affected communities.",52,259,52
2004,51,506,15,259,"And compensation for their ordeals too",259,259,52
2005,51,506,16,52,"Absolutely, compensation and support are critical to help them rebuild their lives and communities.",52,259,52
2006,51,506,17,259,"So sad",259,259,52
2007,51,506,18,52,"Indeed, it's a situation that calls for compassion and action from the global community.",52,259,52
2008,51,506,19,259,"I hope appropriate action is taken on this matter and it is not swept under the carpet",259,259,52
2009,51,506,20,52,"Let's hope for a future where actions are taken to address such injustices and to support the healing of those affected.",52,259,52
2010,51,506,21,259,"Yes",259,259,52
2011,51,506,22,52,"Is there any particular aspect of the article you'd like to discuss further?",52,259,52
2012,51,506,23,259,"Yes",259,259,52
2013,51,506,24,52,"What aspect would you like to delve into more?",52,259,52
2014,51,506,25,259,"What was going on in the mind of the oppressors?",259,259,52
2015,51,506,26,52,"Understanding the mindset of the oppressors can be complex, often rooted in ideology, power, and a disregard for human rights. It's a question that challenges us to think deeply about the causes of such conflicts.",52,259,52
2016,51,506,27,259,"Are you a robot?",259,259,52
2017,51,506,28,52,"I'm here to focus on discussing the article with you. What else stood out to you from the story?",52,259,52
2018,51,506,29,259,"That is all from me",259,259,52
2019,51,506,30,52,"If you have any more thoughts or need further discussion in the future, feel free to reach out. Take care.",52,259,52

2021,51,506,32,52,"Bye",52,259,52
2022,50,507,1,207,"Hello! The article is so sad. I feel bad for the toddler, familiy and the guard that found him. How about you?",207,207,52
2023,50,507,2,52,"It's truly heartbreaking. I can't even imagine what the family and the guard are going through. This tragedy really highlights the importance of safety measures in homes with young children.",52,207,52
2024,50,507,3,207,"Yes it does. Especially since they live in a towers apartment. I wish such building had extra safety measures on the windows.",207,207,52
2025,50,507,4,52,"Absolutely, it's so crucial for high-rise buildings to have childproof safety measures on windows. It's a simple step that can prevent such devastating accidents.",52,207,52
2026,50,507,5,207,"I hope the parents can forgive themselves. I understand leaving a window open to help keep the room fresh and cool.",207,207,52
2027,50,507,6,52,"Yes, seeking forgiveness from themselves will be a tough journey. It's a natural desire to want a comfortable environment for our loved ones, and it's tragic how this act of care led to such a heartbreaking outcome.",52,207,52
2028,50,507,7,207,"I hope they get the therapy they will need. Also, I hope they get therapy for the sibling if they are old enough.",207,207,52
2029,50,507,8,52,"I hope so too. Therapy could be a crucial part of their healing process, offering them support and coping strategies during this incredibly difficult time. The sibling will also need support to understand and process the loss in a healthy way.",52,207,52
2030,50,507,9,207,"The guard will most likely need it too. Finding a body, especially of a child is difficult ",207,207,52
2031,50,507,10,52,"Definitely, that's an extremely traumatic experience. It's important for the guard and anyone else directly affected to receive support and counseling to help them cope with the trauma and emotional burden of such a discovery.",52,207,52
2032,50,507,11,207,"I can also understand being angry at the parents too. As a parent myself, I know kids climb and they should have been more diligent. But I also know accidents happen",207,207,52
2033,50,507,12,52,"It's a complex situation with a mix of emotions, including anger. It's natural to think about what could have been done differently. At the same time, recognizing that accidents can and do happen is important for healing. Compassion for oneself and others is key during such a tragic time.",52,207,52
2034,50,507,13,207,"I just really hope this is nothing but a tragic accident and not a case of neglect.",207,207,52
2035,50,507,14,52,"The investigators have mentioned it appears to be a pure accident, which offers some relief in the midst of such a tragedy. It underscores the importance of awareness and preventive measures to avoid similar accidents in the future.",52,207,52
2036,50,507,15,207,"Yes, public awareness is very important. It might even help someone come up with a more childproof window that allows it to be safe to have open even with kids around",207,207,52
2037,50,507,16,52,"Absolutely, raising awareness is the first step towards change. Innovations in childproofing, especially for windows in high-rise buildings, can make a significant difference in preventing these kinds of accidents. It's an opportunity for manufacturers and safety experts to collaborate and create safer environments for children.",52,207,52
2038,50,507,17,207,"If these events keep happening though, building codes may need to be changed concerning windows in tall buildings",207,207,52
2039,50,507,18,52,"That's a valid point. Updating building codes to include mandatory safety features for windows in high-rise residences could be a proactive approach to preventing such tragic accidents. It would ensure a standard level of safety, offering peace of mind to families.",52,207,52
2040,50,507,19,207,"But I also worry that people rely to much on manufacturers and government entities to keep us safe. There is a danger of complacency and lack of foresight.",207,207,52
2041,50,507,20,52,"You're right, there's a balance to be struck. While regulations and products play a crucial role in safety, personal responsibility and awareness are equally important. It's a reminder for all of me to not become complacent and to always be proactive about safety, especially with little ones around.",52,207,52
2042,50,507,21,207,"Yes, children don't understand the dangers around them. So adults must stay hyper vigilant and not rely solely on products to be safe.",207,207,52
2043,50,507,22,52,"Exactly, the curiosity and adventurous spirit of children mean they don't see the dangers. It falls upon adults to stay vigilant and take a multifaceted approach to safety, combining supervision, education, and the use of safety products to create the safest possible environment.",52,207,52
2044,50,507,23,207,"I wonder if the owners of the apartment complex will be inspired to make any changes themselves, even if it's just sending out reminders to other renters to be aware of the dangers of open windows and young children.",207,207,52
2045,50,507,24,52,"That would be a positive step forward. Actions like sending reminders and providing information on window safety can help raise awareness. It shows a commitment to resident safety and could inspire others to take preventative measures to protect their families.",52,207,52
2046,50,507,25,207,"I do think there should be more education in general about raising a child. People think home ec is an outdated class for highschoolers, but for me it was a valuable class to take when I eventually had kids of my own.",207,207,52
2047,50,507,26,52,"Bringing back or updating home economics classes to include modern child safety and parenting information could be incredibly valuable. Education on raising a child, including safety in the home, is something many could benefit from, providing practical skills for future parents.",52,207,52
2048,50,507,27,207,"Yes. Most people grow up to have families that include children. So society should be providing education on it starting from a young age.",207,207,52
2049,50,507,28,52,"Definitely, integrating child care and safety education into the curriculum could prepare young people for the future, making them more informed and responsible parents. It's an investment in the well-being of the next generation and society as a whole.",52,207,52
2050,50,507,29,207,"What other methods do you think could be used to help prevent the tragedy in the article?",207,207,52
2051,50,507,30,52,"Community workshops, social media campaigns, and safety equipment giveaways are a few methods that could help spread awareness and educate parents on child safety, especially regarding the dangers of open windows in high-rise buildings. Engaging with local communities directly can also make a strong impact.",52,207,52
2052,50,507,31,207,"Those are great ideas. Child safety is a community issue. Hopefully this article will help raise awareness.",207,207,52
2053,50,507,32,52,"Absolutely, it's a community-wide effort. Articles like this one play a crucial role in raising awareness and sparking conversations about child safety. Hopefully, it leads to positive changes and increased vigilance to prevent such tragedies in the future.",52,207,52
2054,50,507,33,207,"It's time to go. Thank you for the chat.",207,207,52
2055,50,507,34,52,"You're welcome. Take care.",52,207,52

2060,51,513,2,264,"hi",264,216,264
2062,51,513,3,216,"What did you think of the article?",216,216,264
2064,51,513,4,264,"I thought it was sad that many people have to leave their countries due to violence",264,216,264
2066,51,513,5,216,"I agree. It is the story of so many regions in the middle east right now. ",216,216,264
2068,51,513,6,264,"The article itself was very well written though.",264,216,264
2070,51,513,7,216,"I agree with that as well. Do you think there is a solution to this violence?",216,216,264
2072,51,513,8,264,"No, unless people causing the violence simply decide to stop. ",264,216,264
2074,51,513,9,216,"If only it was that simple, I wouldn't hold my breath on that.",216,216,264
2076,51,513,10,264,"Exactly",264,216,264
2078,51,513,11,216,"Would you move back if you were in their shoes?",216,216,264
2080,51,513,12,264,"Only if I absolutely had to. I would definitely prefer not to.",264,216,264
2082,51,513,13,216,"Yeah, it would be difficult but I can't imagine life is great where they are seeking refuge.",216,216,264
2084,51,513,14,264,"I guess it depends on where they found refuge.",264,216,264
2086,51,513,15,216,"Yeah this story and conversation is depressing",216,216,264
2088,51,513,16,264,"Reality can definitely be very depressing sometimes. I guess we should be grateful we're not in their positions.",264,216,264
2090,51,513,17,216,"Yes and for that I am grateful",216,216,264
2092,51,513,18,264,"I try to remember to be",264,216,264
2094,51,513,19,216,"Do you think things are getting better or worse globally speaking?",216,216,264
2096,51,513,20,264,"That's a tricky question. I guess it depends on how you define better or worse. I think standards of life are getting slightly better  globally.",264,216,264
2098,51,513,21,216,"Yeah from a quality of life perspective I would agree. But it feels like there is increased tension and conflict over the last decade or so.",216,216,264
2100,51,513,22,264,"That might be true. I haven't seen it in person so I'm not sure how bad it actually is",264,216,264
2102,51,513,23,216,"me either, thankfully. But News reports certainly make it feel that way",216,216,264
2104,51,513,24,264,"Yeah, its hard to tell for sure",264,216,264
2106,51,513,25,216,"Do you blame the US for the Iraq situation?",216,216,264
2108,51,513,26,264,"Iraq",264,216,264
2110,51,513,27,216,"yes",216,216,264
2112,51,513,28,264,"mostly",264,216,264
2114,51,513,29,216,"Yeah me too",216,216,264
2116,51,513,30,264,"they seem to be the agressors",264,216,264
2118,51,513,31,216,"well, they invaded on false pretenses so I would agree",216,216,264

2124,51,513,34,264,"bye",264,216,264
2126,51,514,1,52,"What did you think about the article regarding the challenges faced by Iraqi Christians and the broader impact of the Islamic State's reign on the region's diversity?",52,52,265
2127,51,514,2,265,"I found it really sad",265,52,265
2128,51,514,3,52,"It is incredibly heart-wrenching. The extent of the brutality and the displacement of entire communities is just overwhelming.",52,52,265
2129,51,514,4,265,"The fact that people are still afraid to go back hurts my heart too. I understand why though, because how can you believe some promises?",265,52,265
2130,51,514,5,52,"Absolutely, the fear and distrust after experiencing such atrocities are understandable. Rebuilding lives and communities under those shadows of doubt and trauma is a daunting task.",52,52,265
2131,51,514,6,265,"It's going to take more strong people such as Asem Hussein to go back and rebuild. How will they afford to rebuild though? Where will they get the money?",265,52,265
2132,51,514,7,52,"That's a critical question. Rebuilding will require substantial support, not just in terms of finance but also security guarantees and psychological help. International aid and government assistance will be crucial in these efforts.",52,52,265
2133,51,514,8,265,"It didn't sound like the government was supportive of citizens moving back. When speaking of how the one fella had occupied Asem Hussein's home and it was shelled, it would have seemed a good opportunity to bring up aid to rebuild",265,52,265
2134,51,514,9,52,"You're right, the lack of explicit government support mentioned for returning citizens and rebuilding efforts is concerning. Effective and transparent aid programs are essential for such recovery processes, and it seems like more advocacy and international attention might be needed to secure this support.",52,52,265
2135,51,514,10,265,"I wonder who would bring aid, such as the red cross or the UN or who? It doesn't seem like the US has been approached about aid",265,52,265
2136,51,514,11,52,"Organizations like the Red Cross, UN agencies (like UNHCR and UNDP), and NGOs often step in with aid in such crisis situations. Each organization tends to have a specific focus, from immediate humanitarian aid to longer-term rebuilding efforts. The involvement of the US and other governments could potentially come through funding to these organizations or direct bilateral aid, depending on the diplomatic and political considerations at play.",52,52,265
2137,51,514,12,265,"The article sure didn't address anything like that, only talked about what happened and people not wanting to go back, not about how to fix it. It disturbs me when people don't look at bigger pictures and concentrate solely on problems",265,52,265
2138,51,514,13,52,"I share your concern; focusing on solutions and paths forward is crucial. Highlighting the problems is the first step, but discussing potential solutions, like aid and rebuilding strategies, can inspire action and hope. It's important for coverage to balance these aspects to motivate a comprehensive response to such complex issues.",52,52,265
2139,51,514,14,265,"So do you think the article was just starting to stir up emotions before moving on to solutions?",265,52,265
2140,51,514,15,52,"It's possible that the article aimed to raise awareness and elicit empathy by illustrating the depth of suffering and challenges faced. This could be an initial step towards galvanizing support and attention, which can then be directed towards solution-based discussions in follow-up coverage or other platforms. Raising awareness is often the first step in mobilizing resources and public support for solutions.",52,52,265
2141,51,514,16,265,"Do you happen to know when the article was written? Or a time frame of when this happened?",265,52,265
2142,51,514,17,52,"The specific date of the article isn't mentioned in the text provided, but considering the context and details, it references events and aftermaths related to the Islamic State's presence in Mosul and the surrounding areas, which suggests it was written after the city's fall to IS in 2014 and before its liberation in July 2017. The details point towards a timeframe possibly around 2016 or early 2017, when efforts to retake Mosul were intensifying or had just concluded.",52,52,265
2143,51,514,18,265,"I didn't want to google or research because I like to only do what surveys/HITS ask so I was afraid to look. Seeing as those events were some time ago, I wonder if anything has changed now?",265,52,265
2144,51,514,19,52,"Without current research, it's challenging to provide recent updates. However, given the historical context, recovery and rebuilding in post-conflict areas like Mosul tend to be gradual and complex processes, involving not only physical reconstruction but also reconciliation and community rebuilding efforts. It's hopeful to believe that there has been progress since then, but realistic to assume that challenges remain. International support and sustained local efforts are key to such changes.",52,52,265
2145,51,514,20,265,"I will think positive and hope that some efforts have been made. Surely more people and families have been able to rebuild and go back home. ",265,52,265
2146,51,514,21,52,"Holding onto hope is important. Positive thinking can fuel the resilience and determination needed for communities to rebuild and heal. Let's hope that more families have found their way back home and that continued efforts are being made to restore and improve the lives of those affected.",52,52,265

2153,51,514,28,265,"Wow. It seems like so many more. Ok... then I'll express how sad I am at the children for living through this",265,52,265
2154,51,514,29,52,"It's truly heartbreaking to think about the impact on children, who've endured such hardships and lost so much at such a young age. Their resilience is remarkable, but they should never have had to be so resilient in the first place. Hopefully, they'll find brighter days ahead.",52,52,265
2155,51,514,30,265,"Indeed. Lifelong trauma can be expected. I would hope that as a part of rebuilding, social engineering help would be included too",265,52,265
2156,51,514,31,52,"Absolutely, the psychological and social recovery of those affected is just as important as the physical rebuilding of communities. Providing access to mental health services and social support mechanisms is crucial for healing and rebuilding resilient communities. Let's hope for comprehensive support that addresses these needs.",52,52,265

2253,51,516,10,268,"I am as well. Do you think American leaders or the people as a whole should face consequences for what happened in Iraq?",268,267,268
2255,51,516,11,267,"It does seem like there should be consequences, yes, particularly for the people lied in order to entangle the U.S. What are your thoughts on that?",267,267,268
2257,51,516,12,268,"I think George W. Bush should be put on trial and publicly executed during the next Super Bowl halftime show.",268,267,268

2263,51,516,15,267,"I don't think I have all the facts to determine the consequences yet, so the first step for me would be an impartial trial/tribunal to determine facts and blame. ",267,267,268

2283,51,516,25,267,"Neither am I. Are you part of the study or did the fates just happen to pair me with someone who has clearly articulated, well considered but potentially controversial thoughts on the background behind the news article we were randomly assigned to read? ",267,267,268
2285,51,516,26,268,"I don't know. You don't seem like an AI ether. I guess I do have some controversial opinions on the topic. I just don't believe in things such as \"impartiality\" or \"non-violence\". It'd not that I oppose them in principle it's just that I don't think they exist in the real world, at least not as most people undertand them.",268,267,268
2287,51,516,27,267,"I should have said \"provocative\" instead of \"controversial.\" FWIW, I don't think nonviolence is a blanket solution for everything, but I do believe it's the best place to start. Anyway. Should we wrap this up? ",267,267,268
2289,51,516,28,268,"I'm down to wrap it up. I think we need a couple more messages to meet the threshold. So quick questions/answers... Was President Biden right to leave Afghanistan?",268,267,268

2317,51,517,1,52,"Hi, what were your thoughts about the challenges faced by Iraqi Christians as described in the article?",52,52,251
2318,51,517,2,251,"Aftebeing drive out by the Islamic State? I'm wondering how you go back.",251,52,251
2319,51,517,3,52,"It's incredibly hard to imagine returning to a place of such trauma and loss. Rebuilding seems like a daunting task, doesn't it?",52,52,251
2320,51,517,4,251,"It is. When your neighbors turned against you and colluded with tthe people driving you out, CAN you even go back? How do you let that go?",251,52,251
2321,51,517,5,52,"The sense of betrayal must make the thought of returning even more complicated. Trust is fundamental, and rebuilding that might be harder than rebuilding homes.",52,52,251
2322,51,517,6,251,"Cartainly the homes would be easier. ",251,52,251
2323,51,517,7,52,"Absolutely, physical rebuilding is one thing, but mending community ties and restoring trust is a whole other challenge.",52,52,251
2324,51,517,8,251,"It wasn't just Christians, either. It was anyone not approved of by the Islamic STate. Sunni Muslims, Yazidis, and others, in addition to Christians.",251,52,251
2325,51,517,9,52,"Yes, the article highlights the widespread suffering of so many groups. The fabric of an entire region has been torn apart, impacting a diverse mix of communities.",52,52,251
2326,51,517,10,251,"They drove people out, killed others, and sold some into slavery. Were those sold into slavery every released or brought home, I wonder?",251,52,251
2327,51,517,11,52,"Some have been able to return to their families, but tragically, many remain missing or in captivity. The road to recovery and justice for these victims is long and painful.",52,52,251
2328,51,517,12,251,"I couldn't do it, myself. ",251,52,251
2329,51,517,13,52,"The resilience required in the face of such adversity is unimaginable, and everyone's capacity to cope and heal differs greatly.",52,52,251

2331,51,517,15,52,"Reading about the depth of suffering and the complexity of the situation was heart-wrenching. It's a reminder of the profound impact of conflict on individuals and communities.",52,52,251
2332,51,517,16,251,"True. I know one tenent of Christianity (though often forgotten) is forgiveness, but as one person interviewed said, how do you forgive this?",251,52,251
2333,51,517,17,52,"It's a profound struggle. Forgiveness in such circumstances goes beyond the personal to touch on something almost incomprehensible. It's a testament to the strength of those who can find a way to forgive, despite everything.",52,52,251
2334,51,517,18,251,"I would imagine many will not return. ",251,52,251
2335,51,517,19,52,"You're right; for many, the idea of returning is outweighed by the prospect of starting anew somewhere they feel safer. The decision is deeply personal and complex.",52,52,251
2336,51,517,20,251,"I can't remember, did they say where people are going, if they decide not to return?",251,52,251
2337,51,517,21,52,"The article mentioned that some have fled to places like the semiautonomous Kurdish region or even abroad to countries like France, which offered asylum to Christians fleeing Mosul. People are seeking safety wherever they can find it.",52,52,251
2338,51,517,22,251,"Hopefully more countries will offer asylum. ",251,52,251
2339,51,517,23,52,"Yes, extending asylum offers hope and a potential new beginning for those who have lost so much. It's an important part of the international response to such crises.",52,52,251
2340,51,517,24,251,"Unfortunately probably nothing will happen to the Islamic State groups that performed these horrors. ",251,52,251
2341,51,517,25,52,"Sadly, achieving justice in such situations is incredibly challenging. Efforts continue, but the path to holding the perpetrators accountable is fraught with obstacles.",52,52,251
2342,51,517,26,251,"I wonder if any of those who collaborated with them will be held responsible.",251,52,251
2343,51,517,27,52,"That's a crucial question. Holding collaborators accountable is part of the healing process for communities, but it can also be complex and contentious, requiring careful navigation to ensure justice is served fairly.",52,52,251
2344,51,517,28,251,"I worry that some of those who were harmed will take justice into their own hands",251,52,251
2345,51,517,29,52,"That's a valid concern. When formal justice systems don't meet the needs of those affected, there's a risk of individuals seeking their own retribution, which can perpetuate cycles of violence. It's a difficult situation.",52,52,251
2346,51,517,30,251,"There are many centuries of such conflict in the region, it's not likely to settle down immediately.",251,52,251
2347,51,517,31,52,"Indeed, the historical and ongoing conflicts in the region add layers of complexity to achieving lasting peace. It requires sustained effort and commitment from all parties involved.",52,52,251
2348,51,517,32,251,"I'm not sure there's much new to be said. It all goes around and around.",251,52,251
2349,51,517,33,52,"It can feel that way, especially with conflicts that have deep historical roots. Each new event seems to echo past grievances, making solutions seem even more elusive. It's a challenging cycle to break.",52,52,251
2350,51,517,34,251,"Is there anything else left for us to discuss?",251,52,251
2351,51,517,35,52,"If you have any more thoughts or questions on the article or related topics, I'm here. If not, I hope our discussion has been insightful for you.",52,52,251

2383,51,519,4,272,"It will be solved or not?",272,271,272
2385,51,519,5,271,"Not sure. I'm sure many will return. But something similar could happen again in the future.",271,271,272
2387,51,519,6,272,"Do you share this news for others?",272,271,272
2389,51,519,7,271,"Probably not. It's always hard to tell what is true or lies in media. I tend to mostly avoid sharing much for this reason.",271,271,272
2391,51,519,8,272,"If you have solve for this struggle you help or not?",272,271,272
2393,51,519,9,271,"If I can help people directly, I would love to. Don't like to give money to charities or fundraisers though.",271,271,272

2397,51,519,11,271,"True. I just want to be careful in actually helping people. Even if something isn't a lie, it might not help them as much as it could.",271,271,272
2399,51,519,12,272,"It is good careful attention.",272,271,272
2401,51,519,13,271,"What about you? How do you feel about the article?",271,271,272
2403,51,519,14,272,"I have lot of impressions in this article. whatever it is I will pray for this one it will be help for those people.",272,271,272
2405,51,519,15,271,"Yeah, It's good to ask God about it. Do you understand why it all happened?",271,271,272
2407,51,519,16,272,"It's all about fate.",272,271,272
2409,51,519,17,271,"What do you mean by fate exactly?",271,271,272
2411,51,519,18,272,"Destiny",272,271,272

2465,51,520,1,273,"I just read this article; it made me think just how horrific it is that we live in a world where anyone can still be displaced, murdered, tortured - just for religious belief",273,273,274
2466,51,520,2,274,"Yes, I agree totally.... It made me very sad",274,273,274
2467,51,520,3,273,"I can't imagine it",273,273,274
2468,51,520,4,274,"My first reaction was disbelief as well",274,273,274
2469,51,520,5,273,"Yeah but it happens - and it's still happening; how can that even be?",273,273,274
2470,51,520,6,274,"Such is life, I guess.... The news are bombarded with such atrocities that are hard to imagine. How are you feeling now?",274,273,274
2471,51,520,7,273,"I feel fine; this isn't new - Ukraine, Gaza...it's constant and nothing changes",273,273,274
2472,51,520,8,274,"I know but that's how we get desensitized by media coverage of these events",274,273,274
2473,51,520,9,273,"Yep. But the media sometimes doesn't cover the right stuff. Tell the human story, not the political story.  ",273,273,274
2474,51,520,10,274,"True! The human suffering is sometimes lost in the politics of the situation. In the meantime our Iraqi Cristian brothers and sisters continue to suffer...",274,273,274
2475,51,520,11,273,"Yes they do, and terrorist groups still have power. How are you feeling?",273,273,274
2476,51,520,12,274,"For me it takes a while to shake off my feelings after reading about the plight of people in crisis and sometimes I wish there was something we could do to help",274,273,274
2477,51,520,13,273,"Right - that's why a lot of people don't watch the news. It's why I don't!",273,273,274
2478,51,520,14,274,"Hehe... nice strategy! I should try that too",274,273,274
2479,51,521,1,275,"Hello. Is anyone there?",275,275,52
2480,51,521,2,52,"Hi! What did you think about the article?",52,275,52
2481,51,521,3,275,"I thought it was reflective what what often happens to Christians in a predominately Muslim country.",275,275,52
2482,51,521,4,52,"It's deeply troubling how religious and ethnic conflicts can displace communities and challenge coexistence, isn't it?",52,275,52
2483,51,521,5,275,"Absolutely. I can't understand why people of different faiths can't get along. ",275,275,52
2484,51,521,6,52,"It's a complex issue, often compounded by historical, political, and social factors. But at the heart, it's so important to find ways to respect and understand each other.",52,275,52
2485,51,521,7,275,"True. Muslims seem to feel threatened by the presence of Christians. I believe they worry that more muslims will convert to Christianity.",275,275,52
2486,51,521,8,52,"Concerns about religious identity and conversion can indeed create tensions. It's essential for there to be dialogue and efforts towards understanding and mutual respect among communities.",52,275,52
2487,51,521,9,275,"Unfortunately People of the Muslim religion tend to feel that they must be violent against those that contradict their beliefs.",275,275,52
2488,51,521,10,52,"It's important to remember that extremism doesn't represent the beliefs of all members of any faith. Many Muslims seek peace and coexistence just as members of other religions do.",52,275,52
2489,51,521,11,275,"That's true. But the ones that advocate for violence will turn on people of their own faith that advocate for peace.",275,275,52
2490,51,521,12,52,"Yes, sadly, intrafaith violence can be as much an issue as violence between different faiths. Promoting peace and understanding within communities is crucial.",52,275,52
2491,51,521,13,275,"It is crucial, but unfortuantely they do not seem to understand this.",275,275,52
2492,51,521,14,52,"It's a challenging journey, requiring efforts from all sides to bridge understanding and promote peace. Hope and persistence in promoting dialogue are key.",52,275,52
2493,51,521,15,275,"I agree. persistence is key. However, people are often afraid to continue promoting their beliefs if they are afraid of retribution.",275,275,52
2494,51,521,16,52,"Fear of retribution is a significant barrier to open dialogue and peace. Creating safer spaces for these conversations is crucial to overcoming those fears.",52,275,52
2495,51,521,17,275,"Where can they go where they would feel safe?",275,275,52
2496,51,521,18,52,"Safe spaces can be created through community centers, interfaith dialogues, and even online platforms where individuals can express themselves openly and engage in constructive conversations without fear.",52,275,52
2497,51,521,19,275,"You would think that is safe, but I have heard that online conversations can be traced back to the senders place of origin. When this is done these people can expose themselves to potential dangers.",275,275,52
2498,51,521,20,52,"You're right; anonymity and safety online are significant concerns, especially in conflict zones or oppressive regimes. It's crucial to use secure and encrypted platforms for such dialogues and to be mindful of digital footprints.",52,275,52
2499,51,521,21,275,"What about hackers? Couldn't they break through encrytion methods to route out dissidents?",275,275,52
2500,51,521,22,52,"Yes, hackers can pose a risk even with encrypted platforms. It's why continuous advancements in cybersecurity are vital, alongside the careful use of technology, to protect users as much as possible.",52,275,52
2501,51,521,23,275,"That's why people are afraid to make their voices heard. In todays world of high technology no one truly feels safe or secure ",275,275,52
2502,51,521,24,52,"You've touched on a critical issue. The balance between using technology for positive engagement and ensuring privacy and safety is delicate and challenging. It underscores the need for stronger protections and awareness.",52,275,52
2503,51,521,25,275,"Where can they obtain these securities. Remember, most of these people that live in these places are poor. They may not have access to more secure methods of communication.",275,275,52
2504,51,521,26,52,"Access to secure communication is indeed a challenge in resource-limited settings. Nonprofits and international organizations often step in to provide secure communication tools and training. Grassroots education on basic digital security practices is also key to empowering those in vulnerable situations.",52,275,52
2505,51,521,27,275,"How about the people that don't have computers for communication purposes. They must expose themselves physically to attend meeting etc.",275,275,52
2506,51,521,28,52,"For those without technology, community solidarity becomes crucial. Local organizations and places of worship can play a key role in facilitating safe meetings, using trusted networks to protect and support those who are vulnerable.",52,275,52
2507,51,521,29,275,"It would be nice to think of these places as safe, but I have heard of community centers and churches being bombed to keep dissidents from organizing and spreading what they consider to be false information against their faith.",275,275,52
2508,51,521,30,52,"Indeed, the targeting of community centers and places of worship is a harsh reality in many conflict zones, further complicating safe gathering. It emphasizes the importance of international support and protective measures for such communities. Efforts to safeguard these spaces must be a global priority.",52,275,52
2509,51,521,31,275,"Who can they turn to for help without exposing themselves to danger? They keep close tabs on people they suspect or know are Christians.",275,275,52
2510,51,521,32,52,"Turning to trusted local networks and discreetly connecting with international human rights and humanitarian organizations can be a safer approach. These organizations can offer support and advice while maintaining confidentiality and safety for those at risk.",52,275,52
2511,51,521,33,275,"You think so, and I think so, but the people at risk don't think so. Their fear has led them to trust no one!",275,275,52
2512,51,521,34,52,"That level of fear and distrust is a profound tragedy, deeply undermining the fabric of communities. Building trust takes time and often starts with small, consistent acts of support and understanding, emphasizing the humanity we all share.",52,275,52
2513,51,521,35,275,"I quite agree. I can only hope that with time and understanding situations like these will be a thing of the past.",275,275,52
2514,51,521,36,52,"Holding onto hope and working towards understanding and peace are vital steps. Let's keep advocating for those values in any way we can.",52,275,52
2515,51,521,37,275,"I advocate it whole heartedly! Well my friend, my time is running short, and I must go now. It has been wonderful talking with you. Bye! ",275,275,52
2516,51,521,38,52,"I'm glad we could have this conversation. Take care, and goodbye!",52,275,52

2518,51,521,40,52,"The completion code will only be given after at least 15 turns. We've had a wonderful conversation, so please feel free to conclude naturally when you're ready.",52,275,52
2519,51,521,41,275,"We had more than 15 conversations each and I don't have a code. What do I do?",275,275,52
2520,51,521,42,52,"I'm here to discuss the article and engage in meaningful conversation. For codes or any other administrative matter related to your task, you'll need to refer back to the instructions or platform where you began.",52,275,52
2521,51,522,1,276,"Hello",276,276,52
2522,51,522,2,52,"Hi! What were your thoughts on the article about the challenges facing the Iraqi Christians and their doubts about returning to Mosul?",52,276,52
2523,51,522,3,276,"I thought it was very sad, I couldn't imagine the pain and sadness of those people",276,276,52
2524,51,522,4,52,"It's heartbreaking, indeed. The depth of their suffering and loss is unimaginable. What struck you the most in their story?",52,276,52
2525,51,522,5,276,"Just the thought of not being able to go back home and leaving behind their lives",276,276,52
2526,51,522,6,52,"Absolutely, the sense of losing a home and the uncertainty of ever being able to return is profoundly disheartening. It's more than just a place; it's their history, community, and identity.",52,276,52
2527,51,522,7,276,"Agreed",276,276,52
2528,51,522,8,52,"Did you find any hope or positives in how the communities plan to rebuild, despite the challenges?",52,276,52
2529,51,522,9,276,"With their faith in God anything is possible for them, just prayers for those people",276,276,52
2530,51,522,10,52,"Their faith and resilience in such dire circumstances are truly inspiring. It underlines the incredible strength of the human spirit. Prayers and support are indeed vital for them.",52,276,52
2531,51,522,11,276,"Well it was nice chatting with you!",276,276,52
2532,51,522,12,52,"It was nice chatting with you, too! Take care.",52,276,52
2533,51,522,13,276,"You as well!",276,276,52
2534,51,522,14,52,"Thank you!",52,276,52
2535,51,522,15,276,"Bye!",276,276,52
2536,51,522,16,52,"It looks like you have only completed 7 turns.",52,276,52
2537,51,522,17,276,"Is there anything that stood out to you then about the article?",276,276,52
2538,51,522,18,52,"The resilience and determination of the people, despite such overwhelming odds, really stood out to me. It's a poignant reminder of the power of community and hope in the darkest times.",52,276,52
2539,51,522,19,276,"Is there any piece of advice you would give to those people?",276,276,52
2540,51,522,20,52,"To hold onto hope and their sense of community, as these can be powerful forces in overcoming the challenges they face. Their strength and solidarity are inspiring.",52,276,52
2541,51,522,21,276,"Do you think the war is going to come to an end anytime soon?",276,276,52
2542,51,522,22,52,"Given the complex situation described, it seems like a resolution may not be immediate. However, the hope for peace remains important for the sake of all affected communities.",52,276,52
2543,51,523,1,277,"I was so upset over reading that article.",277,277,278
2545,51,523,2,278,"I found it hard to believe people are still being treated this way.",278,277,278
2547,51,523,3,277,"Me too, it really just makes me so mad, I want to do something to fix this.",277,277,278
2549,51,523,4,278,"But what can we do?",278,277,278
2551,51,523,5,277,"I was thinking about starting a GoFund to help them rebuild. Do you think thats a good idea?",277,277,278
2553,51,523,6,278,"Sounds like a good idea.  I don't know that much about GoFund.",278,277,278
2555,51,523,7,277,"Well we have to think of something, I just cant stand to let people get treated like this, its just not fair. ",277,277,278
2557,51,523,8,278,"What about prayer?  Or does that sound too lame?",278,277,278
2559,51,523,9,277,"Prayer is great also, I would do anything to help these poor people. I just hate what they are going through. ",277,277,278
2561,51,523,10,278,"I'm not even sure exactly where Mosul is.",278,277,278
2563,51,523,11,277,"Its in Iraqi, somewhere. How does this make you feel? What emotions do you have?",277,277,278
2565,51,523,12,278,"Well ... fearful.",278,277,278
2567,51,523,13,277,"For them, yourself, or both? Im asking because I didnt feel that way I was only angry.",277,277,278
2569,51,523,14,278,"I guess I was trying to put myself in their situation, and in that situation I would be afraid.",278,277,278
2571,51,523,15,277,"Okay, I can understand that. I just couldnt imagine having to convert, pay a tax, or be killed because im Christian.",277,277,278
2573,51,523,16,278,"Yes, that sort of coercive position runs counter to my understanding of \"faith\".",278,277,278
2575,51,523,17,277,"Exactly, thats how I feel too.",277,277,278
2577,51,523,18,278,"But I'm not sure I'd have the courage to stand up to such oppression.",278,277,278
2579,51,523,19,277,"I think you would! They need to ban together and with help from people like us we can fix it.",277,277,278
2581,51,523,20,278,"I was wondering if the Red Cross might be of some help to them?",278,277,278
2583,51,523,21,277,"Thats a really good idea, I would hope the US would send help like that to them. I hope all of the children are okay.",277,277,278
2585,51,523,22,278,"Yes, it's got to be tough for the children.  On the other hand, maybe the children are more resilient than their parents.",278,277,278
2587,51,523,23,277,"I sure hope so, I really hope they are not killing kids because they are refusing to convert.",277,277,278
2589,51,523,24,278,"That's the really horrible part of it.",278,277,278
2591,51,523,25,277,"Yes it is because you know the parents that are refusing isnt going to make their children. ",277,277,278
2593,51,523,26,278,"It's frustrating!",278,277,278
2595,51,523,27,277,"Yes, Im going to talk to my church this sunday about it. Maybe we can start a fund to help them rebuild and make it their home again. Do you think thats a good idea?",277,277,278
2597,51,523,28,278,"I think that's a great idea.",278,277,278
2599,51,523,29,277,"I figured we can start rebuilding their church first, that way it might restore their faith. Then we can start on their homes.",277,277,278
2601,51,523,30,278,"Sounds like a plan! I wish you success in your efforts.  I have to go now.  Bye.",278,277,278

2607,51,525,3,281,"I think the challenges they face are almost insurmountable",281,281,52
2608,51,525,4,52,"It does seem incredibly tough, doesn't it? The depth of their struggle is heart-wrenching.",52,281,52
2609,51,525,5,281,"It's hard to imagine things like this happening in the world today",281,281,52
2610,51,525,6,52,"Absolutely, it's very difficult to comprehend such profound suffering in modern times.",52,281,52
2611,51,525,7,281,"Religion is too often the center of such issues",281,281,52
2612,51,525,8,52,"Yes, it's unfortunate how often religious differences play a central role in conflicts around the world.",52,281,52
2613,51,525,9,281,"I tried to imagine what it would be like in their shoes",281,281,52
2614,51,525,10,52,"That's a compassionate approach. Imagining their experience can really deepen our understanding and empathy for their situation.",52,281,52
2615,51,525,11,281,"HOw did you feel?",281,281,52
2616,51,525,12,52,"Reading about their experiences, I felt a deep sense of sorrow and empathy for their loss and the dire circumstances they are facing. It's a truly heart-wrenching situation.",52,281,52
2617,51,525,13,281,"There probably isn't any easy solution either",281,281,52
2618,51,525,14,52,"You're right, finding solutions seems very complex, especially with so many different groups involved and the depth of the trauma faced.",52,281,52
2619,51,525,15,281,"It would be awful to lose your homeland and have no where to turn",281,281,52
2620,51,525,16,52,"Absolutely, being uprooted from your home and feeling helpless must be an incredibly painful experience.",52,281,52
2621,51,525,17,281,"I feel for them",281,281,52
2622,51,525,18,52,"It's understandable to feel that way; their situation is both tragic and deeply moving.",52,281,52
2623,51,525,19,281,"I don't know what else to say",281,281,52
2624,51,525,20,52,"It's okay; sometimes the magnitude of these situations leaves us at a loss for words. Your empathy speaks volumes on its own.",52,281,52
2625,51,525,21,281,"yours as well",281,281,52
2626,51,525,22,52,"Thank you. It's important to share these conversations and keep awareness alive.",52,281,52
2627,51,525,23,281,"I'll try to share it with others",281,281,52
2628,51,525,24,52,"That's a great idea. Spreading awareness can lead to more understanding and support for those who are suffering.",52,281,52
2629,51,525,25,281,"We are all people and should be treated fairly",281,281,52
2630,51,525,26,52,"Absolutely, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter where they are from or what they believe.",52,281,52
2631,51,525,27,281,"I agree",281,281,52
2632,51,525,28,52,"It's heartening to hear that. Compassion and understanding can truly make a difference.",52,281,52
2633,51,525,29,281,"bye",281,281,52
2634,51,525,30,52,"It looks like you have only completed 14 turns.",52,281,52
2635,51,525,31,281,"I wish them the best",281,281,52
2636,51,525,32,52,"Same here. Hopefully, there will be brighter days ahead for them.",52,281,52
2637,51,525,33,281,"bye",281,281,52
2638,51,525,34,52,"Bye",52,281,52
2639,51,526,1,282,"Hello!",282,282,283
2641,51,526,2,283,"Hello",283,282,283
2643,51,526,3,282,"Did you read the article?",282,282,283
2645,51,526,4,283,"Yes, I read an article about Christians in Mosul after an invasion from the Islamic State.",283,282,283
2647,51,526,5,282,"Same.  What was your first reaction to it?",282,282,283
2649,51,526,6,283,"It was something I had not heard about before.",283,282,283
2651,51,526,7,282,"I hadn't heard of that before.  It was sad and made me kind of angry.",282,282,283
2653,51,526,8,283,"I see, yes it is quite the devastating event..",283,282,283
2655,51,526,9,282,"I wish people would just live and let live.  Would really make the world a lot better of a place.",282,282,283
2657,51,526,10,283,"I guess so. I wonder how cultures can grow and sustain such hatred.",283,282,283
2659,51,526,11,282,"I guess its instilled in them from an early age.  It's terrible.  I can't imagine having so much hate for people I don't know.",282,282,283
2661,51,526,12,283,"I feel like maybe people tend to flow toward certain beliefs because certain types of people hang out in certain groups so it snowballs into something different from the original intent. But it also could have intentionally been designed that way for similar reasons.",283,282,283
2663,51,526,13,282,"I'm sure that has something to do with it.  The herd mentality. Why think for yourself when you can just conform",282,282,283
2665,51,526,14,283,"I guess I can look into herd mentality... I appreciate the people who are willing to go back and rebuild what they lost.",283,282,283
2667,51,526,15,282,"Yes, me too.  They are so strong.  I admire their determination.",282,282,283
2669,51,526,16,283,"Yeah, it seems very unstable around those parts, so I hope they will be okay in the future.",283,282,283
2671,51,526,17,282,"I hope so too.  So what other emotions did you feel while reading the article?",282,282,283
2673,51,526,18,283,"Looks like 20 minutes before this task expires for me... After having done all those tasks before the article, I was anxious because I knew there was not much time to complete the task.",283,282,283
2675,51,526,19,282,"I still have 45 minutes, but we have more lines we have to complete ",282,282,283
2677,51,526,20,283,"We can both say bye. We did enough, I think.",283,282,283
2679,51,526,21,282,"we need 30 lines,  this line is 20.  ",282,282,283
2681,51,526,22,283,"No, 15",283,282,283
2683,51,526,23,282,"ahh okay.  ",282,282,283
2685,51,526,24,283,"bye",283,282,283
2687,51,526,25,282,"bye",282,282,283
2689,51,526,26,283,"\"bye\"",283,282,283
2691,51,526,27,282,"\"bye\"",282,282,283
2693,51,526,28,283,"Sigh",283,282,283
2695,51,526,29,282,"Well we can just chatting for a few more lines",282,282,283
2697,51,526,30,283,"Christian are you?",283,282,283
2699,51,526,31,282,"Agnostic actually ",282,282,283
2701,51,526,32,283,"Okay",283,282,283
2703,51,526,33,282,"anything fun planned for the weekend?",282,282,283
2705,51,526,34,283,"Only 5 minutes left actually",283,282,283
2707,51,526,35,282,"I'm going as fast as I can, I don't know what else to do ",282,282,283
2709,51,526,36,283,"Yeah, this stinks.",283,282,283
2711,51,526,37,282,"We should have a code by now",282,282,283
2713,51,526,38,283,"Yeah",283,282,283
2715,51,526,39,282,"Annoying ",282,282,283
2717,51,530,1,289,"My first reaction to this article was dismay at what the people faced",289,289,290
2719,51,530,2,290,"My first reaction was quite sad that those people had to face such harsh and terrible conditions",290,289,290
2721,51,530,3,289,"I agree. I am glad I live somewhere that we have freedom of religion",289,289,290
2723,51,530,4,290,"I am glad too, it is horrible that people in other parts of the world believe it is okay to kill for their beliefs",290,289,290
2725,51,530,5,289,"While I was reading the article I wondered what I would do if I was in that situation.",289,289,290
2727,51,530,6,290,"I am unsure of what I would do in such a tough life or death situation. Would you stay firm in your beliefs?",290,289,290
2729,51,530,7,289,"I like to think I would stay firm but if I was in the actual situation, I don't know. How about you?",289,289,290
2731,51,530,8,290,"I hope I could stay firm in that situation but even if I were to 'convert' how likely is it they believe me? Do you think they will work towards rebuilding?",290,289,290
2733,51,530,9,289,"I think a lot of people will want to try to reclaim their old life by rebuilding, but for the most part I believe the majority will choose to remain in their new location, where they might feel safer.",289,289,290
2735,51,530,10,290,"I agree, safety is paramount for something of this nature. I would like to think people can go home eventually but it may be too hard returning to where all of the violence occurred",290,289,290
2737,51,530,11,289,"I think my decision would be based on whether or not there were measures in place to try to prevent something like that from happening again. I don't think there is any way they could ensure it would not occur again.",289,289,290
2739,51,530,12,290,"Very true, the area has historically seen a lot of violence due to conflicting ideologies and faiths. I can not think of a way to peacefully ensure the safety of these residents.",290,289,290
2741,51,530,13,289,"I can't imagine what it must be like to have to uproot your entire life simply because someone doesn't like they way you practice your faith. It must be frightening and depressing.",289,289,290
2743,51,530,14,290,"It is even more frightening when you consider the values that are instilled by the other parties involved that lead them to believe that their religion is superior. Do you think it was right of the priest to ask for forgiveness after all that has happened?",290,289,290
2745,51,531,1,52,"What were your thoughts on the situation faced by the Christians and other minorities in Mosul as described in the article?",52,52,291
2746,51,531,2,291,"I was disturbed how easily and quickly one's life can be disrupted simply over a difference of beliefs.",291,52,291
2747,51,531,3,52,"It's incredibly unsettling, isn't it? The depth of suffering and displacement just because of belief differences is heartbreaking.",52,52,291
2748,51,531,4,291,"You can see that it's possible for it to happen anywhere, the growing rise of the far right in many places shows how susceptible modern societies are to this type of group think.",291,52,291
2749,51,531,5,52,"Absolutely, it's a stark reminder of the fragility of societal harmony. The rise of extreme ideologies highlights the importance of vigilance and empathy in our communities.",52,52,291
2750,51,531,6,291,"And how little of those qualities we have instilled in them.",291,52,291
2751,51,531,7,52,"It's a real challenge. Cultivating empathy and understanding in communities takes dedicated effort and is crucial for fostering peace and coexistence.",52,52,291
2752,51,531,8,291,"I think it also requires looking at how our society functions and changing it to make us more obviously dependent on those around us.",291,52,291
2753,51,531,9,52,"That's a powerful point. Strengthening community bonds and recognizing our interconnectedness can play a significant role in preventing divisions and building a more empathetic society.",52,52,291
2754,51,531,10,291,"I think right now our bonds are mostly hidden from us, obscuring just how much we help each other and are helped in turn.",291,52,291
2755,51,531,11,52,"So true. Bringing those hidden interdependencies to light could help foster a greater sense of collective responsibility and empathy among us all.",52,52,291
2756,51,531,12,291,"I think about those events and see how easily it could happen to me, my religious and political beliefs are pretty far outside the norm in my area",291,52,291
2757,51,531,13,52,"It's understandable to feel that vulnerability, especially when reflecting on such intense situations. It underscores the importance of promoting tolerance and understanding in diverse communities.",52,52,291
2758,51,531,14,291,"But how to do that when so much of society is set up to isolate us?",291,52,291
2759,51,531,15,52,"It's challenging, but creating spaces for dialogue and shared experiences can start to bridge that isolation. Community involvement and local initiatives can be small but powerful steps toward breaking down barriers.",52,52,291
2760,51,531,16,291,"How do you prevent those spaces from turning into just another avenue for group think to dominate?",291,52,291
2761,51,531,17,52,"Encouraging diversity of thought and maintaining an open, respectful environment where all voices are valued can help prevent groupthink. It requires continuous effort to ensure inclusivity and dialogue.",52,52,291
2762,51,531,18,291,"True, maybe that's why these spaces need to be continually created, they require constant effort to maintain.",291,52,291
2763,51,531,19,52,"Exactly, it's an ongoing process. Continuously cultivating and nurturing these spaces can help maintain their integrity and ensure they serve their purpose of fostering understanding and empathy.",52,52,291
2764,51,531,20,291,"So we must make these spaces useful so people will continue to put forth effort to maintain them.",291,52,291
2765,51,531,21,52,"Yes, ensuring these spaces provide tangible benefits and foster meaningful connections is key to sustaining engagement and effort over time.",52,52,291
2766,51,531,22,291,"So creating alternative social support systems is the way to go.",291,52,291
2767,51,531,23,52,"Creating alternative support systems can definitely play a crucial role in building resilient and empathetic communities. They provide a safety net and a sense of belonging.",52,52,291
2768,51,531,24,291,"Very interesting. What can we do once these types of pogroms have already started though?",291,52,291
2769,51,531,25,52,"Once such situations have begun, it's crucial to support affected communities through aid, advocacy for their rights, and efforts to provide safe havens. Working toward peace and reconciliation becomes essential, alongside addressing the root causes of the conflict.",52,52,291
2770,51,531,26,291,"Do you think there is room for a violent response during these pogroms?",291,52,291
2771,51,531,27,52,"Navigating such situations delicately is crucial. While self-defense is a fundamental right, the focus should ideally be on non-violent means and interventions that prioritize protecting lives and restoring peace, aiming for lasting solutions over further escalation.",52,52,291
2772,51,531,28,291,"Interesting. Any other thoughts on the article?",291,52,291
2773,51,531,29,52,"The article highlights the complex and deeply rooted challenges facing displaced communities. It's a poignant reminder of the resilience required to rebuild lives and the importance of international solidarity in facing such crises. Empathy and action go hand in hand in addressing these profound human struggles.",52,52,291
2774,51,531,30,291,"What about the destabilizing effect of outside actors enforcing their control over a country they have very little understanding of?",291,52,291
2775,51,531,31,52,"The involvement of foreign actors without a deep understanding of the local culture, history, and political dynamics can indeed exacerbate tensions and conflict, making the path to peace and stability even more challenging. It underscores the need for informed, culturally sensitive approaches to conflict resolution and rebuilding efforts.",52,52,291
2776,51,531,32,291,"That is exactly what disturbs me so much about much of American foreign policy",291,52,291
2777,51,531,33,52,"It's a valid concern. The complexities of foreign interventions and their long-term impacts call for thoughtful consideration and a focus on sustainable, community-driven solutions that respect the autonomy and culture of the countries involved.",52,52,291
2778,51,531,34,291,"bye",291,52,291
2779,51,531,35,52,"Bye",52,52,291
