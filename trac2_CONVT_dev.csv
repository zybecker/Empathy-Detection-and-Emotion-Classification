66,9,74,6,"81","Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause?",81,61,81,2,1,3,NULL

71,9,74,11,"61","yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?",61,61,81,2,1,3,NULL
72,9,74,12,"81","I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.",81,61,81,2,1,3,NULL

362,14,108,2,"60","Hi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.",60,69,60,3,2,3,NULL
363,14,108,3,"69","I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.",69,69,60,3,2,3,NULL
364,14,108,4,"60","Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.",60,69,60,3,2,2,NULL
365,14,108,5,"69","True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.",69,69,60,3,1,2,NULL
366,14,108,6,"60","Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.  Obviously most 52-year-olds have children, but to have it explicitly stated makes it strike home that those adult children just lost their dad.",60,69,60,4,2,3,NULL
367,14,108,7,"69","Yeah, I couldn't imagine losing my father suddenly like this. It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.",69,69,60,4,2,1.5,NULL
368,14,108,8,"60","Yes, I'm sure.  And I'm sure they were proud of him.  But I imagine that makes the loss even harder.",60,69,60,4,2,2,NULL
369,14,108,9,"69","Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?",69,69,60,1,1,1.5,NULL
370,14,108,10,"60","It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?",60,69,60,2,1,2,NULL
371,14,108,11,"69","I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. ",69,69,60,2,2,1,NULL
372,14,108,12,"60","Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.",60,69,60,2,2,1,NULL
373,14,108,13,"69","I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. ",69,69,60,2,2,1,NULL
374,14,108,14,"60","Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.  So I'm sure in an instance like this--in all that chaos--there's all sorts of incorrect information or speculation and that uncertainty is one of the reasons why the whole airport can get shut down.",60,69,60,2,2,1.5,NULL
375,14,108,15,"69","Yeah I suppose when there are lots of people in one place like this, when things go down it would be a bit crazy. Information may come in, but it has to be verified by looking at the footage, searching the airport, etc. Do you think anything could have been done to prevent the attack, or was it just something no one could have anticipated?",69,69,60,2,1,2,NULL
376,14,108,16,"60","It's hard to say without more evidence of what actually motivated it.  I think the reality is that if one deranged person wants to kill you, there's not a lot you can do to stop it.  That's just life, and we shouldn't turn the world upside down to stop things we can't stop.",60,69,60,2,2,2,NULL
377,14,108,17,"69","Yeah, once again I wish there was some more information here. I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.",69,69,60,2,2,3,NULL
378,14,108,18,"60","Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.",60,69,60,2,1,1,NULL
379,14,108,19,"69","I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.",69,69,60,1,2,2,NULL
380,14,108,20,"60","Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.",60,69,60,2,2,2,NULL
381,14,108,21,"69","I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.",69,69,60,2,2,3,NULL
382,14,108,22,"60","Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?",60,69,60,2,2,2,NULL
383,14,108,23,"69","Its hard to media that just sticks to the facts, and the stuff relevant to the story. Plus stuff that is truly unbiased. I'm really not sure what I'd want to learn. I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.",69,69,60,2,1,3,NULL
384,14,108,24,"60","Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.",60,69,60,3,2,4,NULL
385,14,108,25,"69","If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.",69,69,60,3,2,3,NULL
386,14,108,26,"60","Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.",60,69,60,2,2,3,NULL
387,14,108,27,"69","Yeah. Well it looks like we are coming to our final messages. Its been good talking with you. I'm glad you feel the same way about the article.",69,69,60,2,0,3,NULL

701,17,170,11,"135","I can agree with that. In war, it seems like civilians are seen simply as numbers, rather than human beings living real lives. It's hard to accept that some people are dehumanized in that way. We'd never accept such a thing happening in the U.S.",135,135,136,2,2,3,NULL

Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything.

719,17,170,29,"135","Yeah... It seems that way. I wish I could show these people a better life somehow. It's so sad that people are forced to live their only life in the midst of a warzone. I know it's improbable, but I still wish I could.",135,135,136,2,2,4,NULL

Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.",60,137,60,2,2,1,NULL

Yes we were presented with a small amount of info from the article I probably asked a crazy question lol I was just brainstorming on the idea you had because I thought it was really good about dropping in the food that was really good ",61,107,61,2,0,3,NULL
803,18,173,23,"107","yeah i think that might be the best. dropping some sort of food via air drop. wither it be live game they can \"hunt\" still themselves. or some sort of food already cut up for them. some way that can still give them a sense of they are doing it on their own lol",107,107,61,2,0,3,NULL
804,18,173,24,"61","Live game that's pretty good right there too. That way they don't become human dependent and don't forget to learn how to hunt ",61,107,61,2,0,3,NULL

816,18,174,6,"139","Yeah, it is not fun to think that we might be causing issues for the polar bears. It was a bit of an eye opener to make me think about it like that.",139,122,139,2,2,3,NULL

832,18,174,22,"139","I sure hope so, but I'm not sure. It seems like it might already be too late, but scientific advances are always surprising me. Also as it gets harder and harder to deny it, more money will get invested in research.",139,122,139,2,1,2,NULL
833,18,174,23,"122","I hope so as well. I get a bit nervous for my kids and society's future when I think about the lasting impacts.",122,122,139,3,2,2,NULL

835,18,174,25,"122","Great point, I hope that is a selling point for others! I just can't understand why some people chose to disregard the issue. Unfortunately the government may need to impost stricter guidelines for people like that.",122,122,139,3,2,3,NULL
836,18,174,26,"139","Gonna be hard to impose stricter guidelines since people who don't believe in it are generally against more government interference. Fingers crossed though they will change their mind.",139,122,139,2,1,3,NULL

944,19,184,14,"145","Yeah, I live in Texas and have seen similar things happen quite a bit. It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. ",145,144,145,2,1,4,NULL
945,19,184,15,"144","That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.",144,144,145,1,1,3,NULL
946,19,184,16,"145","No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities. We have deported people who served in the military when it turned out that they weren't really citizens.",145,144,145,2,2,3,NULL
947,19,184,17,"144","What?! That is crazy!",144,144,145,3,2,2,NULL
948,19,184,18,"145","Sure, dreamers who have been here nearly their entire lives who wanted to serve their country. Sad and ridiculous.",145,144,145,2.5,2,2,NULL
949,19,184,19,"144","They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.",144,144,145,3,2,3,NULL
950,19,184,20,"145","The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people. When I read about the man in the article all I saw was us punishing someone who was trying to do the right thing. The thing is that most of the people around here are all for that sort of behavior.",145,144,145,2,2,3,NULL
951,19,184,21,"144","I wouldn't be surprised. Many people in America are oppressors. Even some of the oppressed go on to oppress people who are more vulnerable than them. I feel sad for them going through such things.",144,144,145,2.5,2,3,NULL
952,19,184,22,"145","Yeah, it seems like a lot of us need someone to hate.",145,144,145,2,2,2,NULL
953,19,184,23,"144","That type of personality is so lazy - taking the easy way out. The regrets later are going to hit them like a ton of bricks.",144,144,145,2.5,2,2,NULL
954,19,184,24,"145","Maybe, but a lot of them are so convinced that they are right that I doubt their conscious will ever bother them. ",145,144,145,2,1,2,NULL
955,19,184,25,"144","Aww, I don't like the thought of that. I was about to say someone must have told them they are doing wrong, but then they surround themselves with people who tell them that they are doing right. It's disheartening. I wonder what makes some people aware and while others are not.",144,144,145,3,2,2,NULL
956,19,184,26,"145","I think that people get in echo chambers with others who feel the same way they do, and they convince each other that they are right and the rest of the world is wrong. It would be funny if it didn't hurt others so much..",145,144,145,2,2,2,NULL
957,19,184,27,"144","Oh, yeah. And if no physical person is there, they can go online where there is bound to be some people who agrees with them.",144,144,145,2,1,2,NULL
958,19,184,28,"145","YouTube too. One of my friends got me to look at a video about 9/11. For the next month everything I got in my feed was a conspiracy theory, one crazier than the other. No wonder people are scared.",145,144,145,2,2,1,NULL
959,19,184,29,"144","Oh, those conspiracy theories are very weird! On was about the moon landing being faked. I like astronomy and they had my curiosity piqued.",144,144,145,2,1,1,NULL
960,19,184,30,"145","The scary thing is that the more facts you give them that show they are wrong, the more convinced they are that they are right.",145,144,145,2.5,1,1,NULL
961,19,190,1,"149","Hi",149,149,130,1,1,1,NULL
962,19,190,2,"130","Hey",130,149,130,1,1,1,NULL
963,19,190,3,"149","How are you doing?",149,149,130,1,1,1,NULL
964,19,190,4,"130","I'm pretty good. How about you?",130,149,130,1.5,0,1,NULL
965,19,190,5,"149","Not bad.   So, what did you think about the article on Adam Crapser?   I feel very sympathetic for him as I don't believe that he is responsible for his situation.",149,149,130,1.5,2,3,NULL
966,19,190,6,"130","It's horrible. I feel like an exception should be made in his case. It wasn't his fault.",130,149,130,2.5,2,4,NULL
967,19,190,7,"149","There were obvious mistakes made during the adoption process when he was a child.  He should not be punished for those mistakes.",149,149,130,2,2,3,NULL
968,19,190,8,"130","No, he shouldn't. And to make matters worse, his family is going to suffer.",130,149,130,2.5,2,3,NULL
969,19,190,9,"149","I agree.   Deporting him rips his family apart and causes everyone to suffer.",149,149,130,2,2,3,NULL
970,19,190,10,"130","And all for what was essentially a paperwork error. Given the life he lived up to that point with the abuse he suffered, it's hard to not feel sorry for him.",130,149,130,2,2,4,NULL
971,19,190,11,"149","This case was a few years ago.  Do you know what eventually transpired?",149,149,130,1.5,1,0,NULL
972,19,190,12,"130","Supposedly there was a bill that was being debated in Congress. I don't know if it passed, but I think it might've been too late for Crapser anyway. ",130,149,130,1.5,2,2,NULL
973,19,190,13,"149","Yeah.  Looks that way.  I think that he was eventually deported.   Too bad the case didn't get more media attention at the time it was happening.",149,149,130,2,2,2,NULL
974,19,190,14,"130","Yeah, it might've caused congress to solve the immigration problem once and for all. A missed opportunity and now more will suffer.",130,149,130,2,2,2,NULL
975,19,190,15,"149","It's even worse because his kids are really young and at the age where they need a father presence in their lives.",149,149,130,2.5,2,3,NULL
976,19,190,16,"130","Yeah, it just wasn't worth causing kids to grow up in a broken home to deport this man.",130,149,130,2.5,2,3,NULL
977,19,190,17,"149","I believe that there were a lot of \"hidden\" issues in the adoption system back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.   I don't think a lot of changes were made until issues were identified starting in the 1980s.",149,149,130,2.5,2,0,NULL
978,19,190,18,"130","It's probably still broken. I hope no other family has to go through this. Just no excuse for it. Hopefully Crapser found a way to get back to his family.",130,149,130,2,2,3,NULL
979,19,190,19,"149","I just feel sad and angry that we, as a nation, allowed his situation to get to that point.",149,149,130,2,2,3,NULL
980,19,190,20,"130","People don't pay too much attention to issues, which is the problem. If it doesn't affect them personally, they don't care.",130,149,130,2.5,2,2,NULL
981,19,190,21,"149","I just wish that a politician in his state had championed his situation and tried to prevent the deportation.",149,149,130,2,1,2,NULL
982,19,190,22,"130","Yeah, they probably could've gotten a lot of advertising and fundraising out of it. It would've been a win-win.",130,149,130,2,1,2,NULL
983,19,190,23,"149","Also, most of this transpired during the Obama administration.   The Trump administration became even more hardline on deportations.",149,149,130,1.5,1,1,NULL
984,19,190,24,"130","I think some deportations should have exemptions made for them. A lot shouldn't be eligible like unauthorized border-crossings, but this was a unique situation.",130,149,130,1.5,1,2,NULL
985,19,190,25,"149","The other sad fact is that Adam was deported to South Korea but he has no idea how to speak Korean.",149,149,130,2,2,3,NULL
986,19,190,26,"130","That's horrible. It must be scary being deported to a country you've never known and you can't even speak the language there.",130,149,130,2,2,4,NULL
987,19,190,27,"149","Yep.   It's like being thrust into an environment that you have had no exposure to.   The whole cycle of trauma now passes down to another generation.",149,149,130,2.5,2,3,NULL
988,19,190,28,"130","Nobody should ever have to go through what Crapser did. I hope he's doing better these days.",130,149,130,2,1,3,NULL
989,19,190,29,"149","I hope that someone read about his case and was willing to support him and his family financially or to even relocate them to a third country.   Canada has always seemed very open to refugees?",149,149,130,2.5,0,3,NULL
990,19,190,30,"130","Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe someone could start a crowdfund for him.",130,149,130,2,0,0,NULL
