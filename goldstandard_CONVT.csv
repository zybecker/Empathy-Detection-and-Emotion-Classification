47,492,6,52,"It's a stark contrast, isn't it? It seems like there are discrepancies in how these situations are handled, which is incredibly unfair to Nosey and other animals in similar positions.

47,492,8,52,"Absolutely, it's clear that the unique and complex needs of elephants like Nosey are not being met, which is deeply troubling.

47,492,10,52,"That's a very good point. The initial acquisition and the ability of private individuals or entities to provide adequate care should definitely be scrutinized more thoroughly.

47,492,18,52,"It is indeed frustrating, but the power of community action in driving change is a beacon of hope.

47,492,20,52,"You're right, having detailed information about the specific violations could help the public understand the severity of the situation and what actions are needed to prevent such cases in the future. Itâ€™s crucial to know when and how to intervene effectively to protect the welfare of animals like Nosey. Educating ourselves on these matters can certainly empower more effective advocacy and legal action.",52,207,52,"2.6666666666666665","0.0","4.0"
47,492,21,207,"The article said Nosey has arthritis, I believe. I wish the author would have elaborated on whether or not Nosey was regularly seeing a veterianrian.",207,207,52,"2.3333333333333335","1.5","1.5"
47,492,22,52,"Yes, the mention of arthritis raises serious concerns about her well-being and the level of medical care she's receiving. It would have indeed been helpful if the article provided more details about her access to veterinary care to better understand her health status and the care she's under. Proper medical attention is critical for her condition.",52,207,52,"2.6666666666666665","1.0","3.5"
47,492,23,207,"I also wonder if lack of veterinarian care was one of the violations or if a veterinarian was someone who reported the owner for a violation.",207,207,52,"1.3333333333333333","1.0","2.5"
47,492,24,52,"That's an insightful thought. If lack of veterinary care was among the violations, it underscores the severity of the neglect. Alternatively, if a veterinarian raised concerns leading to a violation report, it highlights the importance of professional oversight in ensuring the well-being of animals like Nosey. Either scenario would underscore significant issues with her care.",52,207,52,"1.6666666666666667","1.5","3.0"
47,492,25,207,"I'm glad there is attention being brought about Nosey. If more people see how badly she's treated they will stop paying to go to the show",207,207,52,"1.3333333333333333","0.5","3.5"
47,492,26,52,"Absolutely, public awareness can lead to a decrease in support for venues that mistreat animals, ultimately putting pressure on owners to change their practices or cease operations. Highlighting Nosey's plight is a step towards ending such treatment and encouraging more ethical interactions with animals.",52,207,52,"1.3333333333333333","0.5","4.0"
47,492,27,207,"It's also about supply and demand, the owner needs money to provide care for her so if people don't go to the show he loses money and no longer has a reason to keep her.",207,207,52,"1.3333333333333333","1.0","3.5"
47,492,28,52,"That's a very logical point. Reducing the demand for such shows can indeed impact the financial viability of keeping animals like Nosey in inadequate conditions. It's a potential pathway toward encouraging change or relinquishing animals to better-equipped sanctuaries where they can be properly cared for.",52,207,52,"0.6666666666666666","1.0","3.5"
47,492,29,207,"But I worry that instead of giving her up he'll still keep her and her conditions will get worse because he doesn't have the money to take care of her. The government agencies are already failing to help her so I'm not confident they will help her then either.",207,207,52,"2.0","2.0","3.5"
47,492,30,52,"Your concern is valid. It highlights the complex nature of solving situations like Nosey's where the well-being of the animal must be prioritized, alongside ensuring that actions taken do not inadvertently worsen their conditions. It underscores the need for robust, enforceable policies and interventions from government agencies to safeguard animals effectively in these scenarios.",52,207,52,"1.3333333333333333","1.0","3.5"
