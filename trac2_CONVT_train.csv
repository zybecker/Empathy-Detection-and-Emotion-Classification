0,35,1,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p019","p012",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
1,35,1,1,"Person 2","It's definitely really sad to read, considering everything they're all going through. What did you think?","p019","p012",3,2,4.3333,2
2,35,1,2,"Person 1","I think it's super sad... they seem to never catch a break, always struggling.","p019","p012",3.6667,2,4.6667,2.6667
3,35,1,3,"Person 2","I can't imagine just living in an area that is constantly being ravaged by hurricanes or earthquakes. I take my location for granted.","p019","p012",3,2,4.6667,3.3333
4,35,1,4,"Person 1","Me too.. I also can't imagine living in the poverty and such.. It's crazy to think that people still live like that sometimes.  The gap between first world countires and places like that is crazy to em","p019","p012",3.3333,2,4.6667,3
5,35,1,5,"Person 2","It also seems unnecessary for there to even be such a gap. With all of the wealthy countries out there, I hope Haiti gets the help it deserves, because we, and other countries, can certainly afford it.","p019","p012",2,2,3.3333,2.3333
6,35,1,6,"Person 1","Agreed... with how frivilous and unnessary our spending is, it's so sad that countries like that don't get more support or guidance.","p019","p012",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
7,35,1,7,"Person 2","It's disheartening, isn't it? Places have the ability, money, time, and knowledge, and still refuse to help.","p019","p012",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
8,35,1,8,"Person 1","It is so sad... Or even the millionaires/billionaires out there. I know some of them donate, but at some point, you can only spend so much money. Why not put it to use.","p019","p012",3.3333,2,4,2.6667
9,35,1,9,"Person 2","Yep, exactly. It's just very frustrating overall. I think it's hard for others because they don't understand until their houses are being swept away for torrential floods.","p019","p012",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
10,35,1,10,"Person 1","It is hard to fathom/process, it's hard for me to really imagine","p019","p012",2.6667,2,4,2.6667
11,35,1,11,"Person 2","Give it twenty more years, for the more compassionate people to come into leadership. I think we'll see a big difference.","p019","p012",2.3333,0,3.6667,2.3333
12,35,1,12,"Person 1","I think that is a fair statement... the new generation seems more caring and compassionate and willing to help","p019","p012",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.6667
13,35,1,13,"Person 2","I know it sounds cold, but the older generation either doesn't care, or doesn't want to understand. Trust me, we'll see some major change soon enough.","p019","p012",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
14,35,1,14,"Person 1","I totally agree... I know there are some out there that care, but the majority, and the ones in charge, really don't seem to","p019","p012",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
15,35,1,15,"Person 2","Well, it was really great talking to you. I can't think of anything else to say about the topic. goodbye","p019","p012",2,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
16,35,1,16,"Person 1","we don't have enough lines yet","p019","p012",1,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
17,35,1,17,"Person 2","I apologize, I thought we did! I'm obviously a winner at counting. Hurricane Matthew was two years ago, wasn't it?","p019","p012",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
18,35,1,18,"Person 1","Haha no worries, we should be there now. That sounds about right to me, crazy, time flies, seems like I was just hearing about it","p019","p012",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
19,35,1,19,"Person 2","I think I recall it spawning a second hurricane, too, but it calmed down before being too bad. Yeah, I was definitely a few lines off lol","p019","p012",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
20,35,1,20,"Person 1","I kinda remember that too...Well it has been great talking to you! bye :)","p019","p012",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,2
21,35,1,21,"Person 2","take care! goodbye","p019","p012",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
22,35,2,0,"Person 1","I feel very sad for the people.","p035","p022",3,2,3.3333,3
23,35,2,1,"Person 2","It's terrible. Not only the people but the animals as well!","p035","p022",4,2,3.3333,2.6667
24,35,2,2,"Person 1","Yeah, the whole situation is horrible.","p035","p022",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
25,35,2,3,"Person 2","I really wish there was something i could do.","p035","p022",3.6667,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
26,35,2,4,"Person 1","I know we can donate, but it's hard to know exactly how the money is used.","p035","p022",3,1.6667,2.3333,3.3333
27,35,2,5,"Person 2","I agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane?","p035","p022",2,1,0.3333,2.6667
28,35,2,6,"Person 1","No, and You?","p035","p022",1,1.3333,0.3333,2
29,35,2,7,"Person 2","Yes! It's actually terrifying. We were supposed to evacuate but decided to stay because we thought , what's the worst that can happen?","p035","p022",4.3333,2,0.3333,2.3333
30,35,2,8,"Person 1","Sorry to hear that, I'm glad that you are okay!","p035","p022",3,0.3333,0.3333,2.6667
31,35,2,9,"Person 2","Thank you! I'm glad that we still had water and electricity. I can't even imagine what the people over in Haiti are going through","p035","p022",3,1,3,2.3333
32,35,2,10,"Person 1","I felt really sorry for the sister that now has to rise her siblings.","p035","p022",3.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
33,35,2,11,"Person 2","Yeah, it's going to be tough but i am sure she is strong enough to raise them.","p035","p022",3,0.6667,2,2
34,35,2,12,"Person 1","Yeah, we never know what we can do unless we are tested.","p035","p022",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
35,35,2,13,"Person 2","True. Have you been in ANY kind of natural disasters?","p035","p022",1.3333,1,0.3333,2
36,35,2,14,"Person 1","Tornado when I was young. They suck too.","p035","p022",2,2,1.6667,3.3333
37,35,2,15,"Person 2","Never been in one but i can only imagine it's even scarier than a hurricane","p035","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
38,35,2,16,"Person 1","The power of nature is truly scary.","p035","p022",3.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
39,35,2,17,"Person 2","Agree. I hope those people get some water and food as soon as possible","p035","p022",2.6667,1,3.6667,2.6667
40,35,2,18,"Person 1","Me too, I wish there was a direct way to aid the people.","p035","p022",2.6667,1,3.6667,3
41,35,2,19,"Person 2","Yup! Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p035","p022",2,0.3333,0.3333,2.3333
42,35,2,20,"Person 1","You too! bye","p035","p022",2,0.3333,0.3333,1.3333
43,35,3,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article","p024","p020",0.6667,1,0.3333,1.6667
44,35,3,1,"Person 2","It was such an eye opener about the suffering that happens that you never hear about","p024","p020",3.3333,1.6667,4,2.3333
45,35,3,2,"Person 1","its crazy the stuff that goes on in this world","p024","p020",4,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
46,35,3,3,"Person 2","right i can't believe it. If that was the US they would be set up to avoid fsilure","p024","p020",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
47,35,3,4,"Person 1","yeah some countries are so corrupt though","p024","p020",3.3333,2,3,2
48,35,3,5,"Person 2","true, i heard in puerto rico they did not even distrubute the hurricane supplies the US gave them","p024","p020",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
49,35,3,6,"Person 1","i remember  trump throwing toilet paper rolls at the crowd in puerto rico that was so embarrasing","p024","p020",3.3333,2,2,2.6667
50,35,3,7,"Person 2","o wow that is very embarrassing and degrading","p024","p020",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
51,35,3,8,"Person 1","yeah wonder what was going through is head","p024","p020",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
52,35,3,9,"Person 2","probably a power trip or an i'm better than you moment","p024","p020",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
53,35,3,10,"Person 1","what do you think can be done to help the people in haiti","p024","p020",2.3333,0.6667,1,1.6667
54,35,3,11,"Person 2","I think they should do a telethon get a bunch of celebrities and make a hashtag. encourage people to donate and volunteer","p024","p020",2,0.3333,3,2.3333
55,35,3,12,"Person 1","makes sense. also find better ways rather than trucks that are easily looted by the people","p024","p020",2.6667,0.6667,3,2.3333
56,35,3,13,"Person 2","ahh so true!also insure that when you say there is enough for everyone that there actually is.","p024","p020",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
57,35,3,14,"Person 1","and also not let the haitian govt get there hands on any of it they are corrupt","p024","p020",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
58,35,3,15,"Person 2","America should dethrone the government and make it the 51st state","p024","p020",3,1.3333,2.6667,2
59,35,3,16,"Person 1","thats a great idea","p024","p020",2.3333,0.3333,1,1.6667
60,35,3,17,"Person 2","hopefully these people get the help they need i am going to look into it after this","p024","p020",2,0.6667,3.3333,2
61,35,3,18,"Person 1","me too very interested in the outcome","p024","p020",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
62,35,3,19,"Person 2","so crazy the suffering that is going on that we have no idea about","p024","p020",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
63,35,3,20,"Person 1","were lucky to live here","p024","p020",2.3333,0,1.6667,3
64,35,3,21,"Person 2","i agree makes my troubles seem so small","p024","p020",3.3333,0,2.3333,3
65,35,3,22,"Person 1","yeah makes u realize your problems are miniscule in comparison","p024","p020",3,0,2.6667,2.3333
66,35,3,23,"Person 2","i agree. it was so nice chatting with you. goodbye","p024","p020",1.6667,0,0.6667,1.3333
67,35,3,24,"Person 1","bye","p024","p020",1,1,0.3333,1
68,35,4,0,"Person 1","Do you think the people of Haiti will ever recover from the effects of these recent natural disasters?","p041","p071",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1
69,35,4,1,"Person 2","I am not sure it is a quite poor area :(","p041","p071",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
70,35,4,2,"Person 1","Yes it is. The people there need a lot of help. What do you think are some of the best ways to get them the help they need","p041","p071",2.3333,1,3,1.3333
71,35,4,3,"Person 2","I think if the UN is able to get them the required funds that will help a lot.","p041","p071",2,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
72,35,4,4,"Person 1","I am inclined to disagree. More money is only a temporary solution. I think they need lasting change","p041","p071",2,2,2.6667,2.6667
73,35,4,5,"Person 2","Yes, I hear there is a lot of corruption there as well, that is also a problem. Money is short term","p041","p071",2,2,3.6667,1.6667
74,35,4,6,"Person 1","Yes corruption is a huge problem. I think the NGO's and the UN should focus more on teaching the Haitian people to help themselves and develop the country","p041","p071",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
75,35,4,7,"Person 2","Yes getting a better government is the best way to help any region. Most countries, do not absolutely need outside for every disaster","p041","p071",2,1.3333,3,2
76,35,4,8,"Person 1","I don't think the US wants a ''better'' government. They want a government they can control or influence. Corruption helps with that agenda","p041","p071",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
77,35,4,9,"Person 2","Yes two things can be true at once though. They want a better government but also try to get power and control in the process.","p041","p071",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
78,35,4,10,"Person 1","Do you think the United States has a vested interest in a developed and autonomous Haiti? I don't think so","p041","p071",2.3333,2,1,2
79,35,4,11,"Person 2","Yeah I would not count on it. So you think the change should come from within?","p041","p071",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
80,35,4,12,"Person 1","Yes. I think that is the only way to get lasting long term and meaningful change. We have to help them help themselves","p041","p071",3.3333,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
81,35,4,13,"Person 2","Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this.","p041","p071",2.6667,0,3,2.3333
82,35,4,14,"Person 1","I disagree. With all the corruption it would just be money wasted. We should control the funds and focus more on sending people and material","p041","p071",3.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
83,35,4,15,"Person 2","Yeah but you can not have it both ways, either we send money and get power and control, or we send it no strings attached. So I think there might have to be strings actually, as you reminded me of the corruption.","p041","p071",2.6667,1,2,2.3333
84,35,4,16,"Person 1","Some other questions would be how much money and how long would we have to be involved?","p041","p071",2,1,1,1
85,35,4,17,"Person 2","I think the article said the UN was looking to send $800 million. No more then ten years in my opinion","p041","p071",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
86,35,4,18,"Person 1","I think 10 years is a good figure. But it seems like any problems Haiti has are only made worse by natural disasters. And no one can stop those","p041","p071",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
87,35,4,19,"Person 2","Yes there will always be disasters. Until the core problem of the country is fixed, I think we will always have to be ready to help.","p041","p071",3,1,2,1.6667
88,35,4,20,"Person 1","That might take a lot longer than 10 years. It might be a good idea if the UN established permanent or semi permanent facilitiesc","p041","p071",2,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
89,35,4,21,"Person 2","Yes I think if we could supply them advisers and disaster professionals they could greatly benefit","p041","p071",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.6667
90,35,4,22,"Person 1","True, but who would want to go there long term? I know I wouldn't. It's so far away and so different","p041","p071",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
91,35,4,23,"Person 2","I probably would not. We would have to compensate those individuals well.","p041","p071",2,1.3333,2,2
92,35,4,24,"Person 1","The compensation would have to be high to motivate the right people","p041","p071",2,1,2.6667,2
93,35,4,25,"Person 2","Yeah but I think the fact they would be helping those in need, could also be a motivation","p041","p071",2,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
94,35,4,26,"Person 1","True but would it be enough to keep them from their friends and family for long durations?","p041","p071",2,1,2,1
95,35,4,27,"Person 2","Probably different for each person, I am optimistic though.","p041","p071",2,0.3333,2,1.6667
96,35,4,28,"Person 1","Yes I can see that. It has been nice chatting. We have to bring our conversation to a conclusion","p041","p071",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
97,35,4,29,"Person 2","Yes this has been enjoyable. bye","p041","p071",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
98,35,4,30,"Person 1","goodbye","p041","p071",1,1,0.6667,1
99,35,5,0,"Person 1","Please, what did you think about the article","p022","p010",1,1,1,1.3333
100,35,5,1,"Person 2","It's very sad.   I can't believe in the 21st century that people are still so slow in helping third world countries or even in the US when New Orleans was destroyed.   It makes no sense.","p022","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
101,35,5,2,"Person 1","It's terrible. I feel bad for all the people left without shelter!","p022","p010",4,2,4.3333,3
102,35,5,3,"Person 2","And food - you can get by in Haiti without much shelter but one must have clean water and food to live","p022","p010",3,1.6667,3.3333,2
103,35,5,4,"Person 1","Agree. Have you ever been in a hurricane?","p022","p010",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
104,35,5,5,"Person 2","I have not but I have been to Haiti on a mission trip.   Such wonderful kind people.","p022","p010",3.3333,0.3333,3.3333,2.6667
105,35,5,6,"Person 1","Wow, Haiti sounds awesome. I'm from Florida so there's lots of them here and they are all nice.","p022","p010",3,0.3333,2,3.3333
106,35,5,7,"Person 2","That would be so much stress.   I live in Colorado so just beautiful white snow.","p022","p010",2.3333,1,1,3.3333
107,35,5,8,"Person 1","It's pretty stressful when hurricanes hit. I once stayed for one even though we were supposed to evacuate, nobody was hurt but it was a scary experience","p022","p010",3,2,1.6667,3
108,35,5,9,"Person 2","I have been near tornadoes and they look bad enough.  I can't imagine a hurricane.","p022","p010",2.6667,2,1.6667,3
109,35,5,10,"Person 1","It's scary because all you can do is hide in your home hoping it passes by without doing much damage. I hope the people affected by the hurricane are getting help right now.","p022","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
110,35,5,11,"Person 2","I follow college basketball like a crazy person.   Skal Labiesse was trapped in the hurricane in this article.   His whole home collapsed on him and he was covered with rock and materials for three days.   His story is so frightening.   He thought he was dying","p022","p010",4.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3
111,35,5,12,"Person 1","Yeah it's definitely very different. The air pressure feels different when you're in a hurricane. All you hear are sounds of things ripping apart ourside","p022","p010",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
112,35,5,13,"Person 2","Wow.   Are you on the gulf or the Atlantic?","p022","p010",2.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
113,35,5,14,"Person 1","Atlantic, i've lived in Florida for about 8 years now and luckyily haven't had any MAJOR hurricane yet.","p022","p010",2,1,0.6667,2.3333
114,35,5,15,"Person 2","That's good to hear.   Haiti has such a corrupt government - I wonder how much their President stole from the people so he had fun for a long time.","p022","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
115,35,5,16,"Person 1","I didn't think of that. That's why i don't even donate but i feel bad because i can't help","p022","p010",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
116,35,5,17,"Person 2","It's gotten to that point everywhere unless a church is doing all the work.   American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, United Way - hardly any goes to the people or cause you are donating to - it's all taken in outlandish salaries of that charity","p022","p010",3,2,1.6667,2.3333

190,213,9,4,"Person 1","Exactly. He was so young too. I can't even fathom losing a son so young. Parents should never have to bury their children but you hear it happening almost every day these days.","p048","p022",3.6667,2,4,3

194,213,9,8,"Person 1","No, it's really not. You take each day for granted. I am in a season of my life where I just keep wishing the days away and hoping time speeds up. But it's no way to live because you miss the small moments!","p048","p022",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3.6667
195,213,9,9,"Person 2","I totally agree. If you don't mind me asking , why are you hoping time speeds up?","p048","p022",1.6667,1,2.3333,2

200,213,9,14,"Person 1","Yes, that would be a hard loss. Unexpected deaths are obviously way harder.","p048","p022",3,2,4,2.3333
201,213,9,15,"Person 2","True. I heard of KINDA a similar incident with a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. It's all so terrible","p048","p022",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
202,213,9,16,"Person 1","Oh man. Especially when someone does it for a living, it's hard to have any sort of life altering injury. It definitely crushes their spirits.","p048","p022",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
203,213,9,17,"Person 2","For sure! It's very heartbreaking. Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p048","p022",2.6667,1.3333,3.6667,1.3333

207,213,10,2,"Person 1","Right. I can't imagine being his family either.  To see their child go like that after being so successful has to sting.","p063","p039",3.3333,2,3.3333,2

210,213,10,5,"Person 2","I remember when this happened saw it on ESPN but I think it was night","p063","p039",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
211,213,10,6,"Person 1","At least it was probably instant.  They probably had no idea the rocks were there and absolutely flew into them without any chance to realize what was going on.","p063","p039",2.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2
212,213,10,7,"Person 2","yea it would suck to be in a coma","p063","p039",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
213,213,10,8,"Person 1","Lol I think it would suck more to come out of a coma.  When you're in it you have no idea.  I would hate coming out of one and realizing you lost a month of your life or something.","p063","p039",3,2,2.6667,2.6667
214,213,10,9,"Person 2","I wonder what you think about in a coma","p063","p039",1.3333,1,2,2
215,213,10,10,"Person 1","I feel like there's lots of stories out there about people saying they saw everything but from the third person perspective or things like that. Other people say it was just the deepest sleep they've ever had.","p063","p039",1.6667,1,1,1.3333
216,213,10,11,"Person 2","the mind is a trip","p063","p039",1.6667,1,1,1.6667
217,213,10,12,"Person 1","For real.  Obviously they don't know everything about it, but it blows my mind when I watch docs or something where people are breaking down the parts of the brain... Like, how the fuck did we figure all this stuff out...","p063","p039",3.3333,0.6667,1,1.6667
218,213,10,13,"Person 2","yea I love watching that stuff I'm the only one who's not a doctor in my family but I'm still in the medical field we used to have some real interesting dinner convos","p063","p039",2.3333,0.3333,1,2.3333

222,213,10,17,"Person 2","Yea my job is to get all the instruments ready and basically be an extra pair of hands for the surgeon handing him all the instruments and helping him with the surgery. A good surgical tech knows the surgery just as well as the surgeon so he/she never has to ask for anything you should anticipate it","p063","p039",2.3333,0.6667,0.6667,4
223,213,10,18,"Person 1","Yeah I here ya, probably makes the operation flow a lot smoother when the surgeon asks for a tool and you're not fumblefuckin around looking to find the blahblahmeter.","p063","p039",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
224,213,10,19,"Person 2","yea they get super pissed if you waste time each minute counts","p063","p039",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333

227,213,10,22,"Person 1","Yikes.  Well if Jose would've survived he probaby would have needed at least an 8 hour spinal surgery.","p063","p039",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667

240,78,11,10,"Person 1","Maybe my cousin is just a sociopath. I hope those kids that got out find good jobs in the future.","p022","p039",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,3
241,78,11,11,"Person 2","yea its hard because people are scared to hire people who were in the system even if they change","p022","p039",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
242,78,11,12,"Person 1","I think that if i owned a business, i would definitely think twice about a person who served time","p022","p039",3,2,1.6667,3
243,78,11,13,"Person 2","yea me too","p022","p039",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
244,78,11,14,"Person 1","How would you feel about someone in your family marrying a person that went to jail before?","p022","p039",2,1,0.6667,1
245,78,11,15,"Person 2","it would depend on the crime I guess","p022","p039",2,1,1.3333,2.3333
246,78,11,16,"Person 1","What if it's minor like stealing, but has done it many times.","p022","p039",2,1,0.6667,1.3333
247,78,11,17,"Person 2","I don't know about multiple offenses maybe if it was a max of 2 times","p022","p039",2,1.3333,1,2
248,78,11,18,"Person 1","Very interesting! Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p039",2.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
249,78,11,19,"Person 2","you too bye","p022","p039",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
250,78,12,0,"Person 1","What did you think about this article","p019","p062",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
251,78,12,1,"Person 2","I always think stories of foster kids are pretty sad.","p019","p062",1.6667,2,3.6667,3.6667
252,78,12,2,"Person 1","I agree... it's such a bad system sometimes and it breaks my heart, cause they are kids","p019","p062",2.3333,2,3.6667,3.6667
253,78,12,3,"Person 2","Of course the kids make matters worse with delinquency, but that's not unexpected behavior considering their experiences.","p019","p062",2.6667,1.3333,4,2.3333
254,78,12,4,"Person 1","Agreed, I'm sure he would be less likely to do that if he  had grown up in more stable conditions. It seems a lot of times the foster care system puts them in a situation that is just as bad or worse then where they wer ebefore","p019","p062",2,1.3333,3.3333,3
255,78,12,5,"Person 2","Yes, although even in good situations it sometimes doesn't work.  I knew an adopted boy and girl who'd come from a very violent background.  They destroyed the adoptive family they were brought into.  The damage had already been done to them as people.","p019","p062",1.6667,2,3,2.6667
256,78,12,6,"Person 1","Oh that's so sad... My neighbors did foster care a lot, and they were a great family. but man some of the kids you could tell had been through some shit and they were so angry.","p019","p062",3.3333,1.3333,4.3333,3
257,78,12,7,"Person 2","Yeah, bless the people who are willing to do that.  And I'm sure most have good intentions.  But it's definitely a tough situation for everyone.","p019","p062",3,0,4.3333,3
258,78,12,8,"Person 1","Agreed, I'm sure it would put a strain on any family or couple, especially if the kids are a handful","p019","p062",2.3333,0.6667,3.3333,3
259,78,12,9,"Person 2","At least there was something of a silver lining in this story.","p019","p062",1.6667,0,3,2.6667
260,78,12,10,"Person 1","for sure! I just wish he could have been helped out more in the process, or for it to be easier on him","p019","p062",2.3333,0.6667,3,3
261,78,12,11,"Person 2","Yes, although I'd also go back to the mother and say the problem starts there. The mother (and probably father) were the first to let the kids down.","p019","p062",3,1.3333,3.6667,2
262,78,12,12,"Person 1","Agreed.... I can't imagine being that kind of parent. i don't get people who are. But there seems to be so many","p019","p062",3.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
263,78,12,13,"Person 2","Yes, unfortunately.  It's very easy to have children but not so easy to raise them well.","p019","p062",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
264,78,12,14,"Person 1","For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids","p019","p062",2.3333,2,2,2
265,78,12,15,"Person 2","Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do.","p019","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,3
266,78,12,16,"Person 1","For sure... it seems everyone has parent problems, but then seem to end up parenting the same way","p019","p062",2,0,3,2
267,78,12,17,"Person 2","It's a strange phenomenon.  At least to me.  But we're often more creatures of habit and genetics and convenience than of thoughtful consideration and values.","p019","p062",2,0,3.3333,2.3333
268,78,12,18,"Person 1","That is a great way to phrase it... It's very interesting for sure. Especially when you have 18+years to change","p019","p062",2,0,3,1.6667
269,78,12,19,"Person 2","Do you have any children?","p019","p062",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
270,78,12,20,"Person 1","I don't, but my husband and I are trying","p019","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,3
271,78,12,21,"Person 2","Sounds fun.  I hope you're successful and you, your husband, and future children are all thankful for it.  I don't have kids and figure it's best for all parties involved that it stays that way.","p019","p062",2.6667,0,1.3333,2.6667
272,78,12,22,"Person 1","thank you! haha my husband felt that way for a while... It's scary for  sure the thought of bringing another human into this world","p019","p062",3,0.6667,1.3333,3
273,78,12,23,"Person 2","Yes,it's certainly a big responsibility.  But I'm sure you'll do fine.","p019","p062",2.6667,0,1,2.3333
274,78,12,24,"Person 1","Thank you! I sure will try haha","p019","p062",2.3333,0,0.6667,2.3333

278,78,13,1,"Person 2","this was so sad i never really thought of kids in foster care and how hard it was","p029","p068",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
279,78,13,2,"Person 1","It is sad for them, no child should have to endure all that","p029","p068",3,2,3.6667,2
280,78,13,3,"Person 2","agreed and not there fault they had behavioral issues","p029","p068",2.6667,2,3,2
281,78,13,4,"Person 1","well, yes and no.  we all have personal responsibility for our choices in my opinion.  regardless of circumstance","p029","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
282,78,13,5,"Person 2","They needed more direction and structure they didnt get in the system","p029","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
283,78,13,6,"Person 1","yes they definitely did, it failed them","p029","p068",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,1.6667

289,78,13,12,"Person 1","yes it needs help, but i think there is a lack of good foster parents","p029","p068",3,1.3333,3.3333,2
290,78,13,13,"Person 2","yeah i know alot just do it for tax and write offs and are horrible caretakers to the kids","p029","p068",3.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667

298,78,14,1,"Person 2","yeah, lots of ups and downs in that one","p054","p030",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.3333
299,78,14,2,"Person 1","It sounds like the system failed him at an early age","p054","p030",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
300,78,14,3,"Person 2","unfortunately, i think stories like this are all too common with children who go through the foster system.","p054","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
301,78,14,4,"Person 1","For sure. Many fall  through the cracks and its so sad.","p054","p030",3,2,3,2.3333

304,78,14,7,"Person 2","astronomical. Do you have any thoughts on how the foster system could be improved?","p054","p030",2.6667,1,2,2
305,78,14,8,"Person 1","I'd say have more oversight of individual cases. So many children arent getting the attention on their cases that they need. Do you have any suggestions?","p054","p030",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
306,78,14,9,"Person 2","I agree, I also think that counseling services should be provided by the state","p054","p030",2.6667,0,3,2.3333
307,78,14,10,"Person 1","Absolutely. And also some sort of self sufficiency classes for those who are about to age out of the system","p054","p030",3,0,2.6667,2.6667
308,78,14,11,"Person 2","I think we could all benefit from self sufficiency/life skills classes as teenagers.","p054","p030",2.3333,0,2.6667,2.6667
309,78,14,12,"Person 1","My school had them every week and I loved it. Learned a lot of life skills","p054","p030",2.6667,0,1,3
310,78,14,13,"Person 2","What kind of skills did you learn?","p054","p030",1,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
311,78,14,14,"Person 1","Sewing, vehicle maintenance, budgeting, childcare, basic home repairs, tax basics, etc.","p054","p030",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,3.6667
312,78,14,15,"Person 2","interesting, I don't think my high school offered classes like that. We had home economics, but that was primarily cooking and cleaning.","p054","p030",2,0,0.6667,3
313,78,14,16,"Person 1","I think all schools should offer classes like that. Theyre very beneficial","p054","p030",2.3333,0,0.6667,3.3333
314,78,14,17,"Person 2","Agreed. What did you think of the sibling that eventually got his masters and now helps kids in similar situations?","p054","p030",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
315,78,14,18,"Person 1","I think its amazing how he turned his life around. A true inspiration","p054","p030",2.6667,0,3.3333,2.3333

318,78,15,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the article?","p022","p019",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
319,78,15,1,"Person 2","I think it's sad that a kid would have to go through all that...","p022","p019",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
320,78,15,2,"Person 1","It's terrible! I feel so bad for the kid because he should be in school.","p022","p019",4,2,3.6667,2
321,78,15,3,"Person 2","Agreed, he should just be allowed to be a kid and not have to deal with all that","p022","p019",2.6667,1,3.6667,2
322,78,15,4,"Person 1","He probably was terrified and is going to be scarred for life now..","p022","p019",3.6667,2,4.3333,2.3333
323,78,15,5,"Person 2","Oh yah, he'll definitly have the trauma of it all to deal with the rest of his life","p022","p019",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
324,78,15,6,"Person 1","Do you think jail can really change the kid for the better?","p022","p019",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
325,78,15,7,"Person 2","I think he needs therapy and guidance and  a stable home more so than punishment/jail","p022","p019",2,0.6667,3.3333,3
326,78,15,8,"Person 1","I agree. I have a cousin that went to jail before for stealing and he's the same.","p022","p019",2.3333,1.3333,2,3.3333
327,78,15,9,"Person 2","Childhood tramua?","p022","p019",0.6667,1.3333,1,1
328,78,15,10,"Person 1","Pretty much. He just hasn't improved for the better and jail didn't really help him","p022","p019",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
329,78,15,11,"Person 2","Yah and I bet that is the case for a lot of people... how sad","p022","p019",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
330,78,15,12,"Person 1","The kid should be out making friends and playing video games.. not rotting in jail","p022","p019",3,1.3333,3.3333,2
331,78,15,13,"Person 2","I agree... It's so sad because he has already missed out on so so much of his childhood, and had it be horrible, and now this. He just needs a break and someone who actually cares about him","p022","p019",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
332,78,15,14,"Person 1","Hopefully he finds a girl he can marry that cares about him because his family doesnt","p022","p019",2.6667,0,3.3333,2.3333
333,78,15,15,"Person 2","I hope so too, and that he is able to hold a healthy relationship","p022","p019",2.6667,0,3,2
334,78,15,16,"Person 1","It just makes you wonder how many other children are out there being put in cells..","p022","p019",2,1.3333,3,2
335,78,15,17,"Person 2","Probably way too many","p022","p019",2.3333,1,3,1.3333

339,336,16,1,"Person 2","I feel bad for the people and the wild life.","p043","p035",3,2,4.6667,3.3333
340,336,16,2,"Person 1","Yeah for sure. The people are going to get all sorts of health problems and the animals are so desperate for food that they are attacking humans.","p043","p035",3.6667,2,4.6667,2.3333
341,336,16,3,"Person 2","I can not believe how little they said they are going to pay the people for lost of land.","p043","p035",4,2,4,2.6667
342,336,16,4,"Person 1","Yeah, it did seem little but Indians don't really make much money daily, compared to western countries.","p043","p035",2,1.6667,3,2.3333
343,336,16,5,"Person 2","That is true. I wonder what other animals besides the elephants are effected?","p043","p035",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
344,336,16,6,"Person 1","I imagine it's every animal in the surroundings. It's just that only elephants are big and strong enough to do something about it.","p043","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
345,336,16,7,"Person 2","It has to be really bad growing up next to the coal mine with the bad air quality.","p043","p035",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
346,336,16,8,"Person 1","Yeah and the lack of water too. They spoke about their wells drying up.","p043","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
347,336,16,9,"Person 2","Nothing seemed to be very regulated.","p043","p035",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
348,336,16,10,"Person 1","Maybe it's a matter of corruption? Since the officials didn't even make good on their promises regarding money for the land and work for one of the landowners sons.","p043","p035",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
349,336,16,11,"Person 2","Corruption and greed, but that is not just in India.","p043","p035",3,2,1.6667,2.3333
350,336,16,12,"Person 1","True, so many other places mine coal still though, including America. Do you think our coal mines are this bad?","p043","p035",2,1.6667,1.3333,2

353,336,16,15,"Person 2","The way the coal in mined.","p043","p035",1,1,1,2
354,336,16,16,"Person 1","That's good. One of the worst parts of that article was reading about the white ash covering everything. Reading about it might've been enough to give me cancer.","p043","p035",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
355,336,16,17,"Person 2","Yeah, the woman losing her son was bad too.","p043","p035",3.3333,2,4,2.6667

357,336,16,19,"Person 2","Sadly, I think it present day.","p043","p035",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
358,336,16,20,"Person 1","That's sad. I've read recently that India has started more recycling and other measures to take care of the enviroment.","p043","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,3.3333
359,336,16,21,"Person 2","India is a big country. So it probably has good parts when it comes to environmental protections.","p043","p035",2,0.6667,1,2.3333
360,336,16,22,"Person 1","Yeah, it's likely the cities that will start with the new reforms.","p043","p035",1,0.6667,1,1.6667
361,336,16,23,"Person 2","The story was about capitalism as much it was about environmentalism","p043","p035",1.6667,1,1,2
362,336,16,24,"Person 1","True. Squeeze all the money you can out of the land without caring about the people, animals or general environment until it's too late.","p043","p035",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
363,336,16,25,"Person 2","You asked about mines in America. I believe this is how they were in the 1800s","p043","p035",1.3333,1,1,2.3333
364,336,16,26,"Person 1","Yeah and it was probably children working in there too.","p043","p035",2,2,2.3333,2
365,336,16,27,"Person 2","many people died because of black lung.","p043","p035",1,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667
366,336,16,28,"Person 1","It's a terrible way to die too. So much suffering. I wonder if the mine workers in India are suffering from that too?","p043","p035",4,1.6667,4,3
367,336,16,29,"Person 2","I would think that they are.","p043","p035",1,1,3,2
368,336,16,30,"Person 1","It was nice talking to you about this unfortunate topic. Have a great day!","p043","p035",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
369,336,16,31,"Person 2","You have a great day too.","p043","p035",1.3333,0,1,1.6667
370,336,16,32,"Person 1","bye","p043","p035",1,1,1,1
371,336,16,33,"Person 2","bye","p043","p035",1,1,1,1
372,336,17,0,"Person 1","Hello. The situation in India is really terrible","p037","p023",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
373,336,17,1,"Person 2","Tell me about it. What a shame that the government of India isn't taking action. It's all about profit to them it seems.","p037","p023",3,1.3333,4,2
374,336,17,2,"Person 1","Apparently. The most worrisome part of the situation is the fact that they barely compensate the victims","p037","p023",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
375,336,17,3,"Person 2","It's such a shame and a human rights abuse. Every living creature for that matter has a basic right to clean air and water. I couldn't imagine how bad it must be living near one of those mines.","p037","p023",3.3333,1.6667,4,3
376,336,17,4,"Person 1","Indeed. What do you think can be done on the part of the citizens in order to draw attention of the international communities?","p037","p023",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
377,336,17,5,"Person 2","Any change with government happens when people join together en mass. They need to be protesting outside of every politicians office. They should also spread this story to the international community to publicly shame their officials. Do you have any ideas of what can be done?","p037","p023",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,3
378,336,17,6,"Person 1","In all honesty, I have no idea.","p037","p023",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
379,336,17,7,"Person 2","I can think of how in the US change was created with the civil rights movement, and the women's movement when people stood together. I think that because people like us know about the story we can help by sharing this information on social media. We can be the media for them. But what can be done about the poor elephants? They have lost their homes because of the forest's being destroyed.","p037","p023",3.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
380,336,17,8,"Person 1","It's left for their government to decide","p037","p023",2,0.6667,0.6667,1
381,336,17,9,"Person 2","Ultimately yes. So it's up to everyone to make sure their government works in their best interest. Some people not even receiving compensation was terrible, but what about the kids who lost their lives? No amount of money can replace life.","p037","p023",3.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
382,336,17,10,"Person 1","True. It's really pathetic","p037","p023",3,1.3333,3,2
383,336,17,11,"Person 2","There should be some sort of a program that helps these elephants get transported to a place where their homes won't be destroyed. Do you know of any charities that could help?","p037","p023",2.6667,0.6667,3,2
384,336,17,12,"Person 1","Nope. I doubt if the government will allow that.","p037","p023",2,1.3333,0.6667,1.6667
385,336,17,13,"Person 2","You really don't think they would allow international help? I will pose the question... What would you do if this were happening in your hometown?","p037","p023",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
386,336,17,14,"Person 1","The government in India is corrupt. They are involved in the illegal trade of ivory. They won't allow any external body to interfere with their business","p037","p023",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
387,336,17,15,"Person 2","You make a really good point. I wasn't thinking about that.","p037","p023",2,1,2,1.6667
388,336,17,16,"Person 1","I've read series of disturbing stories about their activities in the illegal trade of ivory","p037","p023",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
389,336,17,17,"Person 2","I've actually heard about that a while ago. Like I stated earlier... They care about profits over people.","p037","p023",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
390,336,17,18,"Person 1","Yeah. It's all about the rupees","p037","p023",2.6667,1.6667,0.6667,1.6667
391,336,17,19,"Person 2","I'm afraid that they will hurt these communities to the point where they create a refugee crisis.","p037","p023",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
392,336,17,20,"Person 1","That's the reality.","p037","p023",2,1.6667,0.6667,1
393,336,17,21,"Person 2","At the very least I wonder if we could donate things like breathing masks? Maybe that could help some to breath a bit better. Or if there is a way to get them clean water delivered.","p037","p023",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
394,336,17,22,"Person 1","That won't be a bad idea. How do \"we\" go about that","p037","p023",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
395,336,17,23,"Person 2","I would imagine that we could set up a GoFundMe campaign. That's definitely one way to go about it.","p037","p023",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
396,336,17,24,"Person 1","There have been several scam cases with GFM","p037","p023",2,2,1.6667,1
397,336,17,25,"Person 2","There are alternative platforms. I would be happy to research them in detail. Charities can be looked into as well.","p037","p023",2.3333,0,0.6667,1.6667
398,336,17,26,"Person 1","That'll be great","p037","p023",2.3333,0,0.6667,1.3333
399,336,17,27,"Person 2","It's the least we can do, and like I said, posting on social media would help raise awareness. I just wish we could wave a wand and these communities would have clean air and water.","p037","p023",3.3333,0.3333,3,2.3333
400,336,17,28,"Person 1","goodbye","p037","p023",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
401,336,17,29,"Person 2","bye","p037","p023",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
402,336,18,0,"Person 1","The effect is terrible","p050","p074",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
403,336,18,1,"Person 2","it is only one of many issues affecting the poorer population, but yea","p050","p074",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
404,336,18,2,"Person 1","I think humans are generally selfish","p050","p074",3,2,2.6667,3.3333
405,336,18,3,"Person 2","the article read mostly of financial and political greed. they just don't care","p050","p074",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
406,336,18,4,"Person 1","Yea, It is sad and pathetic.","p050","p074",3,2,3,2.6667
407,336,18,5,"Person 2","can't even blame the elephants if everything is getting destroyed. agricultural expansion is one and thing, but coal mining adds a lot more of dangerous stuff to the environment","p050","p074",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
408,336,18,6,"Person 1","Yea, the pollution is massive.","p050","p074",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
409,336,18,7,"Person 2","i wonder how far the situation will have to deteriorate for them to be like Oh wait, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.","p050","p074",2,2,2,3
410,336,18,8,"Person 1","I dont see that happening sincerely. The are rich, they can afford moving to another planet!","p050","p074",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
411,336,18,9,"Person 2","what annoys me too is that the people receive promises after the fact of like an elephant incursion, but it is just that, empty promises","p050","p074",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
412,336,18,10,"Person 1","That is what they do. They give false hopes","p050","p074",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
413,336,18,11,"Person 2","the effort to change at the population level needs to be massive","p050","p074",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
414,336,18,12,"Person 1","People should be more orientated.","p050","p074",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
415,336,18,13,"Person 2","there is still some hope. i recall reading a different article, also from India, dealing with a big volunteer effort toward reforestation","p050","p074",2.3333,0,2.6667,3.3333
416,336,18,14,"Person 1","Oh, that is great. Reforestation is a great way...I hope people follow it through","p050","p074",2.6667,0,2.3333,2.6667
417,336,18,15,"Person 2","it was. it took them 15 years, but the new forest is thriving. the issue is the population need to be more conscientious and understand that the benefits might not be seen overnight.","p050","p074",3,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
418,336,18,16,"Person 1","Yea, that is some nice method.","p050","p074",2,0,1.6667,2
419,336,18,17,"Person 2","i'm kind of running out of things to say, and we need at least 15 messages each that are relevant to the articles","p050","p074",1,0.6667,1.6667,2
420,336,18,18,"Person 1","yes...I think finding alternatives to coal is also a great idea","p050","p074",2,0,2,2.3333
421,336,18,19,"Person 2","wind and solar are the first that come to mind","p050","p074",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
422,336,18,20,"Person 1","And nuclear sources..","p050","p074",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2
423,336,18,21,"Person 2","are they capable to handle the necessary infrastructure for that? nobody wants a Chernobyl or Fukushima","p050","p074",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
424,336,18,22,"Person 1","It is good I think.","p050","p074",1.3333,0,1.6667,2.3333
425,336,18,23,"Person 2","they need better overall infrastructure. reaching a lot of these places is hard, if not impossible during some parts of the year","p050","p074",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
426,336,18,24,"Person 1","Yes. can we exchange our byes?","p050","p074",1,0.6667,0.6667,2
427,336,18,25,"Person 2","we are short a few still","p050","p074",1,0.6667,0.6667,1

430,336,19,0,"Person 1","What did you think?","p016","p035",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
431,336,19,1,"Person 2","I can not blame them for wanting to industrialize, but it still horrible.","p016","p035",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
432,336,19,2,"Person 1","Yeah. I wish we had better options than coal. It seems like it's wrecking environments everywhere these days.","p016","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
433,336,19,3,"Person 2","Yeah, the people and animals over there are suffering.","p016","p035",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2
434,336,19,4,"Person 1","For sure. I can't imagine having an elephant burst through my house!","p016","p035",3.6667,2,4,2.6667
435,336,19,5,"Person 2","That would be very scary, then told you will get about 120 dollars for your broken leg.","p016","p035",3,2,4,2
436,336,19,6,"Person 1","Probably wouldn't even pay for a single night's stay in a hospital.","p016","p035",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
437,336,19,7,"Person 2","It sucks that the people who don't even work in the mines are getting such bad lung diseases.","p016","p035",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
438,336,19,8,"Person 1","Yeah. It's bad enough when things like this affect people actually involved, but when you have people getting hurt that weren't even part of it it's just so much worse.","p016","p035",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
439,336,19,9,"Person 2","I wonder if the animals are having lung issues too?","p016","p035",2,1.6667,3,2
440,336,19,10,"Person 1","I wouldn't be surprised; many animals have similar lung structures as humans do. It's probably why the elephants etc. have been in so many altercations lately.","p016","p035",2,1.6667,3,2
441,336,19,11,"Person 2","Like I said, can't get too mad because American used a lot of coal in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s.","p016","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
442,336,19,12,"Person 1","Oh for sure. Many of the appalachian areas, for example, still have serious environmental damages and generational health issues.","p016","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
443,336,19,13,"Person 2","Many of the same areas want to continue mining coals. It sucks that we live in a world where economics out weight health.","p016","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
444,336,19,14,"Person 1","Yeah. Economics & tradition -- many families have been in the business for so long they can't imagine doing anything else. It's their way of life almost more than it is a living.","p016","p035",2,1,2.6667,2.6667
445,336,19,15,"Person 2","I know working in the US mine is a lot safer than the mine in India.","p016","p035",1.3333,0,2.6667,2.3333
446,336,19,16,"Person 1","True true. Do you think we should be investing in finding cleaner forms of energy?","p016","p035",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
447,336,19,17,"Person 2","Yes 100 percent.","p016","p035",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
448,336,19,18,"Person 1","We're in agreement then. Something needs to be done soon before we run out of options & time.","p016","p035",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
449,336,19,19,"Person 2","I agree, but a lot people can not think about the future or other people besides themselves","p016","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
450,336,19,20,"Person 1","\"The tyranny of the immediate,\" as one of my professors once said.","p016","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2

459,336,20,4,"Person 1","yeah the government should do something, it is ridiculous","p029","p019",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
460,336,20,5,"Person 2","Agreed... that is their job afterall","p029","p019",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
461,336,20,6,"Person 1","Yes, at least to make harsher penalties and laws about this","p029","p019",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
462,336,20,7,"Person 2","Yes, to deter it and to show people that it is wrong... It's sad what greed will do to people","p029","p019",3,2,3,1.6667
463,336,20,8,"Person 1","yes all this just to turn a profit, with no regard for lives","p029","p019",2.6667,2,2.6667,2

475,281,21,0,"Person 1","So I thought this was a really tragic and avoidable incident, what did you think","p029","p041",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
476,281,21,1,"Person 2","I was not really bothered, suicides are common","p029","p041",1,2,2,2.6667
477,281,21,2,"Person 1","common?  I guess.  I don't really see it as an everyday occurence but anyhow","p029","p041",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
478,281,21,3,"Person 2","No not everyday but people do it and that is their choice","p029","p041",1,1.6667,2,2
479,281,21,4,"Person 1","Yep, it is definitely their choice.  I still find it sad and very avoidable.  How sad for all their remaining family members.","p029","p041",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
480,281,21,5,"Person 2","I see what you mean but don't you think that being sad is just a waste of time?","p029","p041",1,2,1.6667,2.3333
481,281,21,6,"Person 1","Of course being sad is a waste of time, but it is still appropriate to feel sadness when you hear of a tragedy.  It's not like I'm dressed in black lighting candles and mourning, Jesus Christ.","p029","p041",4,1.3333,3,3
482,281,21,7,"Person 2","Easy now. I did not mean it as a personal attack. It just doesn't make sense to me to be sad for someone who makes a conscious choice to end their own life. It's their choice","p029","p041",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.6667
483,281,21,8,"Person 1","Well then be neutral towards it or happy, that's your right.  I find it sad anytime I hear about a tragedy that happens to others.  I am sad for their family who lost a beloved family member.","p029","p041",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
484,281,21,9,"Person 2","Let me be clear, I would rather no one commit suicide. How do we know that they were beloved? They could have despised each other","p029","p041",1.3333,2,1.3333,3
485,281,21,10,"Person 1","Sure they could have, but surely there was at least one person who appreciated this woman.  The article stated as much.","p029","p041",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
486,281,21,11,"Person 2","A fair point. When you think about it suicide is the easy way out. It is a bit cowardly. Choosing to continue living requires real courage","p029","p041",2,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
487,281,21,12,"Person 1","I agree suicide is extremely cowardly and suicide angers me.  It is a terrible choice for people to make and very selfish bc they are not considering how their actions affect others who are left behind.","p029","p041",4,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
488,281,21,13,"Person 2","We can agree on that. Do you know anyone personally who committed suicide?","p029","p041",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
489,281,21,14,"Person 1","Yes, and dealing with the fallout from it and the years and years of aftermath from that person's loved ones was terrible and very straining on everyone around.  The loved ones are STILL not healed and it has been 13 years","p029","p041",3,1.3333,2.3333,3.6667
490,281,21,15,"Person 2","I got that impression from your responses. Do you think the loved ones deserve treatment or should preventative measures be the answer to suicide?","p029","p041",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
491,281,21,16,"Person 1","Can you clarify your question?  I am not sure I fully understand.  Do you mean grief counseling, or what preventative measures are you referring to?  Like should more have been done to try to help the person to start with?","p029","p041",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.6667
492,281,21,17,"Person 2","Hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, or even depriving someone of their freedom temporarily to ensure they do not take their life","p029","p041",1,0.6667,2.3333,2
493,281,21,18,"Person 1","I think those are reasonable steps to take in some cases but in others it might just make things worse.  I really don't know the answer to that.  If someone is that determined to take their own life it seems they will do it no matter what.  What do you think?  I don't think any of that stuff would have helped int he situation I'm referring to.  But who knows.","p029","p041",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
494,281,21,19,"Person 2","What do you think causes suicide? Most animals have such a strong will to live. What causes people to abandon or ignore that innate drive?","p029","p041",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
495,281,21,20,"Person 1","That's an interesting point about animals.  We don't see them giving up and killing themselves.  Fascinating question, I have no idea what it is about humans.  Maybe it has just become a part of our culture?  Like if the first animal did it then others would follow?  No clues.  What do you think","p029","p041",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
496,281,21,21,"Person 2","I am not sure myself. Most animals also do not have complex social structures and constructs like humans. I am sure that with those stark differences it would be good place to start the investigation.","p029","p041",1,1.3333,2,1.6667
497,281,21,22,"Person 1","Yes I wonder if it has ever been formally studied","p029","p041",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
498,281,21,23,"Person 2","I was wondering that myself. I think the best animals to study would be primates. I know chimpanzees can suffer from depression but I am not sure whether or not they commit suicide","p029","p041",1,1,1.6667,1.6667
499,281,21,24,"Person 1","OH yeah, really good point.  That would be very interesting to find out.  I guess it would be possible that they could because they do a lot of things that we do.","p029","p041",2,0,1.6667,1.3333
500,281,21,25,"Person 2","True, but they also don't do a lot of things we do and I am not sure whether or not suicide is in the Do or Don't category.","p029","p041",1,1,2,1.3333
501,281,21,26,"Person 1","yeah exactly.  It is probably in the don't category.  I guess I could see them like refusing to eat or drink more than bringing a knife to their wrist.","p029","p041",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
502,281,21,27,"Person 2","Refusing food and sexual gratification are some of the things chimpanzees do when they are depressed. Similar symptoms in humans. If they were to commit suicide how do you think they would go about doing it?","p029","p041",0.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
503,281,21,28,"Person 1","I would think it would be passive, such as just refusing food and drink until they can't survive.  But maybe the urge to survive would override their depression?  Hard to say.  This has been an interesting conversation and I think we are at 15 messages so I will say goodbye for now and hope you have a great day","p029","p041",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
504,281,21,29,"Person 2","Yes very interesting. I hope you have a good day as well.","p029","p041",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
505,281,21,30,"Person 1","goodbye","p029","p041",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
506,281,21,31,"Person 2","bye","p029","p041",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
507,281,22,0,"Person 1","I found the article to be sad.","p046","p035",3,2,2.3333,3
508,281,22,1,"Person 2","Me too, depression is a real issue.","p046","p035",3,2,3,3
509,281,22,2,"Person 1","It is and it is so difficult for people to seek help.","p046","p035",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
510,281,22,3,"Person 2","Yeah that is true, I think she wanted help but the system failed her.","p046","p035",3,2,3.6667,3
511,281,22,4,"Person 1","Yeah, it did, I feel so bad for her family.","p046","p035",3.6667,2,4.3333,3
512,281,22,5,"Person 2","It made me think that money and frame does not matter when it comes to depression","p046","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
513,281,22,6,"Person 1","Considering how many famous people seem to go through that, yeah it doesn't seem to matter.","p046","p035",2,2,3.3333,2.3333
514,281,22,7,"Person 2","I wonder if being famous adds more pressure and makes a person depressed?","p046","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
515,281,22,8,"Person 1","I guess it could, especially if people have to put up a happy face for the public.","p046","p035",1.6667,1.3333,3,3
516,281,22,9,"Person 2","She should have never been left alone.","p046","p035",3,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
517,281,22,10,"Person 1","Yeah, but I think it is difficult to know what to do when someone you love is going through things that you don't understand.","p046","p035",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,3
518,281,22,11,"Person 2","That is true, but they knew she was having thoughts of killing herself.","p046","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
519,281,22,12,"Person 1","Yeah, but maybe they thought that if they hovered too much, she would feel even worse, I don't know.","p046","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
520,281,22,13,"Person 2","I guess that is why they have professionals. It is a hard subject.","p046","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
521,281,22,14,"Person 1","It is something that people don't know much about especially considering how people ignored or locked away people who went through those things in the past.","p046","p035",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
522,281,22,15,"Person 2","I agree, most people see it was weakness and do not understand what is going on.","p046","p035",2.3333,2,3,2
523,281,22,16,"Person 1","Yeah and they tend to shame people who seek help.","p046","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
524,281,22,17,"Person 2","Or tell them how to deal with it.","p046","p035",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
525,281,22,18,"Person 1","Yeah, I don't know why that is. People have no problem seeking help when it comes to physical problems like a broken arm, but when it comes to mental problems forget about it.","p046","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
526,281,22,19,"Person 2","I believe it comes down to people not wanting to be seen as weak. I do not think most people think about depression as chemicals in the brain.","p046","p035",1.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
527,281,22,20,"Person 1","I think that is better than it used to be.","p046","p035",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,3
528,281,22,21,"Person 2","Yes, there is a lot more awareness today.","p046","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.6667
529,281,22,22,"Person 1","Yes, and people are being more understanding about it.","p046","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
530,281,22,23,"Person 2","Going back to what you said earlier. I feel bad for anybody family that has to go though this.","p046","p035",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
531,281,22,24,"Person 1","Yeah, it is has so be so hard for them.","p046","p035",2.6667,2,4.3333,2.6667
532,281,22,25,"Person 2","It would be the questions about what should you have done.","p046","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
533,281,22,26,"Person 1","Yeah, and it probably doesn't stop after somebody kills themselves. They probably still go through that their whole lives, what could they have done differently.","p046","p035",3.6667,2,4,2
534,281,22,27,"Person 2","The internet makes it better and worst.","p046","p035",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
535,281,22,28,"Person 1","Oh yeah, so many hateful people who don't care who they hurt.","p046","p035",3,2,3,2.3333
536,281,22,29,"Person 2","Well, hopeful everybody gets the help they need.","p046","p035",2.6667,0.3333,3,2.6667
537,281,22,30,"Person 1","I hope so.","p046","p035",2.3333,0.3333,3,3
538,281,22,31,"Person 2","nice chatting with you.","p046","p035",1.6667,0,0.6667,1.3333
539,281,22,32,"Person 1","same to you, goodbye","p046","p035",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
540,281,22,33,"Person 2","bye","p046","p035",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
541,281,23,0,"Person 1","Hey there, this article is pretty morbid. It really hits home for me though since I've dealt with this subject before.","p007","p059",4,2,4,3
542,281,23,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I thought it was very troubling because of the number of times she went for help, and she was always just turned away, essentially.","p007","p059",4,2,3,2
543,281,23,2,"Person 1","Yea suicide is no joke. It took me a couple of years before I received the help I needed and still it was a struggle. I feel so bad that this poor woman didn't get help. It's really messed up.","p007","p059",4,2,4,4
544,281,23,3,"Person 2","That's really sad to hear that it took that long. I'm not surprised at all, but it's ridiculous that mental health issues aren't treated as seriously as other medical issues since they can be just as fatal.","p007","p059",4,2,4,3
545,281,23,4,"Person 1","Exactly. Plus it really really hurts when people like, look at you as less of a person for having these issues.","p007","p059",4,2,4,4
546,281,23,5,"Person 2","Yeah, there is definitely an incredible stigma around it, treated as a weakness rather than a health issue. Can see that in this article too, a constant attitude of \"you're all right, go home.\" Until the worst happens, then they act surprised.","p007","p059",4,2,3,3
547,281,23,6,"Person 1","I always hated it when people told me that. Especially family members. Never had a doctor say that though. Must've been so so rough for this woman.","p007","p059",3,2,4,4
548,281,23,7,"Person 2","Yeah, if you can't get help from doctors, who can you get help from? I definitely have heard stories like this before though, since mental health care is so overstressed and understaffed, people who aren't considered 'in immediate danger' just get sent home.","p007","p059",3,2,4,2
549,281,23,8,"Person 1","It's a shame and just messed up. I can't imagine the extent of the dread she felt. Like I've been there, but for so many repeated attempts to get help, just to be turned away.. that'll mess you up so much more.","p007","p059",3,2,4,4
550,281,23,9,"Person 2","Right, because I imagine she felt hopeless or unimportant. I guess the question is how things can be improved in the mental health care system?","p007","p059",2,2,4,2
551,281,23,10,"Person 1","Honestly, the first step is that people just need to take these things seriously. And insurance companies need to start covering treatments. It took me forever to find a decent psych. And of course insurance doesn't cover it. It's messed up. It all comes down to money these days I think.","p007","p059",3,2,4,4
552,281,23,11,"Person 2","Yeah, I think it would take a generational change, like starting with education in schools about mental health care and that it's just like any other illness that needs to be respected and understood.","p007","p059",2,2,2,3
553,281,23,12,"Person 1","For sure. Through my experience I find that it is older people that are the most..uh.. skeptical when it comes to topics/illnesses like these.","p007","p059",2,2,3,3
554,281,23,13,"Person 2","Yeah, they were raised with a \"suck it up\" attitude and people with more severe mental illness were hidden away or sent away. I don't know how much can be done about people like them, would be best to focus efforts on the young and then try to change society from the bottom.","p007","p059",2,2,2,3
555,281,23,14,"Person 1","Oh man the amount of times I heard \"suck it up\" or \" you have no reason to be depressed.\" That messed me up bad.","p007","p059",4,2,3,4
556,281,23,15,"Person 2","I'm sorry that happened to you. It's so ignorant. We definitely need education campaigns and PSAs to try and educate people.","p007","p059",4,2,3,2
557,281,23,16,"Person 1","For sure. It's kinda messed up when your own family is ignorant to your blatantly obvious issues. Which ties back into that article. I can't even inagine what it feels like for a doctor to just tell you to get over it. That's like going to the police to report a major crime and they just say \"deal with it yourself.\"","p007","p059",3,2,3,4
558,281,23,17,"Person 2","Yeah I feel like that whole system needs a massive overhaul. Like that's their government system so they need to be extra accountable over there.","p007","p059",3,2,4,3
559,281,23,18,"Person 1","Yea and you'd think that they would be. But of course healthcare takes a backseat to like idk.. butter knife licenses or something pointless. On a side note though.. drowning in the ocean must be one of the worst ways to go. Like thats prolonged panic and suffering before lights out. Legit sounds absolutely horrible.","p007","p059",3,2,3,3
560,281,23,19,"Person 2","Yeah, she took one of the worst ways out. She must have been desperate.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
561,281,23,20,"Person 1","For sure. You have to be really desperate to put yourself through that. I'm glad I never hit that point; I'd rather it be quick if it was gonna happen. But lord, that woman's death was so needless. It did not need to happen and the fact that help was refused is so disgusting. I wonder if those doctors even felt remorse about it.","p007","p059",2,2,3,4
562,281,23,21,"Person 2","I feel like it probably happens a lot so they might be numb to it.","p007","p059",3,2,2,2
563,281,23,22,"Person 1","Ah yea they probably deal with death all the time. Didn't think about that.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
564,281,23,23,"Person 2","It's something that needs to be investigated by people above them though, like by politicians etc, they need new directives to properly handle things.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
565,281,23,24,"Person 1","For real. But will they actually do anything is the real question. I'm not sure if half of them take mental issues seriously either.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
566,281,23,25,"Person 2","I wonder if in that particular case, in the UK, if it will help that it was someone involved with the news media. Like it might make the media pay more attention to it and they'll get more pressure because of that.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
567,281,23,26,"Person 1","That is a good point. Sometimes it does take a tragedy from someone famous to get the ball rolling. Kinda sad that it does take that though to be honest.","p007","p059",3,2,1,2
568,281,23,27,"Person 2","Yep, I feel like that's typical though, and we just need to work with it.","p007","p059",2,2,2,2
569,281,23,28,"Person 1","As with most things in our lives I suppose.","p007","p059",2,1,2,2
570,281,23,29,"Person 2","Yeah. If the media puts pressure, that might actually cause some change, even if it's sad that that is what it takes. It's better than nothing. Could be the start of a good education campaign.","p007","p059",1,2,2,3
571,281,23,30,"Person 1","And honestly that is what we need. Just some good education to get people to realize that this stuff is serious. Well anyway, it's been a lovely chat with you Random Turker. Here's hoping the rest of the work day goes smoothly :)","p007","p059",2,0,3,2
572,281,23,31,"Person 2","For sure. Have a good rest of your day. :)","p007","p059",2,0,1,1
573,281,23,32,"Person 1","bye","p007","p059",1,1,0,1
574,281,23,33,"Person 2","goodbye","p007","p059",1,1,0,1
575,281,24,0,"Person 1","Hello","p025","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
576,281,24,1,"Person 2","How you doing?","p025","p050",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
577,281,24,2,"Person 1","Good, how are you?","p025","p050",1.6667,0,0.6667,1.6667
578,281,24,3,"Person 2","Well, Very sad story I must confess","p025","p050",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
579,281,24,4,"Person 1","Yeah I have to agree. Stories about suicide are always sad.","p025","p050",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
580,281,24,5,"Person 2","It was totally avoidable...the woman called for help","p025","p050",3,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
581,281,24,6,"Person 1","Yeha. Even more than that she was at the recovery center and they let her go.","p025","p050",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
582,281,24,7,"Person 2","Depression is real. I mean, she is rich and had it all","p025","p050",3.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
583,281,24,8,"Person 1","Yea it really shows that anybody can be affected by depression. It doesn't mather how much money you have.","p025","p050",3,1.6667,3.3333,3
584,281,24,9,"Person 2","That is scary...","p025","p050",3.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
585,281,24,10,"Person 1","I agree. Do you think the doctors that let her go should face any consequences?","p025","p050",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
586,281,24,11,"Person 2","Yeah, he should. They took the oath to protect them","p025","p050",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
587,281,24,12,"Person 1","I think they should do a thorough investigation with the possibility of revoking the doctors license to practice.","p025","p050",2.3333,1.3333,2,3
588,281,24,13,"Person 2","Definitely. It will be the best move.","p025","p050",2,0,1.6667,2.6667
589,281,24,14,"Person 1","Yeah people deserve to be protected from this happening again.","p025","p050",2.6667,0,2.6667,2.6667
590,281,24,15,"Person 2","Exactly. She left all her wealth behind.","p025","p050",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
591,281,24,16,"Person 1","It is just really sad.","p025","p050",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
592,281,24,17,"Person 2","But what can make rich people fall depressed?","p025","p050",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
593,281,24,18,"Person 1","I dunno. Maybe she was extremely hard on herself.","p025","p050",1.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2
594,281,24,19,"Person 2","Yea, she got disconnected from everything...","p025","p050",2,1,2.6667,1.6667
595,281,24,20,"Person 1","The way she ended it is also pretty crazy.","p025","p050",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
596,281,24,21,"Person 2","Its scary..drowning! Jeezzz","p025","p050",4,2,3.3333,2.6667
597,281,24,22,"Person 1","Yeah just walking into the ocean.","p025","p050",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
598,281,24,23,"Person 2","I always see suicide as a selfish act though","p025","p050",3,2,1,2.6667
599,281,24,24,"Person 1","Yeah it is wierd for me to think about because I do not know what is going through their minds before they do it. I have never even thought about doing it so it is hard to understand.","p025","p050",2.3333,1.3333,2,3.3333
600,281,24,25,"Person 2","I cant. I will always consider my family and friends","p025","p050",3.3333,0.6667,2,3.3333
601,281,24,26,"Person 1","Yeah you have to think about how much damage you will do.","p025","p050",3.3333,0.6667,2,2.6667
602,281,24,27,"Person 2","I always do that","p025","p050",2.6667,0.3333,2,2
603,281,24,28,"Person 1","Well I think we have done enough turns. Was a good little conversation.","p025","p050",2,0,0.6667,1.3333
604,281,24,29,"Person 2","yea..bye","p025","p050",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
605,281,24,30,"Person 1","goodbye","p025","p050",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
606,281,25,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article?","p022","p010",0.6667,0.6667,1,1
607,281,25,1,"Person 2","It made me very sad.   She had such a hard life.   Whether it's socialized medicine or medicine here in the states, they miss so much with mental illness.","p022","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
608,281,25,2,"Person 1","I agree. I feel like we are not doing enough about mental illness as a society","p022","p010",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
609,281,25,3,"Person 2","We aren't.   I am so tired of physicians sending you to a therapist to talk about your childhood or given medicine that doesn't work.   No one listens to the patient at all.","p022","p010",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
610,281,25,4,"Person 1","Exactly! It's very rare you find a good therapist. Most of them just can't wait to get home.","p022","p010",3.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
611,281,25,5,"Person 2","Yes!   I have suffered from dark depression my entire life.   It has nothing to do with your childhood.   You were wired that way at birth.   To date, physicians are just initially tapping how to help people.    Such a long way to go.","p022","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,3
612,281,25,6,"Person 1","It must have been really tough for you. I think i have mild depression and it's such a struggle.","p022","p010",2.6667,2,2.3333,3.3333
613,281,25,7,"Person 2","Oh it is.   Your family doesn't know how to help.   I just stay exhausted and really never socialize.   It really has nothing for therapists to address.   They can help victims of assault, etc. but they do not help for depression.   At least, that's been the case for me.    I'm sorry you suffer from it.","p022","p010",2.6667,2,2.3333,3.6667
614,281,25,8,"Person 1","Yeah it's terrible. I have anxiety as well and everyday is a struggle to be honest","p022","p010",2.3333,2,2,3.6667
615,281,25,9,"Person 2","Just know I totally understand.   From personal experience, I think anxiety and depression go hand and hand.   I have a lot of anxiety around people or social settings.   What about you?","p022","p010",3.3333,1,3,2.6667
616,281,25,10,"Person 1","I am the same. I even have trouble going out with close friends sometimes. Just being around people, i don't like..","p022","p010",3,1.6667,2,3.3333
617,281,25,11,"Person 2","Yeah me too.   I looked at this article and remember this being in the news.   She did all the \"right\" things, physicians didn't share nor did they do anything with the statement of suicide.   That's unacceptable.","p022","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,3
618,281,25,12,"Person 1","Yeah i still feel bad for the person in the article. Do you think people in society now are more accepting of mental illnesses?","p022","p010",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
619,281,25,13,"Person 2","No - they just look at you with that pitiful look and once employers know they look for ways to terminate you - if you had cancer everyone is supportive.","p022","p010",3.6667,2,2.3333,3
620,281,25,14,"Person 1","That's an interesting way to look at it but i agree. I honestly don't think society will EVER be accepting of people with mental illnesses. They'll always think of us as the \"crazy\" ones.","p022","p010",4,2,2.3333,3.6667
621,281,25,15,"Person 2","And your point is exactly why none of us want to convey we have it.   To your point, we are all crazy.","p022","p010",3.3333,2,2,3
622,281,25,16,"Person 1","Well at least we all know deep down we're great people and just slightly different which makes us special.","p022","p010",3,0,1.6667,2.6667
623,281,25,17,"Person 2","We are - the thing we have to come to agreement on is how do we not feel like we can't do anything all the time.   I don't ever get a break from those feelings.","p022","p010",3,0.6667,1.6667,3
624,281,25,18,"Person 1","I get those feelings as well but i think we should tell ourselves that it's okay to have these feelings from time to time. But anyway, that's it for our convo, hope you have a great life and things improve! bye","p022","p010",3,0.3333,2,2.3333
625,281,25,19,"Person 2","It was nice chatting with you.    goodbye","p022","p010",1.6667,0.3333,1,1
626,171,26,0,"Person 1","Hey there! So this article is something. I can't help but wonder why people of different religious backgrounds can't seem to get along in that part of the world. We seem to do ok over here in the West.","p007","p030",2,1,3,3
627,171,26,1,"Person 2","Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed.","p007","p030",2,1,2,3
628,171,26,2,"Person 1","Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening.","p007","p030",3,2,2,4
629,171,26,3,"Person 2","I agree and am on the same page when it comes to religiosity. It seems like these militant groups in the Middle East are sincerely devoted to unmaking thousands of years of human progress.","p007","p030",1,2,3,4
630,171,26,4,"Person 1","Yea. I don't understand it personally. I guess their religion demands them to kill? Or maybe people in power have just twisted it into that meaning. It's just a shame though that people are being persecuted for their beliefs. What does it matter if someone else worships a different being than you? How does that effect you?","p007","p030",2,2,2,4
631,171,26,5,"Person 2","From what I understand about these groups is that they have decided to pervert their sacred texts in their interpretation so that they are in fact called to violence. An analog would be the Westboro Baptist church here in the states. If someone is not following the same religious tenets as you it makes them much more difficult to control; you aren't playing by the same rules.","p007","p030",2,2,4,3
632,171,26,6,"Person 1","Of course it comes down to control. I hate that people ar elike that to eachother tho. But of course I suppose it is in our nature to try to be dominant over eachother. Also as for Westboro, those people disgust me. Absolute degenerates full of hatred.","p007","p030",2,2,3,4
633,171,26,7,"Person 2","Hatred can be a very powerful force. Unfortunately, it seems that our world is filled with more of it every day; or at least those who are full of hatred have the loudest voices. I'd like to think that these militants truly believe that they are saving peoples souls, but the fact that they would allow them to stay as long as they paid a tax kind of robs the whole process of any mystique. This whole thing is about power. I agree about any self righteous group too. Can't you find something that is actually productive to do with your time?","p007","p030",2,2,2,4
634,171,26,8,"Person 1","I just hate that so many people need to suffer. It isn't right, no matter the reason, to persecute and murder people. And using religious views as a cover isn't an excuse. It also doesn't help that entire part of the world is so volitile in general. Hasn't there been conflict there for literal centuries?","p007","p030",2,2,3,3
635,171,26,9,"Person 2","Exactly, and that conflict prevents them from making any marked social or political progress at the lower levels of society. The rich get richer and the poor are left to fight each other over the scraps that remain. Plus, in a lot of ways America specifically has been spurning on this conflict for it's own vested interest in arms sales.","p007","p030",2,2,3,3
636,171,26,10,"Person 1","Don't forget the oil as well. We gotta chug that sweet sweet crude at the expense of our own soldiers lives, and the natives lives. It's a vicious cycle of greed, and power","p007","p030",2,2,2,2
637,171,26,11,"Person 2","Right, it's a crying shame. I have a very difficult time attempting to put myself in the shoes of the people who are affected by these types of problems. I mean, waking up in the middle of the night to your family being slaughtered or sold into slavery and being told to just deal with it?","p007","p030",3,2,2,3
638,171,26,12,"Person 1","And the trauma of war in general as well. Always living in fear of weather or not you are going to get bombed, shot, raped, etc. I'm sure that there is an immense amount of suffering in that region.","p007","p030",3,2,2,3
639,171,26,13,"Person 2","It's insane. The question is, what can we in the west even do to help? Is there anything at all?","p007","p030",3,1,4,2
640,171,26,14,"Person 1","Well the only thing we can do is use military, but that in and of itself is a bad thing because then they hate us even more.","p007","p030",3,2,3,2
641,171,26,15,"Person 2","I think that it would depend on the approach. I've heard there has been some success in the US forces training a standing army in Afghanistan, but not much. I was thinking more about humanitarian efforts.","p007","p030",2,1,3,2
642,171,26,16,"Person 1","Hmm. Not sure what we could do in that regard. I don't think they'll listen to the UN. Ugh it's just a complicated situation.","p007","p030",1,2,2,2
643,171,26,17,"Person 2","Yes, and after having this conversation definitely something I need to get more information on. I don't know about you but i've only about ten minutes left on my HIT timer, so why don't we wrap this up relatively quickly?","p007","p030",2,2,3,3
644,171,26,18,"Person 1","Same here.","p007","p030",1,1,1,1
645,171,26,19,"Person 2","So, do you hail from the states?","p007","p030",1,0,1,1
646,171,26,20,"Person 1","Indeed I do. Right in the bible belt.","p007","p030",1,0,1,4
647,171,26,21,"Person 2","Ha! Me too.","p007","p030",1,0,1,3
648,171,26,22,"Person 1","Yea. Thats why when you mentioned Westboro I immediately was like. Ew.","p007","p030",2,2,1,3
649,171,26,23,"Person 2","I've just seen them mentioned in mainstream media on occasion. Do you usually keep up with new?","p007","p030",1,1,1,3
650,171,26,24,"Person 1","Yea most of the time. People around here hate that group. They picketed at a marines funeral here once.","p007","p030",2,2,2,3
651,171,26,25,"Person 2","I actually heard about that. Totally shameful. Do you have family in the military?","p007","p030",3,2,2,3
652,171,26,26,"Person 1","Yes I do.","p007","p030",1,1,1,2
653,171,26,27,"Person 2","My younger brother is currently serving in the army.","p007","p030",1,0,2,3
654,171,26,28,"Person 1","My Uncle is in the Marines haha. Anyway, It's been a lovely conversation with you random turker. Have a great rest of the work day c:","p007","p030",2,0,2,3
655,171,26,29,"Person 2","Back at you!","p007","p030",0,0,1,3
656,171,26,30,"Person 1","bye","p007","p030",0,1,1,1
657,171,26,31,"Person 2","bye","p007","p030",0,1,1,1
658,171,27,0,"Person 1","This article just makes it so clear how little tolerance there really is in the world. It's sad we claim we are all so much more civilized these days, but the truth is we still seem people are more different than the same.","p055","p005",3,2,3,2.6667
659,171,27,1,"Person 2","It is really sad","p055","p005",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
660,171,27,2,"Person 1","I find it interesting that so many people still use religion as an excuse for violence and only focus on the most violent parts of the religion and ignore the preachings of tolerance and peace.","p055","p005",2.6667,1.3333,2,3.3333
661,171,27,3,"Person 2","I was gutted for those that were killed, and nothing was done as well","p055","p005",4.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
662,171,27,4,"Person 1","It is sad that there doesn't seem to be any way to help those people from the article. Even if they wanted to go back so much has been destoryed that you can understand why they'd want to stay away.","p055","p005",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
663,171,27,5,"Person 2","Thinking about this, I can only think what can really be done to curb this act","p055","p005",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
664,171,27,6,"Person 1","Until there is a change in the way extremists think and act, I can't see a way this will change.","p055","p005",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
665,171,27,7,"Person 2","you are absolutely right","p055","p005",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
666,171,27,8,"Person 1","I often wonder how a religion that millions can follow peacefully is allowed to be twisted by those same followers and used to do so much evil. Don't you think the islamic followers should do more to police the extremists?","p055","p005",3,1.6667,2,3
667,171,27,9,"Person 2","I think the Islamic leaders should speak out more against this act","p055","p005",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
668,171,27,10,"Person 1","I think so too. If religion is such an important aspect of their lives, why don't the leaders have more power to control the out of control elements of their religion?","p055","p005",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
669,171,27,11,"Person 2","I wonder as too as well","p055","p005",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
670,171,27,12,"Person 1","I just don't understand a religion that allows for the harm of those that aren't looking to harm you.","p055","p005",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
671,171,27,13,"Person 2","I think we should even put religion aside, it is never right to kill another person","p055","p005",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
672,171,27,14,"Person 1","I agree that killing is wrong. However, regarding this article it is nearly impossible to set religion aside as it is the reason the killings are happening.","p055","p005",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
673,171,27,15,"Person 2","oh yes you are right. I just wish Christians and Muslims can coexist peacefully","p055","p005",3,0.3333,1.6667,2
674,171,27,16,"Person 1","I don't understand why they can't. If both sides have elements of tolerance built right into the religion who is to say it's right to set aside those elements?","p055","p005",3,1.6667,1.3333,2
675,171,27,17,"Person 2","I think both religion should do all they can to promote peace","p055","p005",2,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
676,171,27,18,"Person 1","I wish they would. I mean taking the article into consideration again, even if you forget the killing the damage done in the name of religion needs to be addressed. Both sides need to do more to remember peace, tolerance and acceptance is better than violence and hatred.","p055","p005",3.6667,1,2,2.6667
677,171,27,19,"Person 2","We can only continue to hope things get better while moving forward","p055","p005",2.6667,0.3333,2,2
678,171,27,20,"Person 1","I do have hope. I mean on a person to person basis the idea of tolerance and peace seems so simple and easy. It just seems that when we take it to a global stage we start forgetting the meaning of those words.","p055","p005",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
679,171,27,21,"Person 2","me too, i will continue to do all i can as well to support peace","p055","p005",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
680,171,27,22,"Person 1","I too always try to promote acceptance and understanding. Perhaps if we all keep trying things will start to improve.","p055","p005",2,0.3333,1.6667,2
681,171,27,23,"Person 2","you are right mate","p055","p005",2,0.6667,1.3333,1
682,171,27,24,"Person 1","In the long run I guess we are left with the same thing as always -- hope for the future.","p055","p005",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
683,171,27,25,"Person 2","our new generation must be proud of the choice we made today as regards religion","p055","p005",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
684,171,27,26,"Person 1","I would like to think they would be. Religion is so tough to judge as people tend to interpret it for their own uses.","p055","p005",2,0.6667,2,2
685,171,27,27,"Person 2","And so sad considering that some people has been brainwashed and not so much we can do to change that","p055","p005",3.3333,2,2,2.3333
686,171,27,28,"Person 1","This is very true. The twisting of religion to use others to bring about your own desires is very sad. I think we've had a good discussion here. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, goodbye.","p055","p005",3,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
687,171,27,29,"Person 2","I think so too, it was a great discussion. bye","p055","p005",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
688,171,28,0,"Person 1","I felt very disturbed while reading the article about the family situations.","p021","p043",3.3333,2,3.6667,3
689,171,28,1,"Person 2","Yeah for sure...Do you think you personally would return to Mosul if you were a Christian?","p021","p043",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
690,171,28,2,"Person 1","It's a hard question.  I feel obligated to return, but it's so dangerous.","p021","p043",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
691,171,28,3,"Person 2","I agree, there would be a longing to fix the area and to prevent a similar disaster from happening again.","p021","p043",2,1.3333,3,2
692,171,28,4,"Person 1","Right, the whole town needs built again and the entire city is hurting from all the struggling. It would also be so hard to do alone. Would need a team that could agree.","p021","p043",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2
693,171,28,5,"Person 2","I don't even think they have the powers or the numbers to fix anything. They were a minority before all the bloodshed and they are losing members every day.","p021","p043",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
694,171,28,6,"Person 1","Yeah, that's why no one could do it alone. I'd hope there would be a few strong willed individuals that may be able to start something and train others","p021","p043",2,1.6667,3,2
695,171,28,7,"Person 2","It's a little like solving racism. What are the Christians really supposed to do? Tell the fanatical Muslims to not kill them because of their religion?","p021","p043",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
696,171,28,8,"Person 1","Which will never work. They'll do what they want and have been doing. Basically an army needs created, but they don't have the tools for that.","p021","p043",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
697,171,28,9,"Person 2","An army for what? Like an Israel vs the middle east situation? Where they basically stockpile weapons and a serious war could break out at any time.","p021","p043",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
698,171,28,10,"Person 1","Not that drastic hopefully. Something more of a union maybe, versus army. The few that can defend land or people from Muslims. But I agree, not a major force.","p021","p043",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
699,171,28,11,"Person 2","I think the internet is the only way to solve it. Once people talk to the other side and see they are just people like everyone else.","p021","p043",2.6667,1,1.6667,2
700,171,28,12,"Person 1","I'm not sure. The internet and possibly media may not work beneficially.","p021","p043",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
701,171,28,13,"Person 2","The way I see it, is growing up their family and friends are constantly pounding into their heads, \"hate the west.\" Then they go on a computer and play video games with American or European people and see that they aren't so bad. There's no reason to hate these people.","p021","p043",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
702,171,28,14,"Person 1","I can see that. But how is that going to get fixed. It's the elders opinion that would need to change.","p021","p043",2,1.6667,3,2
703,171,28,15,"Person 2","Yeah, once people are set in their ways, there's no changing their prejudices. You basically have to wait for the older people to die off...","p021","p043",2,2,2,2
704,171,28,16,"Person 1","It's a shame. They are hurting their own people instead of being able to move forward away from this crisis.","p021","p043",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
705,171,28,17,"Person 2","Also I think it's only a small fraction of the fanatical Muslims that are to blame.","p021","p043",2,1,1.6667,2
706,171,28,18,"Person 1","Granted, that may be true. But that small fraction on both sides is hindering the whole situation.","p021","p043",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
707,171,28,19,"Person 2","Yup. Anyway, it was really nice of France to welcome Christians that feared going back to Mosul.","p021","p043",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
708,171,28,20,"Person 1","Oh of course. Maybe France could send some ally's back with them to help regrow.","p021","p043",2.3333,0.3333,2,1.3333
709,171,28,21,"Person 2","I doubt that any French people would volunteer for that...","p021","p043",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
710,171,28,22,"Person 1","There's not exactly much hope there. But if some of the Christians have been able to become close to the French, it may be a start.","p021","p043",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
711,171,28,23,"Person 2","Yeah. Do you think America took in a lot of asylum seekers from this tragedy?","p021","p043",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
712,171,28,24,"Person 1","No, sadly America's own political stragedy prohibits too much outside assistance for that.","p021","p043",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
713,171,28,25,"Person 2","I think they have a lottery for Christians from Middle Eastern countries.","p021","p043",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
714,171,28,26,"Person 1","Some are allowed to come, but not nearly the amount that actually need help and assistance.","p021","p043",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
715,171,28,27,"Person 2","Yeah but the amount of people that need help and assistance is far more people than we can handle. That's millions of people!","p021","p043",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
716,171,28,28,"Person 1","Agreed completely! America can't do that. I'm not on board with the complete denial. I think petitions are needed to keep the process flowing.","p021","p043",3.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
717,171,28,29,"Person 2","Yeah, that makes sense. I hope in the next couple of generations the tension in the Middle East will finally be released.","p021","p043",2,1.3333,3,2
718,171,28,30,"Person 1","goodbye","p021","p043",0.6667,1,1,1
719,171,28,31,"Person 2","bye","p021","p043",0.6667,1,1,1
720,171,29,0,"Person 1","I never thought about the painful memories keeping people from returning.","p035","p019",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
721,171,29,1,"Person 2","Do you mean to like their homeland?","p035","p019",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
722,171,29,2,"Person 1","Yes, after wars and what they have seen.","p035","p019",2,1.6667,3,1.3333
723,171,29,3,"Person 2","Yah.. I never really thought about it either but it makes total sense","p035","p019",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
724,171,29,4,"Person 1","How long before the middle east is put back together, I don't think it will be in our lifetime.","p035","p019",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
725,171,29,5,"Person 2","I agree... which is sad to think about. How long will those peopel continue to suffer? and the people trying to help suffering as well","p035","p019",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
726,171,29,6,"Person 1","Yeah it is very sad","p035","p019",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
727,171,29,7,"Person 2","and it could be fixed! There is the funds out there in the world, and the know how.","p035","p019",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
728,171,29,8,"Person 1","I agree with that","p035","p019",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
729,171,29,9,"Person 2","These stories just make me think/realize the massive gap that there is in the world","p035","p019",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
730,171,29,10,"Person 1","These stories are very sad and make me thankful for my life.","p035","p019",3,1.3333,4,3
731,171,29,11,"Person 2","For sure, it reminds me to take a step back and just be grateful for what I have","p035","p019",3,0.3333,2.3333,3.3333
732,171,29,12,"Person 1","Totally","p035","p019",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
733,171,29,13,"Person 2","and the people who go to help, I'm sure they will struggle with what they saw/did etc for the rest of their life...","p035","p019",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
734,171,29,14,"Person 1","I would be. To be told to convert or die is the ultimate test of faith.","p035","p019",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
735,171,29,15,"Person 2","Yes and they shouldn't have to make that kkind of choice over faith.. it's silly","p035","p019",3,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
736,171,29,16,"Person 1","Very silly to us, but some people do take their faith as life or death.","p035","p019",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
737,171,29,17,"Person 2","Yes, which is their choice I guess","p035","p019",2,1,2,2
738,171,29,18,"Person 1","I believe, but I don't fault others for believing different from me.","p035","p019",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,3
739,171,29,19,"Person 2","I don't either, everyone is entitled to their own opinion","p035","p019",2,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
740,171,29,20,"Person 1","It was very nice chatting with you! bye","p035","p019",1.6667,0,1,1
741,171,29,21,"Person 2","bye","p035","p019",1,1,1,1
742,171,30,0,"Person 1","I felt sad for these people being persecuted for their beliefs.","p029","p030",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
743,171,30,1,"Person 2","yeah, having every place with any a shred of personal significance leveled and re-purposed must be an awful feeling.","p029","p030",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
744,171,30,2,"Person 1","yeah seriously.  It made me very grateful to be an American.","p029","p030",3,0.6667,2.3333,3
745,171,30,3,"Person 2","I'm not sure how I feel about our government being directly involved, but it is nice to not have to worry about being hit with a missile in the middle of the night.","p029","p030",2,1.3333,3,2.3333
746,171,30,4,"Person 1","yes no doubt, and to be free to believe what we want to believe","p029","p030",2,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
747,171,30,5,"Person 2","It's kind of inspiring how so many people with different religious backgrounds seemed to be living in relative peace before the Islamic State showed up.","p029","p030",2,0,2.6667,2.6667
748,171,30,6,"Person 1","yeah seriously.  They seem to bring conflict wherever they go","p029","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
749,171,30,7,"Person 2","They seem to think they are on some kind of holy crusade.","p029","p030",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
750,171,30,8,"Person 1","yes it almost seems delusional","p029","p030",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
751,171,30,9,"Person 2","definitely anachronistic. It seems like they're from some different timeline.","p029","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
752,171,30,10,"Person 1","yeah seriously, barbaric almost or just archaic.","p029","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
753,171,30,11,"Person 2","How do you feel about them rounding up people to use as human shields?","p029","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
754,171,30,12,"Person 1","that's absolutely despicable.  what do you think","p029","p030",4.3333,2,3,2.3333
755,171,30,13,"Person 2","I'm just wondering how exactly they are using them and couldn't that human resource be applied more practically? It just seems like such a waste.","p029","p030",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
756,171,30,14,"Person 1","it is highly unethical, I can't think of a situation where that would ever be ok","p029","p030",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
757,171,30,15,"Person 2","oh, i'm not condoning the activity. I'm just wondering why? just, why?","p029","p030",3,1.3333,1.6667,2
758,171,30,16,"Person 1","Yeah, like what would possess someone to even do that?","p029","p030",3.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
759,171,30,17,"Person 2","hate, most likely hate.","p029","p030",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
760,171,30,18,"Person 1","yes, and pure evil","p029","p030",3,2,2.3333,2

768,386,31,5,"Person 2","Have you ever had a panic attack? That's one of the things they go through according to the article.","p056","p013",2.3333,1,3.6667,2.6667
769,386,31,6,"Person 1","No I stay pretty calml","p056","p013",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
770,386,31,7,"Person 2","what do you think can be done to prevent PTSD","p056","p013",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
771,386,31,8,"Person 1","I think we need to spend more for veterans mental health","p056","p013",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
772,386,31,9,"Person 2","i agree with that","p056","p013",2.3333,2,2,2

778,386,31,15,"Person 2","because they did something small like J walking or anything considered illegal. Even a","p056","p013",4,2,2.6667,3.6667

782,386,31,19,"Person 2","should happen in the future","p056","p013",2.6667,2,3,3
783,386,31,20,"Person 1","yes skynet will become self aware","p056","p013",2.6667,2,4.3333,2

786,386,31,23,"Person 2","bye","p056","p013",3,1.3333,3,1.6667
787,386,32,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p055","p005",4.3333,0.6667,3.6667,3.3333
788,386,32,1,"Person 2","I think a lot of people are experiencing PTSD from combat.","p055","p005",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
789,386,32,2,"Person 1","I agree... and it's sad they don't have the support from their country like they should","p055","p005",4.3333,2,3.3333,3.3333
790,386,32,3,"Person 2","I don't know much about the VA and the support it provides or doesn't.","p055","p005",2.3333,0.6667,3,2.3333
791,386,32,4,"Person 1","I used to work in the VA doing medical data entry... it's always so backed up and people just do the bare minimum to try and keep up with the demand","p055","p005",4,0.6667,3.3333,2.6667
792,386,32,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I can see that happening.  I wonder why this is so prevalent now when it doesn't seem to have been as much of an issue in earlier wars, like WW2","p055","p005",2.3333,0,3,3.3333
793,386,32,6,"Person 1","My bet is people had the same symptoms but were less vocal about them as times have changed.","p055","p005",3.3333,0,3.3333,2.3333
794,386,32,7,"Person 2","Could be.  But I think it might be more than that.  We seem less capable of handling stress and anxiety.  I agree that part of it is just more talk about it and being more open, and diagnosing stuff more.  But I think we're less resilient as people for some reason too.","p055","p005",2.3333,0,2.6667,2.6667
795,386,32,8,"Person 1","I think that could play into it too, paretns coddle their kids more and such creating less \"strong\" adults","p055","p005",3,0,2.6667,2.3333
796,386,32,9,"Person 2","Yes, we definitely live \"soft\" lives in many ways.  At some point I guess our wars will be fought by robots, so maybe this won't be an issue in 50 years.","p055","p005",2.3333,0,2.6667,2.3333
797,386,32,10,"Person 1","Or I just hope wars will lessen and lessen over 50 years and there is nothing/nobody fighting but that is high hope","p055","p005",3,0,3,2.3333
798,386,32,11,"Person 2","Yes, a high hope, but there at least seems to be a move towards smaller conflicts.","p055","p005",2.3333,0,2.6667,2
799,386,32,12,"Person 1","Yes I think so... Unless something big happens","p055","p005",3.3333,0,2.3333,2
800,386,32,13,"Person 2","I think the relative strength and destructiveness of major powers does inhibit large-scale conflict.  Too much destruction to risk going to war, so we fought proxy battles and use diplomacy and sanctions and things like that more than hot wars.  But of course one leader could change that.","p055","p005",2.6667,0,2.6667,2
801,386,32,14,"Person 1","That is true, we are leaning more towards that method of \"war\" or preventing it. But yes, I mean look at WWII all it takes is one person more or less","p055","p005",3.3333,0,3.3333,2
802,386,32,15,"Person 2","And if hostile aliens show up then all bets are off.","p055","p005",3,0,2.3333,2.3333
803,386,32,16,"Person 1","haha I hope that doens't happy","p055","p005",3.3333,0,3,2
804,386,32,17,"Person 2","It would probably bring the planet together, but could also spell our doom, or enslavement, or something.  I only bring it up jokingly because of that UFO story recently.","p055","p005",2,0,2.6667,2
805,386,32,18,"Person 1","Haha I figured... But i mean who reallly knows!","p055","p005",2.3333,0,3.3333,2
806,386,32,19,"Person 2","Yeah, it's a big universe.  We probably don't know as much about it as we'd like to think.","p055","p005",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
807,386,32,20,"Person 1","For sure... it's been nice chatting. Bye","p055","p005",3,0,3.6667,3.3333

811,386,33,1,"Person 2","Yeah, it's so bad that they had to suffer in the war and now they have to suffer even out of war.","p039","p024",1,1,1,1.3333
812,386,33,2,"Person 1","Yeah we should do more to support them.","p039","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
813,386,33,3,"Person 2","I wish there was a way we can donate directly to them.","p039","p024",3.3333,2,3,2
814,386,33,4,"Person 1","That would be nice","p039","p024",2.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
815,386,33,5,"Person 2","I feel bad for their families as well because they're probably impacted.","p039","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
816,386,33,6,"Person 1","My father was in the Navy and I have two sisters in the Army","p039","p024",2,0.3333,1,2.6667
817,386,33,7,"Person 2","Wow, that's awesome. Much respect to them. How did it impact your family, if it did at all?","p039","p024",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
818,386,33,8,"Person 1","None of them had to do direct battle, but my sisters I see a lot less. One is in Germany and the other is in Japan.","p039","p024",2.3333,0.6667,3,2.6667
819,386,33,9,"Person 2","Oh okay, Japan sounds cool. I really hope veterans get the help they need in the future.","p039","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
820,386,33,10,"Person 1","Me too, they earned it.","p039","p024",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
821,386,33,11,"Person 2","Do you think you would ever be able to go to war","p039","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
822,386,33,12,"Person 1","No and you?","p039","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
823,386,33,13,"Person 2","Definitely not. I am a chicken when it comes to that which is why i respect veterans and people serving the nation so much","p039","p024",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
824,386,33,14,"Person 1","Me too","p039","p024",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
825,386,33,15,"Person 2","Hopefully the veterans that make it out are able to find great jobs and live a decent life at least.","p039","p024",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
826,386,33,16,"Person 1","Yeah and get health care","p039","p024",3.6667,2,2.3333,2
827,386,33,17,"Person 2","Health care would be a great start!","p039","p024",2.3333,0,3,2
828,386,33,18,"Person 1","and a place to live, they only put their life on the line for us!","p039","p024",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
829,386,33,19,"Person 2","Agreed! Well it was nice talking to you, bye","p039","p024",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
830,386,33,20,"Person 1","you too! bye","p039","p024",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
831,386,34,0,"Person 1","Hi; I thought the article was pretty accurate.","p019","p062",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
832,386,34,1,"Person 2","I can relate to them in some ways I think","p019","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
833,386,34,2,"Person 1","I can't even imagine what it would be like to be at war, or in the services in general.","p019","p062",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
834,386,34,3,"Person 2","mental illness is horrible and they deserve help","p019","p062",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
835,386,34,4,"Person 1","I agree. We should take better care of our servicemen and women.","p019","p062",2.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
836,386,34,5,"Person 2","They have done so much for us we owe it to them","p019","p062",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
837,386,34,6,"Person 1","We should also not enter needless wars and send them away unnecessarily. It's too common.","p019","p062",1.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
838,386,34,7,"Person 2","Its all about money, it creates money so it will continue to happen","p019","p062",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
839,386,34,8,"Person 1","They're just pawns in a big political game.","p019","p062",2.3333,2,1.6667,3
840,386,34,9,"Person 2","It all needs to stop but we both know it will not","p019","p062",2,2,1.6667,2.6667
841,386,34,10,"Person 1","Agreed. I don't believe they're really \"defending our freedom\" and I wish young kids would stop joining for the recognition.","p019","p062",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
842,386,34,11,"Person 2","Do you believe that's what it is? I think these young kids are tricked into joining","p019","p062",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
843,386,34,12,"Person 1","That, too. And bribed- crazy amounts of money, travel, free education...","p019","p062",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
844,386,34,13,"Person 2","They have no idea what they are fighting for, they are dying for a country that does not care about them","p019","p062",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
845,386,34,14,"Person 1","100%. I can't imagine just following someone else's orders blindly.","p019","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
846,386,34,15,"Person 2","I was sent to prison for 5 years for a crime that never even occured so I know this country is a joke","p019","p062",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
847,386,34,16,"Person 1","That's terrible. You definitely got a firsthand view. My secondhand view isn't very favorable, either.","p019","p062",2.6667,1,1,1.6667
848,386,34,17,"Person 2","It was horrible being locked in a cage like an animal for something that never even happened","p019","p062",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
849,386,34,18,"Person 1","I imagine. That would be traumatizing.","p019","p062",2.6667,0.6667,1,1.6667
850,386,34,19,"Person 2","I can somewhat understand what soldiers go through being away from their families for so long","p019","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
851,386,34,20,"Person 1","It would be really hard coming back and adjusting. And hard for the families, too, obviously.","p019","p062",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
852,386,34,21,"Person 2","What I think is really sad is so many of them are homeless, I think it needs to be stopped, there is a man in my city that goes around and interviews the homeless and at least 70% are veterans...it makes no sense to me that they are homeless after fighting for out country but these nasty girls only have to have a baby thats a different color than them to get $12 a month appartments","p019","p062",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1
853,386,34,22,"Person 1","I can't believe so many are homeless after making so much money while serving. Where does it go?","p019","p062",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
866,386,35,0,"Person 1","This is a subject that is near and dear to my heart as my brother served for 12 years and has suffered with PTSD because of it. I think it is our job, as those citizens that receive the freedoms they fight for, that we should do more to make sure we take care of our veterns.","p035","p022",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
867,386,35,1,"Person 2","yes such disrespect should be frown at","p035","p022",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
868,386,35,2,"Person 1","I think it should be more than frowned at. We need to focus more on helping our veterans than just about anything else as a society. They are doing what we can't or won't and don't deserve to be forgotten.","p035","p022",2.6667,0.3333,3,2
869,386,35,3,"Person 2","Yes these people absolutely give their all to the country","p035","p022",2.3333,0.3333,3,2.3333
870,386,35,4,"Person 1","Exactly and they deserve more from us. We need to make sure PTSD is taken seriously and we do more to help.","p035","p022",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
871,386,35,5,"Person 2","I think there should be a facility made to help these veteran battling with this","p035","p022",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
872,386,35,6,"Person 1","A facility might be a start, but I think that makes it seem like we want to put them away somewhere so we don't have to see them. I'd rather see more community activities where we interact with them and help them as individuals.","p035","p022",1,0.6667,1.6667,3.6667
873,386,35,7,"Person 2","I will definitely support that","p035","p022",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.3333
874,386,35,8,"Person 1","I hope that as more people talk about it more people will also seek help.","p035","p022",1.6667,1,1.3333,3
875,386,35,9,"Person 2","Well need collective effort of the citizen to make sure this is done","p035","p022",2.3333,0.3333,3.3333,2
876,386,35,10,"Person 1","I agree. The more people willing to help. The more our veterans will understand that we want to help them.","p035","p022",2,0.3333,2.6667,2
877,386,35,11,"Person 2","And more veteran battling with this will be able to come out and seek out help as well","p035","p022",0.6667,0.6667,1,1.3333
878,386,35,12,"Person 1","Exactly. We have to be more willing to talk about this situation so that more veterans will understand that we want to help and that there is help to be found.","p035","p022",0.6667,1,1,2
879,386,35,13,"Person 2","We really need to be warm to them honestly","p035","p022",2.3333,1,1.3333,3.6667
880,386,35,14,"Person 1","I agree. If we treat them as humans and not statistics and let them see we can understand their frustrations and issues I'd like to believe we will make a difference.","p035","p022",1,0.6667,1.3333,2
881,386,35,15,"Person 2","We need to lay good foundation for generations coming as regards this","p035","p022",2,0.3333,3,1.6667
882,386,35,16,"Person 1","For sure. We need to look at this as a long term commitment and not just a fad of the moment. Our veterans are going to need care for the rest of their lives and they deserve it.","p035","p022",1.3333,0.3333,3,1.6667
883,386,35,17,"Person 2","Doing this will increase the morale of people who are willing to serve the country more","p035","p022",2.3333,0.3333,3,1.3333
884,386,35,18,"Person 1","If we show that we are willing to understand them after their service. I think it will help those currently serving and those thinking about it.","p035","p022",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.6667
885,386,35,19,"Person 2","No doubt about that","p035","p022",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.3333
886,386,35,20,"Person 1","I think one of the most important things to remember and consider is we have to treat each veteran as his own person. The cure isn't a one size fits all and we need to dedicate the time and effort needed to make sure each one is treated personally.","p035","p022",1,0.3333,0.3333,1
896,58,36,0,"Person 1","I had never considered the zoo animals in countries like Venezuela. How sad.","p056","p032",3,1.6667,3,2.6667
897,58,36,1,"Person 2","Me, too. We think about the effects of poverty, war on humans ... but not animals.","p056","p032",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
898,58,36,2,"Person 1","I was kind of concerned when it started talking about zoo owners being fined or punished. It's not really *their* fault.","p056","p032",2.3333,0.6667,2,3
899,58,36,3,"Person 2","That's an excellent point. The owners can't change the situation, that isn't fair at all. It isn't as if they want their animals to be sick/die!","p056","p032",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
900,58,36,4,"Person 1","I thought that embalming/preserving some of the animals was a valid idea, for science, but only if absolutely necessary and only if they were euthanized humanely.","p056","p032",1.6667,0.6667,2,2.3333
901,58,36,5,"Person 2","Agreed - I would imagine that would provide a more humane death than starvation/malnutrition. Do you consider yourself to be an animal lover?","p056","p032",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
902,58,36,6,"Person 1","Definitely. Do you?","p056","p032",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
903,58,36,7,"Person 2","Absolutely. My grad degree is in Animal Behavior. :)  Do you have any pets?","p056","p032",2,0,1.3333,3
904,58,36,8,"Person 1","That's interesting! I do; a dog and a cat.","p056","p032",2,0,1,3
905,58,36,9,"Person 2","Nice! Do they get along?","p056","p032",1.3333,0,1,1.6667
906,58,36,10,"Person 1","Yes, thankfully, haha. And the Great Dane that I babysit gets along relatively well, also.","p056","p032",2,0,1,2
907,58,36,11,"Person 2","That is a lot of dog to babysit! Is your dog a large breed, too?","p056","p032",2.3333,0,1,2.6667
908,58,36,12,"Person 1","He's 50-60 lbs, so mid-range? He's a catahoula.","p056","p032",1.6667,0.6667,1,2.6667
909,58,36,13,"Person 2","I just googled Catahoulas - what gorgeous dogs! And I thought I knew my dog breeds. :)","p056","p032",2,0,1,2.3333
910,58,36,14,"Person 1","I get a lot of funny looks when i mention his breed, sometimes! He is very handsome.","p056","p032",2,0.3333,1,3
911,58,36,15,"Person 2","What's his temperament like?","p056","p032",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
912,58,36,16,"Person 1","Well, I adopted him at 3.5, so I can't testify what is breed standard and what was due to his previous owner/occupation. He was a military family's dog who \"worked\" on base, and he accompanied them to work. But he's wonderful. Very calm, emotionally sensitive. Great with kids. Not any of the agression or hyperactivity you hear about the breed.","p056","p032",2,0,1,3.3333
913,58,36,17,"Person 2","Sounds wonderful - and sounds like you lucked out! Did you adopt him through a special service?","p056","p032",2,0,1,1.3333
914,58,36,18,"Person 1","No, our local animal shelter, actually. The family was being relocated overseas and the base in the other location didn't allow dogs. They released him to the shelter so that his new home would be checked out and verified safe beforehand. We did luck out!","p056","p032",2,0,1,3
915,58,36,19,"Person 2","That's even better. I ask because I have friends who adopted a dog that was being trained as a mobility assistant - but he failed the final test after pulling someone out of a wheelchair to chase a rabbit. :)","p056","p032",1.6667,0,1,3
916,58,36,20,"Person 1","hahah! those rabbits are tricky!","p056","p032",2.3333,0,1,1.6667
917,58,36,21,"Person 2","Right? And irresistable!","p056","p032",2.6667,0,1,1.3333
918,58,36,22,"Person 1","I'm surprised the dog got to the final test, but I guess it's a good thing a rabbit came by","p056","p032",1.6667,0.3333,1,2.6667
919,58,36,23,"Person 2","LOL, seriously! That would have made for an unpleasant surprise for the new owner","p056","p032",2.6667,0,1,2
920,58,36,24,"Person 1","could have been dangerous! but I'm sure he's a lovely pet","p056","p032",2,1,1,2.3333
921,58,36,25,"Person 2","He was - they taught him to sort recycling (that's Seattle for you) and he was the ring bearer at their wedding","p056","p032",1.6667,0.3333,1,2.6667
922,58,36,26,"Person 1","precious!","p056","p032",2,0,1,1.6667
923,58,36,27,"Person 2","It was absurdly sweet","p056","p032",2.6667,0,1,2
924,58,36,28,"Person 1","Do you have pets yourself? And did your degree focus on specific species?","p056","p032",1,0.6667,1,1
925,58,36,29,"Person 2","I do - I'm not sure what happened, but I have cats ... 5 cats. It's a bit terrifying. And, yes, thanks for asking! I'm technically a \"primatologist\" - I ran around watching monkeys","p056","p032",2.6667,0.3333,1,3.6667
926,58,36,30,"Person 1","interesting! I almost went into equine studies. instead I got my AKC training certificate and an elementary education degree lol","p056","p032",2,0.3333,1,3.6667
927,58,36,31,"Person 2","Nice! I work with some folks doing applied animal behavior with dogs. Cool stuff. And I teach at community college, so I'm right there with you! :)","p056","p032",2,0,1,3.3333
928,58,36,32,"Person 1","I think we've hit our 15, but it was a fun chat with you!","p056","p032",2.3333,0,0.6667,1.6667
929,58,36,33,"Person 2","Right back at you! Have a lovely day!","p056","p032",2,0,0.3333,1
930,58,36,34,"Person 1","bye!","p056","p032",1,0,0.3333,1

964,58,38,0,"Person 1","I feel like there should be some kind of worldwide contingency plan for situations like this, so the animals won't starve to death in cages.","p030","p039",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
965,58,38,1,"Person 2","I know poor animals","p030","p039",3,1.3333,3,2.6667
966,58,38,2,"Person 1","I think i've read about different agencies doing extractions of animals from war torn countries in the middle east, but i'd be willing to be the Venezuelan government would rather have them starve than deal with a foreign presence in their country.","p030","p039",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
967,58,38,3,"Person 2","yes do you think we should stop the sanctions","p030","p039",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
968,58,38,4,"Person 1","against Venezuela?","p030","p039",1,1,1,1
969,58,38,5,"Person 2","yes","p030","p039",1,0.6667,1,1
970,58,38,6,"Person 1","I think that venezuela is being propped up mostly by Cuba/Russia, so we're kind of shooting the messenger in that regard.","p030","p039",1.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
971,58,38,7,"Person 2","yea they are but our sanctions are starving the people","p030","p039",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
972,58,38,8,"Person 1","I think that there is enough going on stateside right now that we should probably shy away from meddling in foreign affairs for the most part, so yes I think we should.","p030","p039",1.6667,2,1,2
973,58,38,9,"Person 2","I agree we need to take care of our own first","p030","p039",2.3333,0.6667,1,1.6667
974,58,38,10,"Person 1","Do you think the animals would fair better if they were simply turned loose?","p030","p039",1,1,1.3333,1.6667
975,58,38,11,"Person 2","they might it is a tropical climate","p030","p039",1,0,1.3333,1.6667
976,58,38,12,"Person 1","I guess it depends on the kinds of animals that are being housed there, but I think giving them a fair shake in the wild is more ethical than starving them to death.","p030","p039",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
977,58,38,13,"Person 2","the penguins would have it rough","p030","p039",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
978,58,38,14,"Person 1","I mean, it mentioned that some of the animals hadn't eaten in weeks. I'm sure if they're not feeding them they are also neglecting cleaning and medical care. The poor penguins are probably long gone.","p030","p039",3,1.3333,3,2.3333

981,58,38,17,"Person 2","can you imagine the lions","p030","p039",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
982,58,38,18,"Person 1","I don't want too, but I can. Well, thanks for chatting about this horrific situation with me. bye","p030","p039",3,1.6667,2.3333,2
983,58,38,19,"Person 2","bye","p030","p039",0.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
984,58,39,0,"Person 1","Wow. What did you think of the article?","p016","p029",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
985,58,39,1,"Person 2","I thought it was terrible!!  What did you think?","p016","p029",4.3333,2,2.3333,3
986,58,39,2,"Person 1","I found it super upsetting. :( Kinda feels like power + greed wrecks everything -- people, environments, animals. :(","p016","p029",4.3333,2,3,2.6667
987,58,39,3,"Person 2","Yes really!!!  I mean, slaughtering horses to feed people and animals?  That is a tragedy!!!!","p016","p029",4.3333,2,3,2.6667
988,58,39,4,"Person 1","Feeding lions pumpkins or whatever caught my eye the most. Like, they're carnivores, that won't keep them alive. What do you think should be done?","p016","p029",4,1.6667,2.6667,2
989,58,39,5,"Person 2","Yeah really!  That was crazy.  I really do not know.  Venezuela has deep, deep issues.  Not easy to fix.  Whaty do you think?","p016","p029",4,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
990,58,39,6,"Person 1","I don't know. Zoos are already kinda questionable ethically, but I for sure think you shouldn't have one if you can't take care of it. It seems like the animals should be moved elsewhere.","p016","p029",3.3333,1,2.3333,2
991,58,39,7,"Person 2","Yeah I had the exact same thought.  Although what to do with all the animals?  If they just released them suely they would die or be slaughtered","p016","p029",3.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
992,58,39,8,"Person 1","I assume they'd have to be moved somewhere else, maybe another country's zoo or wildlife center until they can be put somewhere permanently?","p016","p029",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
993,58,39,9,"Person 2","Yes I thought that too, but who would pay for the move, and who would coordinate it all?","p016","p029",2,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
994,58,39,10,"Person 1","It'd have to be another organization, I think the article mentioned a couple -- IFAW and Four Paws or something? But getting the governments to agree would be tricky.","p016","p029",2,0.3333,1.6667,2
995,58,39,11,"Person 2","yeah exactly.  That would be ideal though if an organization would sponsor that","p016","p029",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
996,58,39,12,"Person 1","Yeah. It's sad how it seems to be going on in a lot of countries. :(","p016","p029",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
997,58,39,13,"Person 2","yeah it really is very, very sad","p016","p029",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
998,58,39,14,"Person 1","And then if the animals are getting that bad of a hand, the actual people are, too. :(","p016","p029",3.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
999,58,39,15,"Person 2","yes!  all living creatures with feelings.","p016","p029",3.3333,0.3333,3,1.6667
1000,58,39,16,"Person 1","The fact that we still have famine/hunger issues when there's more than enough food to go around is a true failure of our time","p016","p029",3.3333,1,3,1.6667
1001,58,39,17,"Person 2","yeah and so much waste here in the USA","p016","p029",3,1,2,1.6667
1002,58,39,18,"Person 1","Yeah. Do you have any further thoughts?","p016","p029",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
1003,58,39,19,"Person 2","no, sorry, do you?","p016","p029",1,0.6667,1.3333,1
1004,58,39,20,"Person 1","i don't think so. bye!","p016","p029",1,1,0.3333,1
1005,58,39,21,"Person 2","bye!","p016","p029",0.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1006,58,40,0,"Person 1","how sad is this situation. poor animals","p020","p022",2.6667,2,3.6667,3
1007,58,40,1,"Person 2","It's very sad. These animals definitely do not deserve this.","p020","p022",3,2,3.3333,3
1008,58,40,2,"Person 1","right  that government is a mess someone needs to step in","p020","p022",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
1009,58,40,3,"Person 2","Yeah! I mean even zoos in the US, i feel bad for the animals.","p020","p022",2.3333,2,3,3.3333
1010,58,40,4,"Person 1","me too. I hate seeing them locked in cages doesnt seem right.","p020","p022",2,2,3.3333,2.6667
1011,58,40,5,"Person 2","It's just weird to think about. People take these animals away, put them in cages, just so they can make money.","p020","p022",2,1.6667,2,2.6667
1012,58,40,6,"Person 1","yea and they brainwash you into thinking theyre helping the animals","p020","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
1013,58,40,7,"Person 2","Exactly. How often do you see a lion exhibit with just 1 lion. What do you think it does all day? It's so sad.","p020","p022",3,2,3.3333,2.6667
1014,58,40,8,"Person 1","if you think about it some people do that to cats and dogs when theyre not allowed outside. I wonder if theyre saad too","p020","p022",2,1.6667,3,2.6667
1015,58,40,9,"Person 2","Definitely. I am actually guilty of that. I have 1 dog whom i never walked outside because we lived in a tiny apartment. Now she has issues as she gets older, terrible anxiety.","p020","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
1016,58,40,10,"Person 1","aww but i also feel like having a dog and giving them attention is way better than locking an animal in a cage and never interacting with it","p020","p022",3,1,2.6667,3.3333
1017,58,40,11,"Person 2","Yeah that is true. I think zoos are terrible but if we never had zoos, it'd be really hard to see most of these animals","p020","p022",2.3333,2,2,3
1018,58,40,12,"Person 1","true they are very cute and at least in the united states we know they arent starving","p020","p022",2,0.3333,1.6667,2
1019,58,40,13,"Person 2","I guess that's true. You feel bad for these animals too because they're taken away from their familes. ( or maybe they're just rescues)","p020","p022",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
1020,58,40,14,"Person 1","yea you never really hear where they get the animals from I hope they are all rescued","p020","p022",2,0.6667,2.3333,2
1021,58,40,15,"Person 2","Do you enjoy going to the zoo?","p020","p022",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
1022,58,40,16,"Person 1","I honestly never had it is always hot and smells kind of gross. How about you?","p020","p022",1.6667,1,1,2.6667
1023,58,40,17,"Person 2","It is very fun!  I would recommend going just to see all the animals up close","p020","p022",2.6667,0,1,2.6667
1024,58,40,18,"Person 1","it sounds like a fun experience I went a couple of times when I was young but do not remember it at all.","p020","p022",1.6667,0,1,2
1025,58,40,19,"Person 2","Interesting, definitely give it another go! Well it was nice talking to you, bye","p020","p022",2,0,0.6667,1.3333
1026,58,40,20,"Person 1","bye","p020","p022",1,0.6667,0.3333,1
1059,289,42,0,"Person 1","I thought it was very sad but also kind of uplifting","p072","p034",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
1060,289,42,1,"Person 2","Yes it was both.","p072","p034",2.3333,1,3.3333,1.6667
1061,289,42,2,"Person 1","It happens all the time which is crazy","p072","p034",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.3333
1062,289,42,3,"Person 2","It always hits me especially hard when it was a celeb I liked as a kid. I guess because as a kid you think the stars are invincible.","p072","p034",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
1063,289,42,4,"Person 1","Yeah, I can see that. It also just seems to diminish their health really fast","p072","p034",2,2,3.3333,1
1064,289,42,5,"Person 2","I was especially sad to hear how she feels bad when she looks at her husband, she feels guilty while he must just be so worried","p072","p034",3,2,3,3
1065,289,42,6,"Person 1","Whenever I see these stories, I always wonder is there is a cure to be found","p072","p034",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
1066,289,42,7,"Person 2","My sister in law just beat breast cancer but she had to go through chemo and radiation","p072","p034",2,1,3.3333,3.6667
1067,289,42,8,"Person 1","The whole ordeal must be very painful, Chemo has so many adverse affects.","p072","p034",3,2,2.6667,1.3333
1068,289,42,9,"Person 2","I went through it but not for cancer. I have an autoimmune disease and they tried chemo on it. I felt like I was dying for 7 months. It completely wiped me out. It sucks.","p072","p034",4,2,3,4
1069,289,42,10,"Person 1","That sounds rough. Not sure how people deal with it for years.","p072","p034",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
1070,289,42,11,"Person 2","Not at all! And for me it was experimental. To have that as the ONLY choice and know your odds aren't good anyway? I can't imagine. Some people have tiny survival rates, it's so sad.","p072","p034",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
1071,289,42,12,"Person 1","Yeah, I would not blame anyone who decides to take euthanasia","p072","p034",2.6667,2,3.6667,3.3333
1072,289,42,13,"Person 2","No, I hear people say all the time they won't put themselves through chemo and I don't blame them. But a lot of cancers are beatable, so people try to hold on to hope. It's hard.","p072","p034",3,2,3.3333,2
1073,289,42,14,"Person 1","I get that, but also some like pancreatic I hear have less than a 5% survival rate.","p072","p034",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
1074,289,42,15,"Person 2","That's terrifying","p072","p034",3.6667,2,4,3
1075,289,42,16,"Person 1","Extremely as one can only imagine","p072","p034",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667
1076,289,42,17,"Person 2","I could not handle seeing my spouse go through that. I think it's harder than being sick yourself.","p072","p034",3,2,3.6667,2.6667
1077,289,42,18,"Person 1","I would certainly breakdown if my spouse went through that","p072","p034",2.6667,2,3.6667,3.3333
1078,289,42,19,"Person 2","It's so emotionally draining when someone you love is sick becaue you just want them to be ok but it's so hard to keep yourself going","p072","p034",3.3333,2,3.3333,3.3333
1079,289,42,20,"Person 1","Yeah and all the hospital visits must just add to the stress","p072","p034",2.3333,2,3,1.3333
1080,289,42,21,"Person 2","Hospitals are already so depressing and also frustrating at times. never mind when your loved one is sick.","p072","p034",3,2,4,2.3333
1081,289,42,22,"Person 1","Yeah, and all the bills can stack up quick","p072","p034",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
1082,289,42,23,"Person 2","omg yes. Ambulance rides especially! Right at the time you're already stressed.","p072","p034",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
1083,289,42,24,"Person 1","All hospital visits are absurdly expensive","p072","p034",2,2,2,1.6667
1084,289,42,25,"Person 2","And so is insurance which is the only hope you have of staying out of debt","p072","p034",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
1085,289,42,26,"Person 1","Yeah, and insurance can also be shady too","p072","p034",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
1086,289,42,27,"Person 2","What sucks is just when you are stressed and worried, you have to deal with all of it and it's so complicated. SO many times the insurance and hospital won't communicate so you have to deal with all the calls and everything yourself","p072","p034",3.3333,2,2.3333,3
1087,289,42,28,"Person 1","Yeah and the answer machine is always a pain. Also the number of callers ahead of me.","p072","p034",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
1088,289,42,29,"Person 2","lol yes. THere's so much more to being sick than just being sick.","p072","p034",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
1089,289,42,30,"Person 1","Alright, goodbye","p072","p034",1,1,0.6667,1
1090,289,42,31,"Person 2","bye","p072","p034",1,1,0.6667,1
1091,289,43,0,"Person 1","I was happy she was strong when dealing with cancer.","p035","p050",2.3333,0,3.6667,2
1092,289,43,1,"Person 2","I am too..I love her courage. Please, let us be fast with this, my time is almost up","p035","p050",2.6667,0,3.6667,2.3333
1093,289,43,2,"Person 1","It was good she was so self looking","p035","p050",2,0.3333,3.6667,2
1094,289,43,3,"Person 2","yea..not so many people can do that","p035","p050",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2
1095,289,43,4,"Person 1","It made me wonder how I would deal with cancer","p035","p050",2.3333,1,3,3.3333
1096,289,43,5,"Person 2","I cant imagine that. I am scared of it!!!!","p035","p050",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
1097,289,43,6,"Person 1","it had to be scary thinking it was gone to have it come back","p035","p050",3,1.3333,4,2.3333
1098,289,43,7,"Person 2","Yea. I hate the fact that no one has been able to pin down the main cause","p035","p050",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
1099,289,43,8,"Person 1","Yeah, it  is scary that it can happen to anybody no matter the age or sex","p035","p050",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
1100,289,43,9,"Person 2","I only hope more research can be done to prevent this.","p035","p050",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,2
1101,289,43,10,"Person 1","I can relate to the host because my mom had cancer.","p035","p050",3,1.6667,3,3

1104,289,43,13,"Person 2","thats impressive. Can we say our byes now?","p035","p050",2,0.6667,1.6667,1
1105,289,43,14,"Person 1","i don know if we had enough turns but we can try.","p035","p050",2,0.6667,0.6667,1

1108,289,43,17,"Person 2","bye","p035","p050",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
1109,289,44,0,"Person 1","Oh man. I'm surprised this HIT brought up cancer. Thats such a huge and saddening topic.","p007","p050",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
1110,289,44,1,"Person 2","I always find it painful","p007","p050",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
1111,289,44,2,"Person 1","It really is. I'm glad that woman in the article had sucha  positive outlook on it though. I've dealt with several family members getting cancer when I was a kid and there was a lot of suffering.","p007","p050",3,1,4,3.6667
1112,289,44,3,"Person 2","Yea, the woman is really a fighter. I love her. I lost an uncle to cancer last year","p007","p050",3,1.6667,3.6667,4
1113,289,44,4,"Person 1","I lost my dad last year to a brain tumor. And my Grandmother had a rare bone marrow cancer. You'd think with all the medical technology we have now adays we could find a cure wit hlike gene therapy or something.","p007","p050",2,2,3,4
1114,289,44,5,"Person 2","wow..that is sad. So sorry about that. Yea. I feel the pharmaceutical companies are deliberately keep it secret.","p007","p050",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
1115,289,44,6,"Person 1","Honestly with the amount of money that is generated from cancer treatments and donations they probably are. God that would be absolutely horrible though.","p007","p050",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
1116,289,44,7,"Person 2","It really is pitiable. Its disturbing that human lives is not valued.","p007","p050",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
1117,289,44,8,"Person 1","It really is. Very sad that people value currency over their fellow man. Back toa bout the woman though, I wonder what drives her to have such a positive outlook. My father was very depressed when he got ill, which is a very normal reaction. I just wonder what enabled this woman to be so optimistic about it all.","p007","p050",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,3
1118,289,44,9,"Person 2","Might be a moment of self discovery for her.","p007","p050",2,0.3333,3,1.3333
1119,289,44,10,"Person 1","That is a good point. I suppose getting told that you might be dying would make anyone think about their life and everything.","p007","p050",3,0.3333,3,1.6667
1120,289,44,11,"Person 2","It definitely will, but not so many people are willing to embrace it.","p007","p050",2,0.6667,3,1.3333
1121,289,44,12,"Person 1","I guess religion also helps. If you are that kind of person of course. It's such a rough disease though. And we still use chemo. I wish we'd find some better treatments at least. When my dad went through chemo he got so much worse. Mentally and illness wise.","p007","p050",3,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
1122,289,44,13,"Person 2","Yeah, many people tend to shy away from that though. Religion is a huge factor.","p007","p050",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

1231,210,48,5,"Person 2","There was a FBI report about the new Joker movie that is opening soon.","p028","p035",1.3333,1.6667,1,1

1236,210,48,10,"Person 1","That is definetely one of the scarier attacks.

1240,210,48,14,"Person 1","I agree, ideally i would love if these people got help and were able to fix whatever is wrong with them but do not take it out on others. It feels like there is still a mental health stigma that makes people unlikely to get help","p028","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3

1243,210,48,17,"Person 2","I agree with that. I think the gun problem is too late to stop.","p028","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
1244,210,48,18,"Person 1","I agree, they are ingrained within society and people feel strongly about them. Alongside that at the end of the day it feels like these individuals would commit these acts with or without access to a firearm","p028","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
1245,210,48,19,"Person 2","Yeah this is a human problem.","p028","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667

1262,210,49,14,"Person 1","its easy to figure that out ban young males from coming in","p039","p020",3,1,1,2
1263,210,49,15,"Person 2","what are your thoughts on the school shootings going on in america","p039","p020",2,0.6667,1,1.3333
1264,210,49,16,"Person 1","its the drugs that they are taking no one talks about it","p039","p020",3,1,1.3333,2

1268,210,49,20,"Person 1","yep get some food and livestock if you can chickens too","p039","p020",1.6667,1,1,2
1269,210,49,21,"Person 2","good idea. I have a lot of food storage and emergency preparedness kits but having live animals would be a good idea.","p039","p020",2,0.3333,1,2
1270,210,49,22,"Person 1","yea at least the chickens for the eggs","p039","p020",2,0.3333,1,1.3333

1274,210,50,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article?","p022","p024",1,1,1,1
1275,210,50,1,"Person 2","I think it was a little messed up for the frontman of the band to say that he thought security collaborated with the attackers.","p022","p024",2.6667,2,1.3333,2
1277,210,50,3,"Person 2","What do you think can be done to prevent these attacks in the future","p022","p024",2,1,1,1
1278,210,50,4,"Person 1","I honestly don't know. I would say ban guns but poeple will just find other ways.","p022","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1,2
1279,210,50,5,"Person 2","yeah they'd probably just switch to knives","p022","p024",2,1.6667,1,1.6667
1280,210,50,6,"Person 1","OR even making things like bombs, or just running people over with cars.","p022","p024",2.3333,2,1,2
1281,210,50,7,"Person 2","yeah they seem to use vans to run people over a lot","p022","p024",1.6667,2,1,2
1282,210,50,8,"Person 1","I think people will always find ways to kill.. no matter what you do. Doesn't matter what you ban","p022","p024",2.3333,2,1,2.3333
1283,210,50,9,"Person 2","yeah some people are just naturally violent","p022","p024",2,2,1,1.3333
1284,210,50,10,"Person 1","It's terrible. I feel like they should be put away","p022","p024",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
1285,210,50,11,"Person 2","yeah what do you think is the approrpriate punishment","p022","p024",2,1,1,1
1286,210,50,12,"Person 1","I think if someone were to commit mass murder, death is the only punishment. You?","p022","p024",3,1.6667,1,3
1287,210,50,13,"Person 2","i think death is too quick. maybe life in solitary confinement","p022","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1,2.6667
1288,210,50,14,"Person 1","I just feel like if you are able to take the lives of 50+ people, you honestly don't deserve a second chance\\","p022","p024",0,0,2.3333,2
1294,49,51,0,"Person 1","How you feel about the article?","p005","p061",1,1,0.6667,1
1295,49,51,1,"Person 2","I feel sad and worried about the polar bears. You?","p005","p061",2.6667,2,4,2.6667
1296,49,51,2,"Person 1","I feel same way","p005","p061",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
1297,49,51,3,"Person 2","I'm really concerned that there are people who still don't believe this is happening and think global warming is a hoax.","p005","p061",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
1298,49,51,4,"Person 1","There should be more awareness in this regards","p005","p061",2,0.6667,2,1.3333
1299,49,51,5,"Person 2","The problem is people who don't want to listen. And now the polar bears are suffering.","p005","p061",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
1300,49,51,6,"Person 1","I'm really sad for the polar bears","p005","p061",3.3333,2,3.6667,3
1301,49,51,7,"Person 2","There needs to be more awareness raised but it seems like it is just too late.","p005","p061",2,2,2.6667,1.6667
1302,49,51,8,"Person 1","I do not think it is too late","p005","p061",2,0,1.6667,2.3333
1303,49,51,9,"Person 2","What do you think we can do?","p005","p061",1.3333,1,1,1
1304,49,51,10,"Person 1","I think we should create more awareness, so it will help the generations coming more","p005","p061",2.3333,0,2.3333,2.3333
1305,49,51,11,"Person 2","Yes. But I am afraid it will be too late and the damage will be done.","p005","p061",2,2,2.3333,2
1306,49,51,12,"Person 1","If we start now there is a lot we can still achieve","p005","p061",2,0,2.3333,2
1307,49,51,13,"Person 2","What should we start with aside from awareness? More clean energy maybe?","p005","p061",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1
1308,49,51,14,"Person 1","I will suggest renewable energy","p005","p061",1.6667,0.3333,1,1.6667
1309,49,51,15,"Person 2","I agree, but I think there also needs to be laws and regulations in place because there are people who just don't care","p005","p061",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
1310,49,51,16,"Person 1","Yes there should strict laws that will enforce this acts","p005","p061",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
1311,49,51,17,"Person 2","It's not going to happen here in the US with the current president unfortunately.","p005","p061",2.6667,2,1.3333,2
1312,49,51,18,"Person 1","it is quite sad, but this is a global problem","p005","p061",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
1313,49,51,19,"Person 2","It is, which makes it even harder.","p005","p061",2,2,2,1.3333
1314,49,51,20,"Person 1","So true, this honestly requires collective effort","p005","p061",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
1315,49,51,21,"Person 2","I guess we can just do our part by raising awareness and not being wasteful","p005","p061",2.3333,0,1.6667,2
1316,49,51,22,"Person 1","we should start from our homes i guess and our immediate enviroment","p005","p061",2,0.3333,2.3333,2
1317,49,51,23,"Person 2","Yes that's a good start and the more people doing it the better","p005","p061",2,0,2,1.6667
1318,49,51,24,"Person 1","That is so true, in my home i make use of energy saving bulbs. this will help conserve more energy","p005","p061",2,0.3333,2.3333,3
1319,49,51,25,"Person 2","That's a great idea. We turn off all the lights during the day and make sure we always turn them off when we leave the room. And we unplug appliances that aren't being used","p005","p061",2,0,2.6667,3
1320,49,51,26,"Person 1","That sounds interesting as well","p005","p061",2,0.3333,1.6667,1
1321,49,51,27,"Person 2","I try to teach my kids about saving energy too. And we make sure we recycle and neve litter","p005","p061",2,0,2.6667,3.3333
1322,49,51,28,"Person 1","That is a great idea, like i said earlier we need to create a great environment for the generations to come","p005","p061",2,0,2.6667,2
1323,49,51,29,"Person 2","Yes that's true, there needs to be more encouragement for kids though, in school and at home","p005","p061",1.6667,0,2,2.3333
1324,49,51,30,"Person 1","We will continue to hope things get better on the long run, it has been great chatting with you. goodbye","p005","p061",1.6667,0,1.6667,1
1325,49,51,31,"Person 2","You too","p005","p061",1,0.6667,0.3333,1
1326,49,51,32,"Person 1","you need to type bye or goodbye","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1327,49,51,33,"Person 2","Bye","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1328,49,51,34,"Person 1","lower case","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1329,49,51,35,"Person 2","bye","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1330,49,51,36,"Person 1","let us do it again","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1331,49,51,37,"Person 2","goodbye","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1332,49,51,38,"Person 1","bye","p005","p061",1,1,0.3333,1
1333,49,52,0,"Person 1","Hey, I didn't realize that polar bears depended on the arctic ice so much for their hunting..","p043","p074",1.3333,1,3,1.6667
1334,49,52,1,"Person 2","there isn't much else of anything up there. animal variety is pretty scarce","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1
1335,49,52,2,"Person 1","Yeah but I thought of them as nimble creatures. Like an better version of a bear. And basically they way they hunt is by ambushing seals at ice openings.","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
1336,49,52,3,"Person 2","they are certainly the biggest type of bear, which always seem odd to me","p043","p074",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
1337,49,52,4,"Person 1","Yeah and they definitely require a big food source.","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
1338,49,52,5,"Person 2","this article was very science oriented compared to others","p043","p074",1,0.6667,2.3333,1
1339,49,52,6,"Person 1","Yeah, it'd have to be whenever NASA gets mentioned in an article lol.","p043","p074",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
1340,49,52,7,"Person 2","i think this kind of article are interesting, but they don't receive the same coverage as say the Polar Bear on the Coke bottles and cans during Christmas","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
1341,49,52,8,"Person 1","I think the ice caps melting has been covered a lot. Al Gore kept talking about the polar bears in his first global warming movie.","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
1342,49,52,9,"Person 2","been covered multiple times doesn't mean it is getting fixed though. the population is still in heavy decline","p043","p074",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
1343,49,52,10,"Person 1","Yeah but beyond reversing global warming, I'm not sure how they can fix it. Maybe introduce new land animals for the polar bears to hunt?","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
1344,49,52,11,"Person 2","like penguins? same issue with seals about swimming. there isn't a lot that can survive the temperatures. more than fix it at this point is stabilize and halt it","p043","p074",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
1345,49,52,12,"Person 1","That's true but these animals wouldn't necessarily need to live long. Just long enough to wind up in the jaws of a hungry polar bear.","p043","p074",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
1346,49,52,13,"Person 2","we can be importing penguins annually. what country would take such a thankless job and cost","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
1347,49,52,14,"Person 1","It would indeed be expensive. If the idea was floated to animal conservation groups, I think it could be funded.","p043","p074",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
1348,49,52,15,"Person 2","maybe i'm just a pessimist but the logistics just seems insane","p043","p074",1.3333,2,1.3333,2
1349,49,52,16,"Person 1","Yeah there could be transportation issues. Acquiring the penguins would be the easy part. Right now I think the majority of polar bears are still surviving. If there was a possibility of them going extinct due to a lack of food, I have no doubt that we could save them, somehow.","p043","p074",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
1350,49,52,17,"Person 2","conservation efforts for near extinction tend to go to keeping them in zoos until the habitat can sustain them again","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
1351,49,52,18,"Person 1","Have you ever seen a polar bear in a zoo? I'm not sure if I have.","p043","p074",1,1.3333,1,1.6667
1352,49,52,19,"Person 2","yea, i can't recall, but i have watched the live cams for them before. their enclosures are mostly big pools of water","p043","p074",1,1.3333,1,2.6667
1353,49,52,20,"Person 1","Yeah, I just googled it and there's lots of cool videos on youtube. Also sometimes they build big enclosures for one type of animal. There could be a polar bear national park or something in the arctic.","p043","p074",1.3333,0.3333,1,2.3333
1354,49,52,21,"Person 2","them some brave people with money to go to one that far up north","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.6667
1355,49,52,22,"Person 1","Some animal animal conservation groups have deep pockets.","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333
1356,49,52,23,"Person 2","i wonder if there are other studies not dealing with polar bears, but like the seals instead. (this is chat #12 for me. almost done)","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333
1357,49,52,24,"Person 1","Probably, getting grants for studying environmental problems are probably easier to acquire than for other subjects. I just googled some polar bear stuff and there was an article from 2018 talking about the problem. They said the main issue with low polar bear populations is inbreeding. Also they discussed Canada air dropping food and said it would cost 2 million a month.","p043","p074",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
1358,49,52,25,"Person 2","yea, if populations are low inbreeding is yet another issue. bad genes get a hold of the population. interesting that they even considered air dropping. i guess it only has to be in the active time of the year. so around 10 - 12 million","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
1359,49,52,26,"Person 1","I think they're only going to drop food when they notice that the bears are starving. Also that 2 million was to just feed 5,000 polar bears.","p043","p074",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
1360,49,52,27,"Person 2","that's still have to be a lot of food. did they say what kind of meat? seal? where are they even getting it?","p043","p074",1.3333,0.6667,2,1
1361,49,52,28,"Person 1","They might have, I was skimming it fast so I could've missed it. It's great that the Canadian government is doing something about it though. I bet our government is also taking steps to save the majestic animal. Thanks for the conversation, hope you have a good day.","p043","p074",2,0.3333,2.3333,2
1362,49,52,29,"Person 2","we both have to say bye","p043","p074",1,1,0.6667,1
1363,49,52,30,"Person 1","bye","p043","p074",1,1,0.6667,1
1364,49,52,31,"Person 2","7","p043","p074",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1365,49,52,32,"Person 1","bye","p043","p074",1,1,0.6667,1
1366,49,53,0,"Person 1","I feel sorry for the polar bears. I wonder what behavioral changes biologists are noticing in their behavior.  Certainly the bears will change something to try to survive, although the Arctic doesn't give them too many options, probably.","p062","p009",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
1367,49,53,1,"Person 2","I feel awful for them too. I hope scientists are able to fix the problem","p062","p009",2.6667,2,4,2.3333
1368,49,53,2,"Person 1","I wonder if we can even do anything about it?  Even if we decrease CO2 production, their environment might continue to melt away.","p062","p009",1.6667,2,2.3333,1
1369,49,53,3,"Person 2","I don't know, I'm not qualified to answer that - I just hope something can be done for them","p062","p009",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
1370,49,53,4,"Person 1","They're definitely majestic animals.  It seems ironic that something that's so big and powerful can seem so impotent in the face of the vicissitudes of mother nature.","p062","p009",2.3333,0.6667,3,1.6667
1371,49,53,5,"Person 2","I agree. I want them to be around for a long time","p062","p009",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
1372,49,53,6,"Person 1","Still, we tend to think that the world is supposed to be the way we know it now.  We, like polar bears, have only existed for the tiniest fraction of the earth's and universe's history.  And yet we thing it's anomalous for us to not be here.","p062","p009",2.3333,1,2.6667,1.6667
1373,49,53,7,"Person 2","I agree. I don't wish for any creature to suffer or go extinct","p062","p009",2,0.6667,2.6667,2.6667
1374,49,53,8,"Person 1","I imagine that the increasing push to get oil out of the Arctic will further threaten the polar bears' habitat.","p062","p009",2,2,2.3333,1
1375,49,53,9,"Person 2","I agree, but I hope not. hopefully we can rely on a more renewable source of energy soon","p062","p009",2,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
1376,49,53,10,"Person 1","I don't think most people have the will, and developing countries are the biggest question, not the already-developed world.","p062","p009",2,2,1.6667,2
1377,49,53,11,"Person 2","that is true, still I hope something changes","p062","p009",2,0,2,2.6667
1378,49,53,12,"Person 1","Are you doing anything about it or just hoping?","p062","p009",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1
1379,49,53,13,"Person 2","I do what little I can. but of course I still have to use gas to get around and stuff","p062","p009",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
1380,49,53,14,"Person 1","Right, and that's the biggest impediment to any substantive change.  People aren't willing to live a lifestyle other than the one they know.  I've thrown up my hands and think it's all pointless.  The dye is cast.  Now we reap what we've sown.","p062","p009",2,2,1.6667,3.3333
1381,49,53,15,"Person 2","maybe. but now most car manufacturers are making electric vehicles, so in the near future there will be less of a need for gas","p062","p009",1.6667,0,1.6667,1
1382,49,53,16,"Person 1","Agree, but apparently there are much larger problems than just cars.  Apparently the concrete industry is like the single-worst thing, and nobody talks about that at all.","p062","p009",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
1383,49,53,17,"Person 2","there are also problems like pollution, especially in India and china","p062","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1
1384,49,53,18,"Person 1","Yes, those countries are terrible.  We worry over here about plastic straws and stuff like that, but that stuff is totally irrelevant.","p062","p009",2,2,1.3333,2
1385,49,53,19,"Person 2","they have had to release flesh-eating turtles into the Ganges river to get rid of all of the dead bodies","p062","p009",2,2,0.6667,1
1386,49,53,20,"Person 1","That's pretty horrific.","p062","p009",2.6667,2,1,2.3333
1387,49,53,21,"Person 2","yeah I know, its a huge problem there","p062","p009",2,2,1,1
1388,49,53,22,"Person 1","Anyway, I'm about done.  Unless you want to say anything else I'll end the conversation in the next round.","p062","p009",1,1.3333,0.6667,1
1389,49,53,23,"Person 2","ok, thanks. have a great rest of your day","p062","p009",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
1390,49,53,24,"Person 1","you too.  bye","p062","p009",1,1,0.3333,1.3333
1391,49,53,25,"Person 2","goodbye","p062","p009",1,1,0.3333,1
1392,49,54,0,"Person 1","So, how do you feel about the disappearance of the familiar frozen arctic?","p030","p005",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1393,49,54,1,"Person 2","I feel terrible about it, and you?","p030","p005",3.3333,2,4,2
1394,49,54,2,"Person 1","I feel similarly, mostly because I feel so helpless. Like, the damage has already been done and we are cursed to watch the tragedy unfold.","p030","p005",3.6667,2,4.3333,2.6667
1395,49,54,3,"Person 2","I am so sad that the polar bears are really suffering because of this","p030","p005",3.6667,2,4.3333,2.6667
1396,49,54,4,"Person 1","Them along with 30,000 other species that are on the brink of extinction because of the changing climate and the encroachment of humanity. How do you deal with it?","p030","p005",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667
1397,49,54,5,"Person 2","This is a lot to swallow. We need to find a way of solving this","p030","p005",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
1398,49,54,6,"Person 1","So, your hopeful that there is a practical solution?","p030","p005",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
1399,49,54,7,"Person 2","I really hope, hopefully more awareness?","p030","p005",2,0,2,1.6667
1400,49,54,8,"Person 1","I don't know, I think that awareness is pretty high even in remote and developing countries. I think that the biggest obstacle at present is outright denial being popularized by psuedo-authoritarian governments.","p030","p005",2.3333,2,2,3
1401,49,54,9,"Person 2","This too, but that should not stop more awareness as this is a global issue","p030","p005",2,1.3333,2,2
1402,49,54,10,"Person 1","Oh, i'm not advocating for less dissemination of information. The more things like this are highlighted without political bias the more people will be receptive to taking action.","p030","p005",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
1403,49,54,11,"Person 2","Agreed, so tell me what your suggestions are?","p030","p005",1,1,0.6667,1.6667
1404,49,54,12,"Person 1","I think that we need to take a more active approach in the control of the climate. We need to stop treating it as something supernal because humans can obviously bend it to their own selfish wills. Such as, dumping iron oxide into the ocean to create super massive blooms of plankton. This will not only effectively remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, but sequester it in living things that will thrive off of the nutrition; passing that down the line and enriching our depleted oceans.","p030","p005",2.6667,0.3333,2,2.6667
1405,49,54,13,"Person 2","And this change should begin with us, from our homes","p030","p005",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
1406,49,54,14,"Person 1","Go on..","p030","p005",1,1,0.6667,1
1407,49,54,15,"Person 2","I think making use of energy saving bulbs, not throwing dirt anywhere just do something to help conserve the energy more and help the climate","p030","p005",1.3333,0.3333,2,2
1408,49,54,16,"Person 1","I agree that making more environmental choices in the home will help people adjust for a low energy future, but even at scale those kinds of actions won't do anything to prevent the acceleration of climate change. It's nice for an American to do these paltry things and go to bed at night with a sense of satisfaction, but the events that have been set in motion will have dire consequences for those less fortunate.","p030","p005",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
1409,49,54,17,"Person 2","oh wow. I just really feel sad for the bears really","p030","p005",3,2,4.3333,2
1410,49,54,18,"Person 1","That's why they're used as a poster child for something much larger. Polar bears are cute and fluffy and easy to feel compassion for from a great distance. Humans being cooked to death and dying from thirst isn't as cuddly.","p030","p005",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
1411,49,54,19,"Person 2","We need to do something the generation coming will be proud of as regards climate change","p030","p005",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
1412,49,54,20,"Person 1","I agree! Thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p005",1.6667,0,0.6667,1
1413,49,54,21,"Person 2","bye","p030","p005",1,1,0.3333,1
1414,49,55,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the articel?","p022","p016",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
1415,49,55,1,"Person 2","Really sad and really frustrating. :( I wish we were doing more to stop it.","p022","p016",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
1416,49,55,2,"Person 1","It's so sad because we're just doing more harm instead of helping","p022","p016",4,2,3.6667,2.6667
1417,49,55,3,"Person 2","Yeah. Both of my parents and most the my family actually denies it's happening. Thanksgiving's going to be real fun this year.","p022","p016",3.6667,2,2.3333,3.3333
1418,49,55,4,"Person 1","Oh wow, how do they explain things that are happening like in the article?","p022","p016",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
1419,49,55,5,"Person 2","Just say it's natural/the earth \"always does this.\" It's mind blowing.","p022","p016",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
1420,49,55,6,"Person 1","I never asked my parents but i'm sure they think the same to be honest","p022","p016",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
1421,49,55,7,"Person 2","Unfortunately. :( And it's so frustrating bc it means we're blocked from getting things done to change it.","p022","p016",4,2,2,3
1422,49,55,8,"Person 1","Yup! This is why i think we need a younger presidential candidate in office for the next election. Smeone who will be able to understand things like climate change and not live in the old ways.","p022","p016",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,3
1423,49,55,9,"Person 2","Indeed. Have you been following the movement around Greta Thornburg?","p022","p016",2,1,0.6667,1.6667
1424,49,55,10,"Person 1","I recently saw it. I understand and side with her but i felt it was a bit aggressive","p022","p016",2,1.3333,0.6667,3.3333
1425,49,55,11,"Person 2","She definitely feels very strongly about it. It's just a little mindboggling to me that one of the most well known voices is 16.","p022","p016",2.3333,0.3333,0.6667,2
1426,49,55,12,"Person 1","Yeah but it also gives me hope for the next generation as well!","p022","p016",3,0,0.6667,3
1427,49,55,13,"Person 2","Yeah, there's a lot of movement and political awareness it seems like.","p022","p016",1.6667,0,0.6667,2.3333
1428,49,55,14,"Person 1","So would you say you are doing anything to help the climate","p022","p016",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
1429,49,55,15,"Person 2","I do most of the basic stuff--try to get local food, avoid waste, cut down on gas/electrics as much as possible. Cutting down on gas is hard though since I live in a smaller town w no public transportation.","p022","p016",2.3333,0,2,3.3333
1430,49,55,16,"Person 1","That's good. I definitely need to start doing more because i am still in the mindset that what i do won't make much of a difference since i'm only one person","p022","p016",2,0,2.6667,3
1431,49,55,17,"Person 2","It definitely can feel that way, especially considering how much pollution the big companies are pumping out.","p022","p016",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
1432,49,55,18,"Person 1","Yup. Let's hope the future gets better for everyone.. and everything. It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p016",2.3333,0,2.3333,2.3333
1433,49,55,19,"Person 2","bye!","p022","p016",0.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1434,72,56,0,"Person 1","Hi there, so what did you think about the article?","p029","p041",1,1,0.6667,1
1435,72,56,1,"Person 2","Hello, I thought it was very interesting but not really surprising","p029","p041",1.6667,1,1,2
1436,72,56,2,"Person 1","Yeah no doubt.  The only part I was surprised by (but I know practically nothing on this subject) was that elephant populations had increased in some areas and were a nuisance to the locals","p029","p041",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
1437,72,56,3,"Person 2","I thought it was interesting that some African nations actually want to lift the ban on ivory trading and argued that it would help elephant populations. lol","p029","p041",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
1438,72,56,4,"Person 1","yeah that does not make sense to me.  why on earth","p029","p041",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
1439,72,56,5,"Person 2","It may have to do with competition from mammoth ivory in Russia","p029","p041",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
1440,72,56,6,"Person 1","you clearly know more about this than me, but yeah I guess that would make sense.","p029","p041",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
1441,72,56,7,"Person 2","Do you think it makes sense to have some elephants listed as appendix 1 animals and others not?","p029","p041",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
1442,72,56,8,"Person 1","I don't know enough about it to say.  Elephants from certain countries were appendix 1 and others were appendix 2, correct?  what do you think?","p029","p041",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
1443,72,56,9,"Person 2","As it was stated in the article elephants don't have passports. It doesn't make sense for them to have different protections on different sides of a border. This would just create ''arbitrage'' opportunities that poachers would no doubt exploit","p029","p041",2,1.6667,2,2.6667
1444,72,56,10,"Person 1","Yeah I agree.  All they have to do is walk across an imaginary line and they suddenly have a different level of protection.  That does not make logical sense.","p029","p041",2,2,2,2.3333
1445,72,56,11,"Person 2","I wonder if Africa's development and modernization are correlated with poaching at all. I would like to believe this would decrease poaching as an industry","p029","p041",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.6667
1446,72,56,12,"Person 1","I would like to think that too, but I would imagine there is a very long way to go before there is a big difference","p029","p041",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
1447,72,56,13,"Person 2","What makes you say that?","p029","p041",1,1,0.6667,1
1448,72,56,14,"Person 1","I don't see poaching decreasing or disappearing dramatically overnight.  I think it would take a long period of time and be a gradual change","p029","p041",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
1449,72,56,15,"Person 2","Kenya just recently instituted the death penalty for poachers. What do you think would be some good ways to discourage poaching?","p029","p041",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
1450,72,56,16,"Person 1","That sounds sufficient.  Like I said, I know nothing about this topic so it is great that you are educating me.","p029","p041",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
1451,72,56,17,"Person 2","I don't know much myself. I don't support the death penalty generally and in this case I don't see how it would help. Poachers will move further south and increase their activities in other parts of the continent. I think on balance this will just lead to more poaching","p029","p041",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3.3333
1452,72,56,18,"Person 1","I guess you would have to see if the amount of poaching actually decreases in response to the death penalty.  It would depend on how it were enforced.","p029","p041",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
1453,72,56,19,"Person 2","I think that is the biggest problem that conservation efforts in Africa face. Enforcement. If the African nations even agree on what measures to take, they almost never enforce them rigorously.","p029","p041",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
1454,72,56,20,"Person 1","Exactly, and then there is corruption in the government as well so that would be an issue.","p029","p041",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
1455,72,56,21,"Person 2","Do you think the international community has a duty to intervene at this point?","p029","p041",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
1456,72,56,22,"Person 1","No, but I disagree with the international community getting involved in each other's affairs in general.  This is an African issue that should be solved by the parties there in my opinion.  What do you think","p029","p041",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
1457,72,56,23,"Person 2","I don't think the African nations can take the helm. The more time they spend disagreeing the more threatened elephant populations become. I really think the UN should be more actively involved. Perhaps not with legislation, but definitely with enforcement.","p029","p041",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
1458,72,56,24,"Person 1","Well that's certainly one way to look at it.  Regardless,  I hope they are able to work something out that is satisfactory to all the nations involved","p029","p041",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
1459,72,56,25,"Person 2","I hope so. We can not continue to do nothing as a global society. More and more animals are going extinct. I just read an article that stated that the last known female Yangtze Turtle in the wild died recently.","p029","p041",3,2,3,2.3333
1460,72,56,26,"Person 1","Well that is sad.  There are species going extinct all the time.","p029","p041",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
1461,72,56,27,"Person 2","Yes that is true, but more and more are going extinct because of human activities. That has to change","p029","p041",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
1462,72,56,28,"Person 1","And also due to natural changes in the environment which are outside of our control.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye","p029","p041",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
1463,72,56,29,"Person 2","I hope you enjoy your day as well. bye","p029","p041",1.6667,1,0.6667,1
1464,72,57,0,"Person 1","I think its sad the way elephants lack good protection","p024","p043",3.6667,2,3,3
1465,72,57,1,"Person 2","Yeah, it's really unfortunate that some countries value ivory so highly.","p024","p043",3,2,3.3333,2.6667
1466,72,57,2,"Person 1","it just goes to show money rules over all to this day","p024","p043",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
1467,72,57,3,"Person 2","Yup. Were you surprised that the EU wasn't in favor of classifying all elephants as appendix 1?","p024","p043",3,1,1.6667,2.3333
1468,72,57,4,"Person 1","yeah its weird an elephant that crosses a border may have protection on one side and not the other as well","p024","p043",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
1469,72,57,5,"Person 2","What's weird is that they think poachers care about imaginary lines when they're already committing a crime.","p024","p043",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
1470,72,57,6,"Person 1","these poachers never face any repercussion","p024","p043",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
1471,72,57,7,"Person 2","They are really well equipped too, they are almost like soldiers now. I think the article said that poachers fire on sight when encountered.","p024","p043",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
1472,72,57,8,"Person 1","yeah the criminal networks are really organized and fluid","p024","p043",2.6667,2,1.3333,2
1473,72,57,9,"Person 2","If only there was a way to devalue Ivory, so there wasn't any point in killing elephants. I remember reading an article a long time ago when groups tried to flood the ivory market with fakes to lower prices.","p024","p043",3,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
1474,72,57,10,"Person 1","i am sure there is a way thats a good idea actually.","p024","p043",2.6667,0,1.6667,3
1475,72,57,11,"Person 2","Yeah. I think there was also another tactic they tried, which was painting the tusks pink or something.","p024","p043",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.6667
1476,72,57,12,"Person 1","What do you think about these governments saying the elephants damage the crops","p024","p043",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
1477,72,57,13,"Person 2","I've heard of those rampaging elephant stories in the past. What happens is that people keep cultivating land that elephants previous used. So the elephants are forced to interact with people to find food.","p024","p043",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
1478,72,57,14,"Person 1","Do you think the global community will step up and help?","p024","p043",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
1479,72,57,15,"Person 2","Probably not, unless it becomes a really dire situation. The EU had their chance of really stepping up the penalties that poachers would face and they didn't take their chance.","p024","p043",2.3333,2,2,2
1480,72,57,16,"Person 1","One can only hope for the best. I think that's our fifteen turns good job. Bye","p024","p043",2.3333,0.3333,1,1.3333
1481,72,57,17,"Person 2","It's supposed to be 10 turns each lol. Also I just googled what ivory went for....In 2016, they went for $1,500 a pound and they can weigh up to 250 pounds...Easy 400k.","p024","p043",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.6667
1482,72,57,18,"Person 1","That price is only going to go up too","p024","p043",2,2,1.3333,2
1483,72,57,19,"Person 2","Yeah it's probably doubled since its getting harder and harder to sell it.","p024","p043",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
1484,72,57,20,"Person 1","considering 140 k elephants have been killed between 2007 and 2014 it should be harder. And it is 15 turns just checked.","p024","p043",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
1485,72,57,21,"Person 2","Yeah, I can't even imagine that many dead elephants...There was also the statistic that one gets killed very 15 minutes. Elephants are such smart creatures too, they have funerals for dead family members. It's so sad....Also the terms are on the left side, 10 turns minimum which we've reached or 15 turns each for a bonus.","p024","p043",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
1486,72,57,22,"Person 1","bye","p024","p043",1.3333,1,0.3333,1
1487,72,57,23,"Person 2","bye","p024","p043",1,1,0.3333,1
1488,72,58,0,"Person 1","The idea that we are still allowing so many endangered animals to be killed and especially an animal as gentle and amazing as an elephant is just heartbreaking. I feel so frustrated, angry and helpless over this situation. I do think it is time to crack down on those buying the ivory as strongly as those poaching.","p055","p058",4,2,4,3
1489,72,58,1,"Person 2","It really is ridiculous. But what more can be done? It's been banned in multiple countries. I've even heard of groups of people who arm themselves and go out to personally stop poachers, and yet it still continues. I'm not sure what else could be done to stop this from happening.","p055","p058",3,2,4,3
1490,72,58,2,"Person 1","There is no obvious simple solution and I think that is part of the problem. I think it's hindered by so many African countries that are poor and the amount of money made on the blackmarket for ivory just makes it difficult to stop.","p055","p058",3,2,2,3
1491,72,58,3,"Person 2","I think you are right about cracking down on the buyers. Maybe trying to stop the poachers is a losing effort, but going after the buyers may have an impact. But these criminal blackmarkets are probably very difficult to shut down.","p055","p058",2,2,2,2
1492,72,58,4,"Person 1","Oh yes, that is nearly as difficult as the poachers I'm sure. But even beyond the buyers, those that are buying ivory items and maybe not realizing what that means is a big factor I think. If we educate more people about what having an ivory figurine means, perhaps that can be a start as well.","p055","p058",2,2,3,3
1493,72,58,5,"Person 2","I'm sure that would go a long way. It's at least something that could be done that may have an impact. As we've seen from the drug trade, stopping illegal items from being sold is almost impossible. I'm sure there's levels of corruption involved as well. There's so much money to be made I bet a lot of these officials are cashing in and turning a blind eye as well.","p055","p058",3,2,3,3
1494,72,58,6,"Person 1","Oh exactly, it always comes down to the money. Stop them being able to make a profit and perhaps we can stop the senseless killing.","p055","p058",2,0,2,2
1495,72,58,7,"Person 2","And when it's the officials who are getting paid, the ones who are supposed to be stopping this, it makes it that much harder.","p055","p058",2,2,2,3
1496,72,58,8,"Person 1","Yes corruption I'm sure is very huge. It has to take everyone being on the same page to make a difference. As the article stated having each country giving elephants different levels of protection shows that no one is seeing this issue in the same way.","p055","p058",3,2,3,2
1497,72,58,9,"Person 2","I think if the west took more of an interest in this things could get done. Poaching still a problem? Cut the aid given to the country. If they make it a priority things will change.","p055","p058",2,1,3,3
1498,72,58,10,"Person 1","I do think the west will have to step in. Unfortunately, it takes a major outrage before we seem to be able to get all the west willing to do more.","p055","p058",2,1,2,2
1499,72,58,11,"Person 2","You're right. Not to mention with all the political nonsense going on right now, I think people are being overwhelmed with problems and issues and just kind of ignore it all.","p055","p058",2,2,1,3
1500,72,58,12,"Person 1","Well it's so easy to ignore it now. We don't like something on social media, we can just ignore those posting about it. Something has to be done to make it not so easy to ignore.","p055","p058",2,2,2,2
1501,72,58,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I also think it's because people don't know what to trust anymore. Can we really say the news sources are trustworthy? Officials are lying, news commentators are biased, social media is full of nonsense, who wants to deal with that?","p055","p058",2,2,2,3
1502,72,58,14,"Person 1","So very true. Who do we even believe anymore? Where can we turn to get information that we can believe in.","p055","p058",3,1,2,2
1503,72,58,15,"Person 2","That's the question. The news media seems more like propaganda to me these days. Almost like school children hurling insults back and forth. So something like the illegal ivory trade would definitely get pushed to the bottom of the news worthy list.","p055","p058",3,2,3,3
1504,72,58,16,"Person 1","I totally agree. It seems news media are more like the old tabloids going for shock value and trying to get the most following and not worried about real news issues and trying to educate the people. Things going on in Africa are so far away, it's easy to let those kinds of issues slide in favor of the latest scandal to get ratings.","p055","p058",3,2,3,3
1505,72,58,17,"Person 2","Yeah. I think awareness is key. Increase awareness and maybe it will effect change. I mean, I wasn't aware poaching was this bad of a problem until reading this article.","p055","p058",4,1,3,3
1506,72,58,18,"Person 1","Awareness, education and meaningful discussions of what the loss elephants can mean to the world are definitely a key.","p055","p058",2,0,2,2
1507,72,58,19,"Person 2","With all the problems occurring worldwide I don't have much faith in anything stopping poaching honestly.","p055","p058",3,2,2,2
1508,72,58,20,"Person 1","Unfortunately, I think I have to agree. Unless the poaching starts having an impact on our daily lives, I fear most will simply ignore it as something that doesn't matter.","p055","p058",3,2,3,3
1509,72,58,21,"Person 2","Yeah, it really is unfortunate. Those elephants don't deserve that, and I'm sure it's frustrating to the rangers trying to stop it. People just don't care anymore unless it's right smack dab in their face.","p055","p058",3,2,3,3
1510,72,58,22,"Person 1","Definitely. And the rangers that are putting their lives on the line to try and make a difference aren't being respected either.","p055","p058",4,2,2,3
1511,72,58,23,"Person 2","Yeah I remember the article said those rangers were being shot at on sight by the poachers. That's madness. Seems like it would be taken more seriously if it's that dangerous out there.","p055","p058",4,2,2,3
1512,72,58,24,"Person 1","I fear that it's so \"wild\" as the animals need it that it's hard to take care of the rangers anymore than the animals. But I agree, rangers just being shot at for doing their jobs is another outrage.","p055","p058",2,2,3,3
1513,72,58,25,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm sure funding is an issue as well. Hiring more rangers, or even bringing in some kind of military presence probably isn't an option.","p055","p058",2,2,3,3
1514,72,58,26,"Person 1","Seems issues always boil down to the same things. More money needed. More education needed. More knowledge. More awareness.","p055","p058",3,1,3,3
1515,72,58,27,"Person 2","Yeah, and when those things are lacking, everything just gets worse and worse.","p055","p058",3,2,2,2
1516,72,58,28,"Person 1","I have to agree. I hope that by raising our own awarness with conversations like these we can start seeing some change. I've enjoyed this conversation and want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas. I've enjoyed our talk, goodbye.","p055","p058",3,0,2,2
1517,72,58,29,"Person 2","I enjoyed it as well, goodbye.","p055","p058",0,0,0,1
1518,72,59,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article","p068","p019",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
1519,72,59,1,"Person 2","I think it's very sad... hbu","p068","p019",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
1520,72,59,2,"Person 1","i think its really sad too i love elephants andthey deserve to be protected","p068","p019",4,2,3.6667,3
1521,72,59,3,"Person 2","me too. All animals do! It's scary to think about them going extinct","p068","p019",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
1522,72,59,4,"Person 1","I cant believe they cant do more to protect them. There has to be a way","p068","p019",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
1523,72,59,5,"Person 2","Im sure they can, i bet they aren't for financial gain or something","p068","p019",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
1524,72,59,6,"Person 1","yea maybe theyre being swayed by some kind of hunting group. I wonder if more animal conservation groups spoke uptherewould be some kind ofway to protect them.","p068","p019",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
1525,72,59,7,"Person 2","Probably, if enough people rallied against it they could make a change for the better","p068","p019",2,0.3333,2.6667,2
1526,72,59,8,"Person 1","i also think that maybe the african government encourages poaching. It may be one of the biggest draws to their country.It probably helps them a lot economically.","p068","p019",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
1527,72,59,9,"Person 2","That is a good side of it, that very well could be... How sad really. Encouraging killing endangered animals for $$","p068","p019",2.6667,2,3,2
1528,72,59,10,"Person 1","Maybe other countriescan step in at this point. Im sure if puttingsanctions on africa for enouraging poaching would stop the problems alltogether.","p068","p019",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
1529,72,59,11,"Person 2","Im sure they could... but lots of people dont even see it as an issue... it's \"just an animal\"","p068","p019",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
1530,72,59,12,"Person 1","so sad but true elephants are really smart and really important to the eco system that theyre in, so going extinct would be a huge loss","p068","p019",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
1531,72,59,13,"Person 2","it would be! And it would just be an awful step for humanity, killing off another species","p068","p019",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
1532,72,59,14,"Person 1","yea another thing humans ruinon earth. you would think scientist would see this as a bigger issue","p068","p019",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
1533,72,59,15,"Person 2","I think they probably do but they don't have much pull","p068","p019",1.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
1534,72,59,16,"Person 1","true, if you have money you have control of the world. and its the animals that suffer from these greedy people","p068","p019",3,2,2,2.3333
1535,72,59,17,"Person 2","it's awful that that is the way the world works","p068","p019",3,2,2,2
1536,72,59,18,"Person 1","thanks for talking with me. i love animals and espiecally elephants so much i hope that they never go extinct. goodbye","p068","p019",2.6667,0.3333,3.3333,2.6667
1537,72,59,19,"Person 2","you as well bye","p068","p019",1,1,0.3333,1
1538,72,60,0,"Person 1","What did you think of this?","p029","p010",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
1539,72,60,1,"Person 2","It made me very sad.  All those beautiful Savannah Elephants slaughtered for ivory.","p029","p010",4.3333,2,4,2
1540,72,60,2,"Person 1","Yes, I thought it was a tragedy.  And for what??  greed","p029","p010",3,2,4,2.6667
1541,72,60,3,"Person 2","I swear human beings are the worst.  It's me, me, me, me.   They should be assessed astronomical finds and prison time.","p029","p010",4.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
1542,72,60,4,"Person 1","Yeah no doubt.  Then it would be oh poor me, woe is me.  I'm the victim.","p029","p010",3,2,2.3333,2
1543,72,60,5,"Person 2","Yes it would.   I live in Colorado so bears, elk, and mountain lions are everywhere.   Stupid people come to Colorado with no knowledge of large animals.   Then they get attacked, etc. and the Department of Wildlife  has to kill the animal.   Makes me so mad.","p029","p010",4,2,2.3333,3
1544,72,60,6,"Person 1","yeah that is unfair to the animal.  people should educate themselves first","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
1545,72,60,7,"Person 2","What else really caught your attention in the article?","p029","p010",1,1,0.6667,1.3333
1546,72,60,8,"Person 1","it just seemed there was no good solution to this","p029","p010",1.6667,2,2,2.3333
1547,72,60,9,"Person 2","I know.   I really was thinking about what could be done and how could it be tracked?   I couldn't think of anything.","p029","p010",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
1548,72,60,10,"Person 1","same here!  It is frustrating to have such a big problem with no solutioon","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
1549,72,60,11,"Person 2","It just seems the head of animals (I don't know the proper term) knows how the whole process works and could implement something.   I'm sure people are paid off etc.","p029","p010",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
1550,72,60,12,"Person 1","yeah for sure they are.  maybe harsher penalties??","p029","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1,2
1551,72,60,13,"Person 2","Has to be - If you are facing prison time in Africa not the US and excessive monetary penalties, that possibly could reduce it","p029","p010",2,1.3333,2,2
1552,72,60,14,"Person 1","maybe so, I wonder if they have tried that yet?","p029","p010",1,1,0.6667,2
1553,72,60,15,"Person 2","Not that I am aware of - I was hoping the article had a brief narrative regarding that instead of all the %s.","p029","p010",1,1,1.6667,2
1554,72,60,16,"Person 1","yeah I didn't see anything about it either","p029","p010",1,1,1.6667,2.3333
1555,72,60,17,"Person 2","The solution could be stop making things that are ivory.   If no one uses it,  less elephants would be killed.   Piano keys etc. could be made out of something differently.","p029","p010",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
1556,72,60,18,"Person 1","YES, eliminate the market.  I must go, take care!  bye","p029","p010",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
1557,72,60,19,"Person 2","Enjoyed chatted goodbye","p029","p010",2,0,0.3333,1.3333
1590,150,62,0,"Person 1","Hi there - I was very surprised to find out that China allowed women to become pilots at all","p032","p002",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
1591,150,62,1,"Person 2","Yea I was a bit surprised at that but more so surprised that she was killed by another plane's wing hitting her.","p032","p002",2.3333,2,2,2
1592,150,62,2,"Person 1","Agreed. What are the odds of that happening?","p032","p002",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
1593,150,62,3,"Person 2","Pretty low. The fact that she was hit by another plane would imply that proper protocols were not followed.","p032","p002",1.6667,2,1.6667,1
1594,150,62,4,"Person 1","Definitely. Do you have any experience in aviation?","p032","p002",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
1595,150,62,5,"Person 2","haha not particularly but it would seem that there should be measures in place to protect pilots that eject","p032","p002",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
1596,150,62,6,"Person 1","Absolutely - so someone messed up big time. It was heartwarming to hear that she is broadly seen as a hero","p032","p002",2.6667,0,2.6667,1.3333
1597,150,62,7,"Person 2","Yea at least they see her as one. Kind of a shame that it's such a big deal that a women is a pilot.","p032","p002",3,1.3333,3.3333,1.3333
1598,150,62,8,"Person 1","Yeah, sadly, I don't think of China as being at the forefront of the feminist movement. ;) I'm shocked women are let near a cockpit!","p032","p002",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
1599,150,62,9,"Person 2","Do you feel as if women need special safety measures compared to me?","p032","p002",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
1600,150,62,10,"Person 1","Nope. I just didn't think that women would been seen as capable enough to fly airplanes within that cultural context.","p032","p002",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
1601,150,62,11,"Person 2","Do you know if there are many women pilots in the US armed forces?","p032","p002",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
1602,150,62,12,"Person 1","That's a great question. I don't know that there are a lot, but I don't think they are entirely rare, either. But I'm really talking out of my rear here. :) I don't know much about the military - do you?","p032","p002",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
1603,150,62,13,"Person 2","Not many specifics. I can see how measures related to physical safety would be different for women related to g-force protection and the like","p032","p002",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
1604,150,62,14,"Person 1","Interesting, I hadn't thought of that! In what ways do you think they would be different?","p032","p002",2,0.6667,2,1.3333
1605,150,62,15,"Person 2","It would make sense that a smaller person would have different thresholds that they can handle","p032","p002",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
1606,150,62,16,"Person 1","Right. That makes sense. Switching gears: what do you think of the officials being unable to assign fault for the death? Wasn't the reason clear?","p032","p002",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1
1607,150,62,17,"Person 2","Probably just trying to avoid having to punish somebody for this. I think the reason of death is clear just not who caused it.","p032","p002",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
1608,150,62,18,"Person 1","The whole thing is sad. I wonder what protocol changes will be made (if any) because of it","p032","p002",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
1609,150,62,19,"Person 2","I'm not sure which protocols would need to be changed. Maybe the distance that planes can be close to one another?","p032","p002",2,1,1.6667,1
1610,150,62,20,"Person 1","That seems like a good place to start","p032","p002",2,0.6667,0.6667,1
1611,150,62,21,"Person 2","Do you think this hurts the chances of more women becoming pilots?","p032","p002",1.6667,1.6667,0.6667,1
1612,150,62,22,"Person 1","I hadn't thought of that. Maybe? I don't think it would keep women from wanting to become pilots - flying is always risky - but I wonder if public opinion will turn against women flying. What do you think?","p032","p002",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
1613,150,62,23,"Person 2","I think this may deter women from becoming pilots if special measures are not taken to protect them.","p032","p002",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
1614,150,62,24,"Person 1","I wonder if anything like this has happened to male pilots in China? Would that story be a big deal like this one?","p032","p002",2.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
1615,150,62,25,"Person 2","Probably not. It's not that big of a story if a male dies doing this. Just the way it is.","p032","p002",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
1616,150,62,26,"Person 1","In China or in general?","p032","p002",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
1617,150,62,27,"Person 2","In general I guess. It's the norm for male soldiers to die but women get the publicity as it is more rare.","p032","p002",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
1618,150,62,28,"Person 1","That's probably true, although I think the way that it happened would get press if it happened in the US. Such a freak occurrance","p032","p002",1.3333,1.3333,2,1
1619,150,62,29,"Person 2","True. Would the male be made out to be a hero though?","p032","p002",1.6667,1,0.6667,1
1620,150,62,30,"Person 1","I would actually say yes, but I bet there would be more press/sympathy if it was a woman","p032","p002",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
1621,150,62,31,"Person 2","Heh. Maybe true equality will come one day. I'm about out of thoughts on this article though!","p032","p002",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
1622,150,62,32,"Person 1","LOL, me too. We've hit 15, so - have a nice day! bye","p032","p002",1,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
1623,150,62,33,"Person 2","bye :)","p032","p002",0.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1624,150,63,0,"Person 1","I'm of two minds about this article. On the one hand, yay first female fighter pilot in China. On the other, she was flying in aerobatic shows. Is that really groundbreaking?","p070","p024",2,1,2.3333,2
1625,150,63,1,"Person 2","Yeah she wasn't doing anything that makes your jaw drop.","p070","p024",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
1626,150,63,2,"Person 1","Do you think she would have ever seen combat? Or at least flown for their military?","p070","p024",1,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
1627,150,63,3,"Person 2","Probably seeing as China would of loved some good publicity in the news.","p070","p024",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
1628,150,63,4,"Person 1","There are three other remaining female pilots I think. I wonder if this will impact their service.","p070","p024",1,1,2.6667,1.3333
1629,150,63,5,"Person 2","Do you think women should be allowed to fly these jets?","p070","p024",1,1.3333,0.6667,1
1630,150,63,6,"Person 1","I believe so. I was just reading about how women were excluded from the space program in the 60s even though they were physically more able to withstand the forces on their bodies","p070","p024",1,1,2.6667,1.6667
1631,150,63,7,"Person 2","I agree with that. Yu's friends say she was a positive, humb,e and nice person who loved taking care of her friends so that just makes it more disappointing.","p070","p024",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
1632,150,63,8,"Person 1","I do wonder what went wrong. I also wonder if the people who think women should be kept out of the military would use this as a way to justify their views.","p070","p024",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
1633,150,63,9,"Person 2","Do you think there might of been something going on there seeins as she was the first female to do it?","p070","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
1634,150,63,10,"Person 1","Now that's an interesting thought. You mean some sort of sabotage?","p070","p024",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
1635,150,63,11,"Person 2","Yeah something like that is what I'm thinking happened.","p070","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
1636,150,63,12,"Person 1","Then my biggest question would be about her male copilot - since he ejected safely, would it be possible he had something to do with it?","p070","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
1637,150,63,13,"Person 2","more than likely it was probably to prove a point to people that females cant do the job by the people that sabotaged the jet.","p070","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
1638,150,63,14,"Person 1","I guess that's a good possibility, especiallly when you think about all fo the people who were saying that this is proof women can't be fighter pilots","p070","p024",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
1639,150,63,15,"Person 2","Regardless if true or not it is an interesting theory","p070","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
1640,150,63,16,"Person 1","It's also very easy to think that if there was sabotage, it's possible it would be used to create a martyr of sorts. Someone that Chinese women could look up to","p070","p024",2,1,2,1
1641,150,63,17,"Person 2","Makes sense since the All-China Womens Federation reported that 60 million users of the Weibo site had clicked on Yu's story.","p070","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
1642,150,63,18,"Person 1","I think I've run out of conversation about this topic and am ready to say goodbye","p070","p024",1,1,0.6667,1.3333
1643,150,63,19,"Person 2","bye","p070","p024",1,0.6667,0.3333,1
1644,150,64,0,"Person 1","So, how do you feel about the coverage of this so-called accident?","p030","p013",0.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1
1645,150,64,1,"Person 2","I think the accident is horrible, could you imagine dying like that?","p030","p013",4.3333,2,4.3333,2
1646,150,64,2,"Person 1","Honestly, no. Being struck by an aircraft after ejecting due to a collision? The level of adrenaline must have been unreal.","p030","p013",4,1.3333,4,1.6667
1647,150,64,3,"Person 2","I will not get on a plane, I couldnt imagine being killed in the air","p030","p013",3.3333,2,3,3
1648,150,64,4,"Person 1","Really? You've never been on an airplane?","p030","p013",2,1.3333,1,1.3333
1649,150,64,5,"Person 2","lol nope, I'll drive anywhere I need to go","p030","p013",2.6667,1.6667,1,2.3333
1650,150,64,6,"Person 1","Right on. I thought the lack of details concerning the cause of the crash was a little suspect.","p030","p013",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
1651,150,64,7,"Person 2","Do you think she was in some way sabotaged?","p030","p013",2,1.3333,0.6667,1
1652,150,64,8,"Person 1","I mean, you can't really say. But, state run media is always a little suspect to me. Plus, the statements supposedly taken from Yu were very sterile and robotic.","p030","p013",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
1653,150,64,9,"Person 2","I like how she was so proud of herself for being the first woman to pilot the fighter jet","p030","p013",3,0,3,2
1654,150,64,10,"Person 1","Yeah, that was very heartening. Also, it didn't mention anything about her family.","p030","p013",3.3333,0.3333,3,1.3333
1655,150,64,11,"Person 2","She got to make her dream come true and she died doing what she loved so that is a plus but I never like to hear about a death","p030","p013",2.6667,1,3,1.6667
1656,150,64,12,"Person 1","I also wonder about the logistics of her death. Was she struck by a third plane not involved in the initial collision? Did the pilot and co-pilot of the other plane eject as well? There's just a lot of details that aren't covered in the article.","p030","p013",3,1,2.6667,2
1657,150,64,13,"Person 2","Yeah I agree there is many unanswered questions","p030","p013",2.3333,1,2,1.3333
1658,150,64,14,"Person 1","And the government seemed unwilling to answer many of those questions. It was probably just a freak accident, but i'm always suspicious of people's motivations.","p030","p013",2.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
1659,150,64,15,"Person 2","yes for sure, do you believe that it is a true story? do you think we could find additional coverage on the story? Do you remember her name?","p030","p013",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
1660,150,64,16,"Person 1","Her name was Yu Xu. There are lots of articles available online concerning the accident and even videos on YouTube. I think that the story id probably true, but I think the cause of the accident is suspect. Maybe flaws in aviation technology that would make Chinese engineers lose face.","p030","p013",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
1661,150,64,17,"Person 2","Ok, I love watching documentaries, I like true television not so much a fan of fiction","p030","p013",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
1662,150,64,18,"Person 1","I also enjoy watching documentaries. Have you seen any good ones lately?","p030","p013",1.3333,0.3333,1,2
1663,150,64,19,"Person 2","I am supposed to be in one about Mturk and the gig economy later on this year and it will be on Netflix...I'm excited","p030","p013",2.6667,0.3333,0.6667,2
1664,150,64,20,"Person 1","No way, really? That's neat. Well, thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p013",2,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
1665,150,64,21,"Person 2","Yes I was contacted by some woman named Shannon Walsh...I didnt believe it at first but I did some research and it is legit...she is a film maker from canada...I talked with her on the phone and they are going to be here in Florida either next month or september. I really enjoyed chatting with you goodbye","p030","p013",2.3333,0.3333,0.6667,2
1666,150,65,0,"Person 1","Hi, what did you think of this?","p029","p022",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
1667,150,65,1,"Person 2","I felt really sad for the woman and her family. What about you?","p029","p022",2.3333,2,4.3333,3
1668,150,65,2,"Person 1","Yes I agree, ,my heart went out to the family, so sad","p029","p022",3,2,3.6667,2.6667
1669,150,65,3,"Person 2","It sucks that she trained all this time to be a pilot jsut to get killed.","p029","p022",3,2,3.6667,3.3333
1670,150,65,4,"Person 1","yeah no doubt, I hope they can figure out what went wrong.  was it the jets or lack of training?","p029","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
1671,150,65,5,"Person 2","Might be just something with the jets, it was just very unfortunate","p029","p022",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
1672,150,65,6,"Person 1","Yes for sure, and I gathered she was very young too?","p029","p022",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
1673,150,65,7,"Person 2","She seemed very young from the article, seemed like she just became a pilot not long ago. Overall, being on a plane is scary, for me at least. Just being in the air in general is scary.","p029","p022",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
1674,150,65,8,"Person 1","Yeah I will not do it at all, terrifying.  So she was very brave.","p029","p022",3.6667,2,2.3333,3.3333
1675,150,65,9,"Person 2","Yeah! I honestly get nervous just flying on an airplane.","p029","p022",3,1.6667,2.3333,3.6667
1676,150,65,10,"Person 1","Yeah I can't do it anymore, I find it to be a nightmare.","p029","p022",3,1.6667,2,3.3333
1677,150,65,11,"Person 2","I was on one time and the plane dropped for like 2 seconds before regaining balance. The pilot apologized but everyone was s cared outta their minds","p029","p022",3,2,2,3.3333
1678,150,65,12,"Person 1","omg.  yeah, no, I refuse.  I used to fly when I Was younger but now I will drive or not go.","p029","p022",3.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3
1679,150,65,13,"Person 2","Yup! Agreed. Hopefully teh family of the woman are all fine now. It must be really hard losing a family member like that.","p029","p022",3.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
1680,150,65,14,"Person 1","Yeah I can't imagine.  I would think they have adjusted but are not fine.  very tragic","p029","p022",3,2,4,2.3333
1681,150,65,15,"Person 2","I can't even imagine training all your life for this and then just having it taken away.","p029","p022",4,2,3.6667,3.3333
1682,150,65,16,"Person 1","yeah and she didn't even know I guess","p029","p022",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
1683,150,65,17,"Person 2","Nope, reminds me of a football player that got into an accident and lost his arm. You never know what's going to happen.","p029","p022",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
1684,150,65,18,"Person 1","Yeah seriously!  I try to avoid dangerous situations but you still never know.  being in a car is dangerous.","p029","p022",2.3333,2,2.3333,3
1685,150,65,19,"Person 2","Yup, gotta live everyday like it's your last! (or at least try to). Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p029","p022",2.3333,1,2,2.6667
1686,150,65,20,"Person 1","so true!  bye!","p029","p022",1.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1687,138,66,0,"Person 1","Hi there - the cruelty of kids towards other kids can be truly horrifying","p032","p024",4,2,3.6667,2.3333
1688,138,66,1,"Person 2","Agree the fact that adults don't educate or do anything more to stop this is even more horrifying.","p032","p024",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
1689,138,66,2,"Person 1","That is the truth! Where are the parents - not just of the kids being bullied, but of othe bullies themselves?f the","p032","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
1690,138,66,3,"Person 2","Parents are just not being parents from the looks of things","p032","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
1691,138,66,4,"Person 1","Sorry about that typo. Why do you think parents don't seem to be willing to be more engaged in their kids' lives? Are the adults too busy, they don't want to intrude, they just want to be buddies with their kids...","p032","p024",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,2.3333
1692,138,66,5,"Person 2","I think life keeps adults too busy to keep the food on the table to be honest...","p032","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
1693,138,66,6,"Person 1","I'm sure that's a big part of it. Maybe parents don't know how to deal with the online/social media world, either","p032","p024",1.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
1694,138,66,7,"Person 2","What do you think the kids that cause the bullying should face?","p032","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,2.6667
1695,138,66,8,"Person 1","That's a great question. There should be some form of punishment but that must include some empathy training. What do you think?","p032","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
1696,138,66,9,"Person 2","I believe that is something they should do train them to do better since kids aren't really ready to think straight yet as I did some things I regret as a kid as well that I would no longer do as an adult.","p032","p024",2,1,2.3333,2.6667
1697,138,66,10,"Person 1","There should probably be school-wide programs to try to prevent all this in the first place. I wonder how clearly this issue is being addressed in US schools?","p032","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
1698,138,66,11,"Person 2","I don't think its being addressed here at all although who knows. The article says in France 90 percent of the kids have access to social media which is where all the bullying goes on. Can you imagine how many kids have access here .","p032","p024",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
1699,138,66,12,"Person 1","It's scary to consider! Must be closer to 100% here.  I'm old enough that there was no social media when I was in school and I'm so freaking grateful for that!","p032","p024",3,1.3333,2,2.3333
1700,138,66,13,"Person 2","Yeah the worst that can happen back then was miniscule to now where hundreds of kids can bully a single child at one time through social media.","p032","p024",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
1701,138,66,14,"Person 1","Exactly. It would be scary as hell to be in school these days. Funny, I always think of this as a US problem, but I shouldn't be surprised that it's a major issue in Europe, too","p032","p024",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
1702,138,66,15,"Person 2","yeah I assume every country with wide internet access has this problem.","p032","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,3
1703,138,66,16,"Person 1","Hooray for technology!","p032","p024",1.3333,0,0.6667,1.6667
1704,138,66,17,"Person 2","What would you do if one of your kids were bullied?","p032","p024",1,1.3333,0.6667,1
1705,138,66,18,"Person 1","You know, I'm not sure. I'm not a parent; beyond being furious, I want to say that I would get in touch with school officials and try to get all the parents involved.  I would give my kid the option to change schools or maybe be homeschooled....? What about you?","p032","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
1706,138,66,19,"Person 2","Same first thing is contact the other kids parents to see if they can talk to the other kid as I would not be able to do that. Second definitely contact the school and if all else fails the police but they would be my last resort. I'm not a parent but that is how I would do it. Changing schools for sure though.","p032","p024",2.3333,1,2.6667,3
1707,138,66,20,"Person 1","That's the thing -  we can get everyone involved, but that won't fix the issue for the bullied person. It's unfair, really","p032","p024",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1708,138,66,21,"Person 2","yeah they won't forget the scar as long as their alive which is terrible and I do not know how that can be fixed","p032","p024",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
1709,138,66,22,"Person 1","Therapy, maybe. Lots and lots of therapy.","p032","p024",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
1710,138,66,23,"Person 2","You're right therapy does work sometimes.","p032","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1711,138,66,24,"Person 1","If you can find a good therapist. But that's a whole other issue :) What is it that makes kids into bullies in the first place?","p032","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
1712,138,66,25,"Person 2","probably their parents at home not giving them enough attention","p032","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
1713,138,66,26,"Person 1","No doubt. Acting out their anger/frustration on other kids instead of their parents. *sigh*","p032","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
1714,138,66,27,"Person 2","dont know if they can be blamed though","p032","p024",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
1715,138,66,28,"Person 1","No, I agree, they're still just kids. Parents need to step up","p032","p024",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
1716,138,66,29,"Person 2","Its just a hard subject overall. I think we did 15 turns too. I enjoyed it. Bye.","p032","p024",2,1,2,2.6667
1717,138,66,30,"Person 1","bye","p032","p024",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1718,138,66,31,"Person 2","bye","p032","p024",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1719,138,67,0,"Person 1","That article really made me emotional...It's so sad when children are bullied and aren't able to fix the situation.","p043","p035",4.6667,2,4.3333,3.3333
1720,138,67,1,"Person 2","Me too. Hopefully some of the things that they are doing will help children.","p043","p035",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,3
1721,138,67,2,"Person 1","Yeah. In the article they said that France was lagging behind Sweden and a couple other countries, I bet America is lagging behind France.","p043","p035",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
1722,138,67,3,"Person 2","I agree, but it is a hard issue to deal with.","p043","p035",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
1723,138,67,4,"Person 1","It's almost an impossible issue to deal with. Every kid has a cell phone and social media. So there's the potential for them to be bullied 24/7.","p043","p035",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
1724,138,67,5,"Person 2","I feel bad for the children and the parents. I have four children and it would break my heart to know they felt like there was no escape.","p043","p035",3.3333,2,4,3.3333
1725,138,67,6,"Person 1","Yeah, especially if you think about what kind of a dark mindset you need to be in to actually want to commit suicide as a child. It's hard to imagine that level of suffering.","p043","p035",4,2,4,2.3333
1726,138,67,7,"Person 2","Your right about social media playing a large role now days.","p043","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
1727,138,67,8,"Person 1","Do you think a little bullying is needed to build a strong enough character to deal with reality as you grow older?","p043","p035",1.6667,1.6667,0.6667,2
1728,138,67,9,"Person 2","I think everybody will deal with something that is part of life.","p043","p035",2,1.6667,2,3.3333
1729,138,67,10,"Person 1","Yeah, so really the only difference between youth of today and past generations being able to deal with being bullied is the internet and social media.","p043","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
1730,138,67,11,"Person 2","They can not escape the bullying","p043","p035",1.6667,2,2,1.6667
1731,138,67,12,"Person 1","Sometimes a good teacher can save children in this situation. They just have to notice it and discipline the other kids early.","p043","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1732,138,67,13,"Person 2","That is true but sometimes a teacher can be part of the problem. I make sure my children know they are loved everyday and home is their safe space.","p043","p035",2,0.6667,2,2.6667
1733,138,67,14,"Person 1","That's truly horrifying if a teacher takes part in the bullying. Good job on making sure your children have a good self esteem.","p043","p035",4,1.6667,2.6667,2
1734,138,67,15,"Person 2","I think any adult seeing a child suffer should step in and help.","p043","p035",3.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
1735,138,67,16,"Person 1","That's true. Other adults are really the only ones who can do something about it. Outside of a parent complaining.","p043","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
1736,138,67,17,"Person 2","Plus teach your children to respect others.","p043","p035",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
1737,138,67,18,"Person 1","Yeah, that's simply good parenting. Also I remember all the shows that I would watch as a little kid always had lessons. They tried to imprint on you to not hurt others or steal or anything else bad. TV shows are probably why I never seriously bullied anyone.","p043","p035",2,0.6667,1.6667,3.3333
1738,138,67,19,"Person 2","TV shows really did have better messaging about those kind of things.","p043","p035",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
1739,138,67,20,"Person 1","Do you think today's tv shows that target youth aren't as educational as in the past? (do you want to keep going or end?)","p043","p035",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.6667
1740,138,67,21,"Person 2","Shows did a better job in the past in my opinion. It was very nice chatting with you!","p043","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
1741,138,67,22,"Person 1","bye","p043","p035",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1742,138,67,23,"Person 2","bye","p043","p035",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1743,138,68,0,"Person 1","Have you ever been bullied?","p030","p006",1,1.3333,2,1.3333
1744,138,68,1,"Person 2","I have in the past. Have you?","p030","p006",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3
1745,138,68,2,"Person 1","Not intensely, that I can remember. There was one older kid on the bus that gave me the business sometimes, but we ended up being friends after a time. How did you respond to being bullied?","p030","p006",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
1746,138,68,3,"Person 2","I can relate to that. I was not severely bullied. It was off and on through elementary and some of middle school. In those moments of being bullied, i would usually ignore it. I was a resilient kid. Are you still friends with that person?","p030","p006",2.3333,1,2.6667,3.6667
1747,138,68,4,"Person 1","Haha, no. That was over 15 years ago. Do you have any ideas on the appropriate response to widespread bullying?","p030","p006",2,1,1.6667,2
1748,138,68,5,"Person 2","I think it depends. I think the bully that happens today is a bit different from the kind many experienced back then. Also, kids that get bullied today, their response to bullying varies.","p030","p006",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
1749,138,68,6,"Person 1","I understand that, but there are a limited amount of ways to respond to verbal and physical abuse. I don't think that the way children respond varies much from when we were children. I think the key difference is that bullying doesn't end just because you're home from school. It can be something that haunts you around the clock day in and day out.","p030","p006",3,1,3.3333,2.6667
1750,138,68,7,"Person 2","Yes, that's what i meant. Bullying does not end even when you're home. What do you think would be an appropriate response to bullying?","p030","p006",2.3333,1,3,2
1751,138,68,8,"Person 1","Unplugging, first and foremost. I don't participate in social media, but I think that it has been an overwhelmingly negative influence on society. The reason that children go to the lengths that this French girl did is because they feel absolutely alone in their suffering. Inclusion is the answer. Something as simple as assigning each child a emotional support classmate could do wonders for kids who are being singled out.","p030","p006",3.3333,0.6667,2.6667,3
1752,138,68,9,"Person 2","That is true. Social media has made a great impact on younger generations. I cannot imagine the impact it would have had on me as a kid. I do agree that inclusion is important and vital. I have never thought of the idea of assigning emotional support classmates. That is an absolutely great idea. Have you seen this used in the real world?","p030","p006",3.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
1753,138,68,10,"Person 1","No, not in any kind of administrative capacity. But, I think that it could potentially be very effective. The modern world has a way of distorting the best of intentions though.","p030","p006",2,0.6667,2.3333,2
1754,138,68,11,"Person 2","How do you mean?","p030","p006",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
1755,138,68,12,"Person 1","Well, an emotional support could potentially become an emotional detriment if a child chose to betray another child's confidence either maliciously or by complete accident.","p030","p006",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
1756,138,68,13,"Person 2","I see. That is a something completely possible. I can see adults playing a better role for emotional support within the classroom. Perhaps having an assigned adult per classroom or something of that sort.","p030","p006",1.3333,0.3333,2.6667,2
1757,138,68,14,"Person 1","Right, when I was in elementary school we had parent volunteers called \"den mothers\" (our school mascot was a lion) who shared their information with children and provided a sympathetic ear. I'd actually be interested to see what a normal day at a public school looks like these days.","p030","p006",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,3
1758,138,68,15,"Person 2","We had something similar in elementary as well. Except, from what i remember, they were teachers assistants. They did the typical TA duties but were there as well to provide emotional support. I am curious too how a normal day is at a public school.","p030","p006",2,0.3333,3,3
1759,138,68,16,"Person 1","I mean, my youngest brother is now home schooled and I know that people who can afford it now send their children to private schools. The devaluation of public education in the US has been profound and embarrassing.","p030","p006",3.6667,0.6667,2,3.6667
1760,138,68,17,"Person 2","I was homeschooled for high school. As a teen i absolutely hated it at first but now that i am older i have come to appreciate it. Public education is definitely not where is should be. I wish the government would make education a focus. It's been busy on other things of course.","p030","p006",3.6667,0.3333,2,3.6667
1761,138,68,18,"Person 1","I went to a boarding school for two years in high school. I also absolutely hated it at the time but looking back I was healthier than I had ever been in my life up to that point. I enjoyed chatting with you! bye","p030","p006",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.6667
1762,138,68,19,"Person 2","Bye. Thanks!","p030","p006",1.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1763,138,68,20,"Person 1","\"bye\" has to be all lowercase","p030","p006",0.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
1764,138,68,21,"Person 2","bye","p030","p006",1,0.6667,0.3333,1
1796,138,70,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p024","p010",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
1797,138,70,1,"Person 2","Bullying is a worldwide problem.   Reading that two young girls felt there was no reason to live was very sad to me.","p024","p010",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
1798,138,70,2,"Person 1","what do you think can be about bullying","p024","p010",2,1,0.6667,1.6667
1799,138,70,3,"Person 2","Social media is a huge component of teen suicides.   Parents are allowing their children to have access to things they are not mentally prepared for at alarming levels.","p024","p010",3,2,2,2.3333
1800,138,70,4,"Person 1","agree parents are at fault in letting them on social media in the first place","p024","p010",3,2,1.3333,1.6667
1801,138,70,5,"Person 2","Exactly.   Many studies have already been done that kids shouldn't be on social media.   Their frontal cortex is not prepared for all they experience.  Once you see it, you can't unsee it.","p024","p010",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
1802,138,70,6,"Person 1","especially kids their brains arent fully developed yet and anything negative can have a big effect on them just reading it online","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
1803,138,70,7,"Person 2","It certainly can.  You always here the old \"I need to contact them.  They may need me.\"   Well youngsters aren't by themselves.  They always have an adult.   Call the school office if you need something or vice versa.   It worked that way for 2010 years.","p024","p010",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
1804,138,70,8,"Person 1","did you ever experience bullying as a child?","p024","p010",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1
1805,138,70,9,"Person 2","I did.  My family lived on a farm.  The city kids always made fun of the country kids.   How parents allow their kids to be so mean - I will never understand.   Many parents need parenting classes before they have kids.   It's like I see nothing, I hear nothing mentality.   Such a disservice.   Were you bullied?","p024","p010",3.3333,2,1.6667,3.6667
1806,138,70,10,"Person 1","I was bullied as well but I had older brothers who would prevent it for the most part fortunately I didn't get it as bad as other kids including my friends. It happens in every school, every city, every country.","p024","p010",3,2,2.3333,4
1807,138,70,11,"Person 2","It's alarming to the level it has gotten.   It weighs on your soul.   Middle school and high school are the worst in my opinion.","p024","p010",4,2,2.6667,3
1808,138,70,12,"Person 1","yep middle school is the worst kids dont think straight at that age","p024","p010",3,2,2,2.3333
1809,138,70,13,"Person 2","Too many hormones kicking in.    Did bullying affect your opinion of yourself?","p024","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1,2
1810,138,70,14,"Person 1","yeah I would not want to go to school sometimes what about you?","p024","p010",2,1.6667,1,3
1811,138,70,15,"Person 2","Same here.   I have had lifetime effects from a self-esteem point.   The old bullying adage of you are stupid, you are ugly, etc.  has lasting effects","p024","p010",3,2,2,2.6667
1812,138,70,16,"Person 1","do those childhood memories still haunt you today?","p024","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
1813,138,70,17,"Person 2","They do.   What about you?","p024","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
1814,138,70,18,"Person 1","Yeah sometimes I wish I could go back and stand up for myself","p024","p010",3.6667,1.6667,2,3.3333
1815,138,70,19,"Person 2","We didn't have the tools to do so younger.  Do overs are always better results.  It's been very nice chatting with you.    goodbye","p024","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
1816,138,70,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p010",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1817,3,71,0,"Person 1","Tell me how you feel about this event?","p005","p037",1.6667,1,0.6667,1
1818,3,71,1,"Person 2","It's really saddening","p005","p037",3.6667,2,4,1.6667
1819,3,71,2,"Person 1","I feel so terrified","p005","p037",4.3333,2,3.6667,2
1820,3,71,3,"Person 2","Me too","p005","p037",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
1821,3,71,4,"Person 1","I feel so sad for the family","p005","p037",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
1822,3,71,5,"Person 2","I can't even imagine the trauma that their families will go through","p005","p037",4.3333,2,4.3333,1.6667
1823,3,71,6,"Person 1","It was really too much","p005","p037",3.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
1824,3,71,7,"Person 2","I wonder what must have caused the malfunction of the ride","p005","p037",2,1.3333,1,1.3333
1825,3,71,8,"Person 1","I think some investigations should be done","p005","p037",2.3333,1,1,2
1826,3,71,9,"Person 2","Apparently","p005","p037",1.3333,1,1,1
1827,3,71,10,"Person 1","This should be prevented from happening again","p005","p037",2.3333,0.3333,1,1.6667
1828,3,71,11,"Person 2","And I think the company should pay some sort of compensation","p005","p037",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2
1829,3,71,12,"Person 1","Yes i will agree with that","p005","p037",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
1830,3,71,13,"Person 2","In saner climes, such companies would be sued and shut down eventually","p005","p037",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
1831,3,71,14,"Person 1","I think that will not be a bad idea","p005","p037",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
1832,3,71,15,"Person 2","What do you think should be done to prevent future occurrence of such accident","p005","p037",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
1833,3,71,16,"Person 1","it was really a malfunction. it would be hard to proffer a solution now unless we know exactly the cause of the malfunction.","p005","p037",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
1834,3,71,17,"Person 2","Alright, but can you make a guess?","p005","p037",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
1835,3,71,18,"Person 1","I think a good proper check will definitely help","p005","p037",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
1836,3,71,19,"Person 2","It will. Thanks for your time.","p005","p037",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
1837,3,71,20,"Person 1","goodbye","p005","p037",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1838,3,71,21,"Person 2","bye","p005","p037",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1839,3,72,0,"Person 1","Isn't this heartbreaking? It makes me never want to go on another ride at an amusement park.","p038","p043",3,2,4,3
1840,3,72,1,"Person 2","Yeah...Whenever I'm on a huge roller coaster or something, I always have the thought that I just could fly out and die. And I guess that's where some of the excitement comes from. For these lives to be ruined on that ride though, it's terrible.","p038","p043",3,2,3,3
1841,3,72,2,"Person 1","It is terrible. It doesn't even sound like its a thrill ride. It sounds like its just one of those water rides that you kinda float along and get wet but no massive drops or turns. I wouldn't have thought about getting hurt on a ride like that.","p038","p043",2,2,3,3
1842,3,72,3,"Person 2","I agree. The boat or whatever they were on capsizing is basically the only way you could get hurt. This story makes me angry too, how could a ride with so many problems pass inspection 3 days earlier?","p038","p043",3,2,3,3
1843,3,72,4,"Person 1","I don't know that makes me angry too. Because of someones incompetence people are devastated by the loss of someone close to them.","p038","p043",3,2,4,4
1844,3,72,5,"Person 2","Yup. Also that ride was problem plagued pretty much the entire day. If they're having that much trouble with a relatively simple ride, how about you shut it down for the day??","p038","p043",2,2,3,3
1845,3,72,6,"Person 1","No kidding. Its not like there wasn't other rides to go on. just shut it down. Since its in Australia I wonder if they have to follow the same guidelines the theme parks here in the US have to follow? I'm pretty sure there's restrictions and guidelines. Or maybe thats just wishful thinking. lol","p038","p043",3,2,3,3
1846,3,72,7,"Person 2","I think 3rd world countries are the only ones with less restrictions than America lol. At least they shut the park down but I think we would do that too.","p038","p043",3,1,3,3
1847,3,72,8,"Person 1","I don't know lol I'm not really familar with any theme parks other then Disney and I think they're kinda a class unto themselves. lol I'm not one for roller coasters and after reading this I'm not sure I want to go on any water rides now lol","p038","p043",2,1,2,2
1848,3,72,9,"Person 2","I think that's a little bit of an irrational thought. It happens to everyone though. Just because a plane crashes doesn't mean you should drive 30 hours to your destination instead. Roller coasters are a little bit different but on those water rides, you probably have a .0000000001% chance of dying. And I haven't been to an amusement park in a while. I go to fairs sometimes though and I doubt they have much restrictions regarding ride safety.","p038","p043",2,2,4,2
1849,3,72,10,"Person 1","True. We have our local fair going on right now and I took my daughter on the giant slide and going up the stairs that thing was so rickety I really don't think it was put together right. lol","p038","p043",4,2,3,3
1850,3,72,11,"Person 2","You probably feel worse after reading this story lol. And the problem with these small fairs is they probably can't afford the safety checks and engineers to properly maintain the ride.","p038","p043",3,2,3,3
1851,3,72,12,"Person 1","No they probably can't which is too bad because they're such a fun thing to do once a year that doesn't require traveling far","p038","p043",2,2,2,3
1852,3,72,13,"Person 2","Yeah and the food is usually incredible too. I love fairs!! Do you think the park will be liable for this accident? Or maybe you waive your rights when you purchase tickets?","p038","p043",2,1,2,2
1853,3,72,14,"Person 1","I bet they are liable. I don't think that you would waive your rights unless you explicitly sign a waiver. But who knows maybe they make everyone sign a waiver.","p038","p043",4,2,3,2
1854,3,72,15,"Person 2","If they are liable, they're in trouble. I'm not sure how much money it would require to replace having a mother for your life. And that's just the one person, I think four people died in this situation.","p038","p043",2,2,2,3
1855,3,72,16,"Person 1","Yeah 4 and I'm sure they will all sue for whatever they can. I think they can not only sue the park but probably whoever the person is that allowed the ride to continue to stay open after failing the safety checks","p038","p043",2,2,2,2
1872,3,73,0,"Person 1","This is so sad and should not have happened these rides should be tested more.","p024","p035",4,2,4.3333,2.3333
1873,3,73,1,"Person 2","I agree, it was greed by the park.","p024","p035",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
1874,3,73,2,"Person 1","Do you think the park should face any consequences","p024","p035",1.3333,1.3333,3,1
1875,3,73,3,"Person 2","Yes, that is the only way they will change. What do you think?","p024","p035",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
1876,3,73,4,"Person 1","I definitely think there should be a hefty fine.","p024","p035",3,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1877,3,73,5,"Person 2","I feel bad for the girl who lost her mother.","p024","p035",4.3333,2,4.6667,2.6667
1878,3,73,6,"Person 1","The fact some of them were in holiday makes it depressing to hear.","p024","p035",4,2,3.3333,2.6667
1879,3,73,7,"Person 2","Yeah, You go to have fun and come home with somebody in your family dead.","p024","p035",4,1.6667,4,2
1880,3,73,8,"Person 1","Yeah, leaving the stress of work and then dying on vacation is crazy.","p024","p035",3.6667,2,4.3333,2
1881,3,73,9,"Person 2","I'm happy that the two girls made it out alive.","p024","p035",4,0,4.3333,2.6667
1882,3,73,10,"Person 1","Yeah the girl that watched her mother die is going to need a lot of therapy I hope she gets it.","p024","p035",4.3333,1.3333,4,3
1883,3,73,11,"Person 2","I agree, that one day changed her life forever.","p024","p035",4,1.6667,4.6667,1.6667
1884,3,73,12,"Person 1","Visitors said the ride had been plagued with mechanical glitches earlier that day the fact they kept it running shows who they are.","p024","p035",3,1.6667,3,2
1885,3,73,13,"Person 2","Yeah they just wanted to make more money.","p024","p035",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
1886,3,73,14,"Person 1","Money really is the root of all evil.","p024","p035",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333

1890,3,73,18,"Person 1","Yeah it can not at all this is just terrible. I think thats fifteen turns. Bye.","p024","p035",2,1.6667,4,2.3333
1891,3,73,19,"Person 2","bye","p024","p035",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1892,3,73,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p035",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
1893,3,74,0,"Person 1","Hello. What happened to those people is really pathetic","p037","p055",3.6667,2,4,1
1894,3,74,1,"Person 2","Hello. It's beyond terrible. I can't even imagine going through something like that. I mean you're out to make lasting memories and instead lose your whole family. Terrible.","p037","p055",4.3333,2,4,2.3333
1895,3,74,2,"Person 1","Indeed. I can only imagine the trauma the survivors will go through","p037","p055",3,2,3.3333,2
1896,3,74,3,"Person 2","I know. I've grown up going to fairs every summer and been to Disneyland and other amusment parks and you just never imagine that things like that can happen.","p037","p055",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
1897,3,74,4,"Person 1","I really don't like such places though because I fear things like that may happen","p037","p055",3,2,2,2.6667
1898,3,74,5,"Person 2","It's funny because you hear now and then that something like this can happen. Yet whenever I'd go. It would never even cross my mind. I guess it's funny how we don't like to imagine that kind of terrible incident happening to us directly.","p037","p055",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1899,3,74,6,"Person 1","I understand. But nothing is impossible though","p037","p055",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
1900,3,74,7,"Person 2","Oh, I know nothing is impossible. I just don't guess we like to imagine that they happen to us.","p037","p055",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
1901,3,74,8,"Person 1","That's true. By the way, I think the company should be sued","p037","p055",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
1902,3,74,9,"Person 2","I'm sure they will be. I fear that is another problem with our society. We take every bad thing and want to see it as a way to make money. Not saying the company shouldn't be held accountable for their actions. But I wish we weren't always looking to make a buck off bad things and accidents.","p037","p055",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
1903,3,74,10,"Person 1","As it stands, what happened probably was as a result of negligence. Accidents like these don't happen in Disneyland","p037","p055",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
1904,3,74,11,"Person 2","I agree. Shoddy maintenance or failure to fix something due to expenses I'm sure probably was involved since there were many statements that the ride was having problems most of the day. I just think it's so sad that those people have to try and move forward after losing their loved ones in such a horrible way.","p037","p055",3,2,3,1.3333
1905,3,74,12,"Person 1","Indeed","p037","p055",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
1906,3,74,13,"Person 2","I also think its sad that so many people memories are ruined over this. I can't imagine all my happy summer fair memories and trips to amusement parks being tainted by something like this.","p037","p055",3,2,3,2
1907,3,74,14,"Person 1","It's really saddening. I wouldn't want to be in such situation","p037","p055",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
1908,3,74,15,"Person 2","Me either. I also wonder why if the ride was having so many issues they didn't just shut it down. I'm not familiar with that park as I'm in the US but surely that wasn't the only ride. Why not just close it and then make sure its fixed for another day?","p037","p055",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
1909,3,74,16,"Person 1","Greed! That's why. It was nice chatting with  you. Do you have a nice day","p037","p055",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
1910,3,74,17,"Person 2","I'm sure greed did in fact have a part in it. I'd like to know more though. It's so easy to get caught up in the terrible accident part of the story and forget there are other sides to an issue.","p037","p055",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
1911,3,74,18,"Person 1","bye","p037","p055",1,1,1,1
1912,3,74,19,"Person 2","Thanks for the chat. I enjoyed talking with you. bye","p037","p055",2,0.6667,0.3333,1.3333
1913,3,75,0,"Person 1","Wow, what did you think of this?!","p029","p035",2.6667,1,1,1
1914,3,75,1,"Person 2","Very sad and very scary, what do you think?","p029","p035",4.3333,2,4,2.6667
1915,3,75,2,"Person 1","YEs!  So heartbreaking and how traumatizing for everynoe involved","p029","p035",4.6667,2,4,2.3333
1916,3,75,3,"Person 2","That what I was thinking. Something that was suppose to be fun.","p029","p035",3.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2
1917,3,75,4,"Person 1","Yes, seriously.  Gosh and how painful for the adults who suffered, and omg the kids.  Even for the witnesses it would have been terrifying.","p029","p035",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
1918,3,75,5,"Person 2","It makes me think twice about going to places like that.","p029","p035",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
1919,3,75,6,"Person 1","I do not go to places like that bc I am a paranoid person and this is exactly what I fear.  Just this week a roller coaster plunged off the track and two people died","p029","p035",4,2,2,3.3333
1920,3,75,7,"Person 2","We are on the same page with that","p029","p035",2.6667,1,2,2.3333
1921,3,75,8,"Person 1","it's just not worth it to me.  but regardless, it should be safe for these people who do choose to do it","p029","p035",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
1922,3,75,9,"Person 2","I agree. My i don't let my kids get on local fair rides.","p029","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2,3.3333
1923,3,75,10,"Person 1","no, i do not either, definitely not.","p029","p035",3,1.3333,1.6667,3
1924,3,75,11,"Person 2","I know people die everyday but not all deaths are equal.","p029","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
1925,3,75,12,"Person 1","yeah seriously, I mean my philosophy is if it can be prevented I'd like to take those measures.  I know some people have a different approach and that is fine but this is how I choose to live my life.","p029","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3
1926,3,75,13,"Person 2","You only get one for forever.","p029","p035",2.6667,0.3333,2,2
1927,3,75,14,"Person 1","yep, exactly.  maybe they should have better regulation of these theme park rides or somethiing, I don't know.","p029","p035",2,1,2,2
1928,3,75,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I agree with that","p029","p035",1.3333,0.3333,2,1.3333
1929,3,75,16,"Person 1","Like some sort of weekly checks.  It should not be a deadly situation.","p029","p035",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
1930,3,75,17,"Person 2","I think they do daily checks, but I think a death in your park should have big penalties","p029","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
1931,3,75,18,"Person 1","You are probably right, I know nothing about it.  but yeah, that's a good point.  huge fines.  I must be going, it was nice talking to you.  bye","p029","p035",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
1932,3,75,19,"Person 2","You too! bye","p029","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
1933,169,76,0,"Person 1","I really am not sure how I feel about this article. I think that parents in this situation need to face some type of punishment.","p002","p030",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
1934,169,76,1,"Person 2","Why do you feel that way?","p002","p030",0.6667,1,1.3333,1
1935,169,76,2,"Person 1","Because it is a case of negligence at the core.","p002","p030",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
1936,169,76,3,"Person 2","Because they left a window open and the toddler pushed through the screen? I know that jumping toward negligence is a common emotional reaction to situations like this, but I think that you're misplacing blame in this instance.","p002","p030",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
1937,169,76,4,"Person 1","Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out.","p002","p030",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
1938,169,76,5,"Person 2","In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen.","p002","p030",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
1939,169,76,6,"Person 1","If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes.","p002","p030",3.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
1940,169,76,7,"Person 2","Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered. It's terrible to think of a dead child in any context.","p002","p030",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
1941,169,76,8,"Person 1","Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents.","p002","p030",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
1942,169,76,9,"Person 2","I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing.","p002","p030",2,1,2.6667,2.6667
1943,169,76,10,"Person 1","Right so the \"punishment\" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again.","p002","p030",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
1944,169,76,11,"Person 2","I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity. Tragedies like this are required before any meaningful action is taken across the board.","p002","p030",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
1945,169,76,12,"Person 1","It is sad for sure. I hope I do not seem too uncaring about this scenario it just triggers anger rather than sympathy as this is something that could have been avoided though I can imagine the parents feel the guilt more than anybody else.","p002","p030",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,3
1946,169,76,13,"Person 2","anger is a completely natural response to situations like this I was just picturing the parents sitting in the living room confident in the fact that their children were safe while one lay dead in the parking lot below","p002","p030",4,1.3333,3,2
1947,169,76,14,"Person 1","Yea I can imagine that was a tough thing to experience. Sucks that their other little kid will never meet his brother.","p002","p030",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
1948,169,76,15,"Person 2","Yeah, so sympathy was my first response. Do you have children?","p002","p030",2.3333,1,2,2
1949,169,76,16,"Person 1","I do not have children but do have nieces and nephews. I am able to feel sympathy, anger and be critical at the same time though. Sympathy doesn't change the facts.","p002","p030",2.6667,1,2.6667,3
1950,169,76,17,"Person 2","Well, considering we don't have all the facts I think that's a pretty foolish statement.","p002","p030",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
1951,169,76,18,"Person 1","Fact 1- the window was left open with only a screen. Fact 2- the screen was not secured in place. Fact 3- The parents could not heard from the living room to the kids room. Those seem to be easily understood facts.","p002","p030",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
1952,169,76,19,"Person 2","Your second and third facts are assumptions. The screen could have been secure, but the full weight of a four year old child being pressed against it over an extended period of time could certainly dislodge it. The whole process could have been relatively silent as those details weren't included in the article, hence my statement about having all the facts. It seems your anger is causing you to attempt to establish things as fact that simply can't be substantiated. Thanks for chatting! bye","p002","p030",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
1953,169,76,20,"Person 1","have a good one! bye","p002","p030",1.6667,0.6667,0,1
1954,169,77,0,"Person 1","Tell me what you feel about the incident?","p005","p013",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
1955,169,77,1,"Person 2","I think that is horrible can you imagine what the parents are going through after this","p005","p013",3.6667,2,4.6667,3
1956,169,77,2,"Person 1","I feel really sad about it","p005","p013",3,2,4.3333,2.6667
1957,169,77,3,"Person 2","Yes it is terrible, it made me think about some of the windows in my house","p005","p013",2.6667,2,4,3
1958,169,77,4,"Person 1","Yes, especially when you still have young ones at home","p005","p013",1.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
1959,169,77,5,"Person 2","I have a couple windows up stairs that I need to look at, I dont think my son can reach them but you kids can be very creative when they want something","p005","p013",2.3333,1.3333,3,3
1960,169,77,6,"Person 1","Yes, it is really as if the first years of their lives they are always looking for ways to kill themselves","p005","p013",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
1961,169,77,7,"Person 2","That poor baby was probably in so much pain before dying","p005","p013",4,2,4.6667,3
1962,169,77,8,"Person 1","I can only imagine that really","p005","p013",3,1,3,2
1963,169,77,9,"Person 2","It probably happens more than we hear about it","p005","p013",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
1964,169,77,10,"Person 1","Yes, I think parents need to be more active and keep an eye on these young ones","p005","p013",2,1.3333,2,2
1965,169,77,11,"Person 2","Certainly do, it is best to prevent accidents from happening ahead of time by identifying threats","p005","p013",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
1966,169,77,12,"Person 1","Yes. what else do you think can be done to prevent this?","p005","p013",0.6667,1,2.6667,1
1967,169,77,13,"Person 2","I think that parents should make sure that all windows are locked securely","p005","p013",0.6667,0.3333,3,2.3333
1968,169,77,14,"Person 1","And even if they are not they should always keep an eye on their kids","p005","p013",2,0.3333,2.3333,2.6667
1969,169,77,15,"Person 2","Yes deffinately, I'm sure the parent is pretty upset with themself right now","p005","p013",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
1970,169,77,16,"Person 1","I really feel so sad for the parents","p005","p013",3,2,4,3
1971,169,77,17,"Person 2","They sell cheap window locks that can put on any window on Amazon","p005","p013",0.6667,1,3.3333,1
1972,169,77,18,"Person 1","sure that will be a good thing to do","p005","p013",1,0.6667,2.6667,2
1973,169,77,19,"Person 2","I'm pretty sure they can be applied to any window, I recently bought some to go on the cabinets in the kitchen","p005","p013",0.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
1974,169,77,20,"Person 1","I also think this safety measures should be advocated","p005","p013",1,0.3333,2.6667,2
1975,169,77,21,"Person 2","It really does make you question what they parents where doing when this happened","p005","p013",2,1.6667,3,2
1976,169,77,22,"Person 1","i wonder as well","p005","p013",1.6667,1,2.6667,1
1977,169,77,23,"Person 2","I know children can be sneaky but I would imagine you can hear your kid trying to climb out of a window","p005","p013",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
1978,169,77,24,"Person 1","I am always curious whenever they are silent","p005","p013",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
1979,169,77,25,"Person 2","Exactly, so some of the blame deffinately is on the parent","p005","p013",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
1980,169,77,26,"Person 1","Yes a larger part of it i must say","p005","p013",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
1981,169,77,27,"Person 2","How should a problem like that be addressed? Should it be on the news to notify all parents of the dangers?","p005","p013",1,1,1.6667,1.6667
1982,169,77,28,"Person 1","I think the media should do more to create more awareness","p005","p013",1,0.3333,2.3333,2
1983,169,77,29,"Person 2","Yes that's what I was saying but I doubt parents would watch a boring show about kids falling from windows","p005","p013",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
1984,169,77,30,"Person 1","oh yeah... I think we have had a great conversation....goodbye","p005","p013",2,0.3333,0.3333,1
1985,169,77,31,"Person 2","Yes I enjoyed speaking with you goodbye","p005","p013",2,0,0.3333,1.6667
1986,169,78,0,"Person 1","hello, what did you think about the article?","p009","p070",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
1987,169,78,1,"Person 2","Hi, I thought the article was dreadfully sad. I can't imagine being those parents.","p009","p070",3.6667,2,4.3333,3
1988,169,78,2,"Person 1","me either, they must feel awful","p009","p070",3.3333,2,3.6667,3
1989,169,78,3,"Person 2","I do wonder though why limits on how far you can open a window in a high rise isn't a thing. The one time I lived in a high rise you couldn't open the windows more than a few inches.","p009","p070",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
1990,169,78,4,"Person 1","yeah true i thought the same. or they will have bars to prevent it","p009","p070",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
1991,169,78,5,"Person 2","Do you know of any child proofing things for windows? The only think I could think of would prevent the windows from being opened","p009","p070",0.6667,1,2,1.6667
1992,169,78,6,"Person 1","they will usually have steel bars or something like that in high rises","p009","p070",0.6667,1,2,2
1993,169,78,7,"Person 2","True. I wonder if the parents will eventually feel moved to try and get bars installed. It sounds like the kind of situation where it could easily happen again","p009","p070",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
1994,169,78,8,"Person 1","yeah i think i remember reading that they had another child","p009","p070",0.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
1995,169,78,9,"Person 2","I mean, it seems like it might be a potential legal issue - or osha or something. Then again, I'm also remembering the recent cruise where a baby/kid fell several stories out of a window","p009","p070",1,2,2,2
1996,169,78,10,"Person 1","yea true. the parents really should have been more careful, i feel awful for them though","p009","p070",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
1997,169,78,11,"Person 2","Me too. I know some people hate safety laws, but it seems like this one area should be a safety thing. I mean, for the owners of high rises to take reasonable precautions against people going out windows. If you think about it, it could also apply to an adult!","p009","p070",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
1998,169,78,12,"Person 1","yes that is true. i hope they have learned from it","p009","p070",2,1.6667,3,2
1999,169,78,13,"Person 2","That's really what I meant about legal issue before - I mean, not for the parents but for the owners.","p009","p070",1,1.3333,1.3333,2
2000,169,78,14,"Person 1","i agree with that","p009","p070",1,1,0.6667,1.6667
2001,169,78,15,"Person 2","I am grateful though that the parents aren't being looked at with suspicion. It seems all too often that there might be something else going on.","p009","p070",2,1.3333,3.3333,2
2002,169,78,16,"Person 1","yeah true im sure that would only add to their misery","p009","p070",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
2003,169,78,17,"Person 2","If it was me, I'm not sure I'd be abe to live above ground level ever again","p009","p070",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
2004,169,78,18,"Person 1","im going to end the chat now, it was nice talking to you, have a good day. goodbye","p009","p070",1.3333,1,0.3333,1.3333
2005,169,78,19,"Person 2","goodbye","p009","p070",0.3333,1,0.3333,1
2006,169,79,0,"Person 1","I feel bad about the little boy","p035","p037",2.6667,2,3.6667,3
2007,169,79,1,"Person 2","It's horrible what happened to him","p035","p037",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
2008,169,79,2,"Person 1","How do you feel about the parents?","p035","p037",1,1,2,1
2009,169,79,3,"Person 2","In as much as what happened was an accident according to the police investigations, I think the parents should be blamed","p035","p037",3,2,2,2
2010,169,79,4,"Person 1","I think they should be blamed, but losing a child is a lot of punishment.","p035","p037",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
2011,169,79,5,"Person 2","Indeed","p035","p037",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
2012,169,79,6,"Person 1","I worry too and always watch my children.","p035","p037",3,2,2,3.3333
2013,169,79,7,"Person 2","You should. I can't take my eyes off them","p035","p037",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3
2014,169,79,8,"Person 1","I wonder what they were thinking?","p035","p037",1,1.3333,3,2.3333
2015,169,79,9,"Person 2","His mother holds most of the blame in this case","p035","p037",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
2016,169,79,10,"Person 1","why do you think that?","p035","p037",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.6667
2017,169,79,11,"Person 2","She was the one that put them to bed. She was supposed to check all windows properly before leaving the room","p035","p037",2,2,1.6667,2.6667
2018,169,79,12,"Person 1","I agree a little, but the father was at home and odds are this is not the first time the window was open.","p035","p037",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2019,169,79,13,"Person 2","Either ways, what happened was really terrible. I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that","p035","p037",3.3333,2,3.6667,3.3333
2020,169,79,14,"Person 1","me either, I hope others learn from this.","p035","p037",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2021,169,79,15,"Person 2","I hope so too. What would you advise parents that live in storey buildings?","p035","p037",2,1,2.3333,2.6667
2022,169,79,16,"Person 1","most newer windows had child locks so the window only opens so much, older windows you should put a stick or stopper in them.","p035","p037",1,1,2,2.3333
2023,169,79,17,"Person 2","Nice. I think that can curb future occurrence of such incident. It was nice chatting with you","p035","p037",2,0,1.3333,2
2024,169,79,18,"Person 1","you too, bye","p035","p037",1.3333,1,0.3333,1
2025,169,79,19,"Person 2","bye","p035","p037",1,1,0.3333,1
2026,169,80,0,"Person 1","hey what are your thoughts on the article","p068","p010",1,1,0.3333,1
2027,169,80,1,"Person 2","It was so very sad.   Those poor parents.","p068","p010",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
2028,169,80,2,"Person 1","I now what a sad painful way to die","p068","p010",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
2029,169,80,3,"Person 2","I doubt he felt anything.  Most of the time it is just quick.   Leaving a window opened for fresh air definitely was not intentional","p068","p010",3,1.6667,3,2
2030,169,80,4,"Person 1","thats true idk if that was me i would have monitored it more","p068","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
2031,169,80,5,"Person 2","It's always easy to see what should have been done.  Parents work, cook, clean, take care of kids, etc.   Possibly they could have seen whether it was easy to push out though.   Kids are climbers.  Mine certainly never stayed in their crib.","p068","p010",2.3333,1,2.6667,3.3333
2032,169,80,6,"Person 1","wish the apartment had some kind of reinforcement on the windows for safety","p068","p010",2,1.6667,2,2
2033,169,80,7,"Person 2","Definitely.  As long as they have renters, they may clean the carpet and that's about it.","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.3333
2034,169,80,8,"Person 1","that is so sad they should make laws","p068","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
2035,169,80,9,"Person 2","I know.  I felt for the people that were outside and found him.","p068","p010",3,2,4,2.3333
2036,169,80,10,"Person 1","i know i would be traumatized for life","p068","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
2037,169,80,11,"Person 2","Exactly.  If I run up on a wreck with fatalities, it's devastating","p068","p010",4,2,3.3333,3
2038,169,80,12,"Person 1","i dont know how emergency responders do it","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
2039,169,80,13,"Person 2","Agreed and what surgeons see.  God bless them all","p068","p010",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2040,169,80,14,"Person 1","yes thats why they get paid so much","p068","p010",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
2041,169,80,15,"Person 2","and they should.   I do feel like the apartment owner is at fault though.  It won't bring the little boy back but it may help others","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
2042,169,80,16,"Person 1","yeah to put more safety and education in play for others i agree","p068","p010",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
2043,169,80,17,"Person 2","Exactly.   I have never seen a little one die.  (:","p068","p010",2.6667,2,2,3
2044,169,80,18,"Person 1","I would never want to how sad","p068","p010",3.3333,2,3,3.3333
2045,169,80,19,"Person 2","agreed.  well it was nice chatting with you.   Have a good day goodbye","p068","p010",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
2046,169,80,20,"Person 1","you two bye!","p068","p010",2,0.6667,0.3333,1
2047,353,81,0,"Person 1","I felt like the article was a bit worriesome. What abotu you?","p022","p029",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
2048,353,81,1,"Person 2","Worrisome how so?  I found it to be very tragic.  I keep thinking about the remaining family members like what if there was a wife/mother and possible siblings who lost a brother and a dad?","p022","p029",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
2049,353,81,2,"Person 1","I guess that's what i meant too. It worries me to think about what the remaininig family members have to go through.","p022","p029",3,2,4,2.3333
2050,353,81,3,"Person 2","Yes exactly, same here.  It's seriously terrible.  And was certainly so unexpected too","p022","p029",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
2051,353,81,4,"Person 1","I know someone who went through the same thing, their family was never the same. It's very sad.","p022","p029",4.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
2052,353,81,5,"Person 2","Yes that's certainly something you could never come back from.  My cousin lost her husband to a kayaking accident last year.  Just to lose two family members at once is just extra terrible.","p022","p029",3.3333,2,4.3333,3.6667
2053,353,81,6,"Person 1","Wow, i feel bad for them. To lose someone you love unexpectedly, i can't even imagine.","p022","p029",4,2,4.6667,2.6667
2054,353,81,7,"Person 2","Yeah seriously.  I don't even like talking about it.","p022","p029",3.3333,2,4.6667,2
2055,353,81,8,"Person 1","How long do you think it'll take for the family members to recover? or at least, not feel as much pain as they're feeling now","p022","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
2056,353,81,9,"Person 2","Yes good question.  I guess that would vary per person.  Some people may never recover, you know?  Certainly it would take at least six months or a year to begin to feel like you could function each day again.  I really don't know what do you think?","p022","p029",2,1.3333,4,2
2057,353,81,10,"Person 1","I think it'll take at least half a year before the feeling of shock leaves. But like you said, they'll prob never recover. Or at least never be the same.","p022","p029",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
2058,353,81,11,"Person 2","Yeah definitely it would be life altering/life ruining possibly to have something like that happen","p022","p029",3,2,3.6667,3
2059,353,81,12,"Person 1","That's why i always preach live life to it's fullest and show love to everyone. You never know what will happen.","p022","p029",2.6667,1,3,3
2060,353,81,13,"Person 2","Yes that is a good thing to live by every day because you just never know.  I also prefer to avoid risky activities but that's just me.","p022","p029",2.6667,1.3333,3,3
2061,353,81,14,"Person 1","Same here. I don't do things like skiing or snowboarding even though all my friends love that.","p022","p029",2.3333,1,3,3
2062,353,81,15,"Person 2","Yes I don't do those things either.  To me it's just not worth the possible risk and I'd rather my family members not do those things either.  Right now I can prevent my kids from doing dangerous things but I guess when they're older it will be out of my control.","p022","p029",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
2063,353,81,16,"Person 1","Definitely. I  undertand how my parents feel now when i was younger and did reckless things.","p022","p029",2.3333,1.6667,3.6667,3.3333
2064,353,81,17,"Person 2","ME too!  I put mine through torture for sure.  Ugh.","p022","p029",3,1.6667,2,2.3333
2065,353,81,18,"Person 1","Well, it was nice talking to you. I hope that family recovers. :(","p022","p029",2.6667,1,1,2
2066,353,81,19,"Person 2","You too, and I hope the same.  Have a great day","p022","p029",2.3333,0.3333,1,2
2067,353,81,20,"Person 1","bye","p022","p029",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
2068,353,81,21,"Person 2","bye","p022","p029",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
2069,353,82,0,"Person 1","I wish there was more details...How/Why did they fall off a cliff??","p043","p041",2,1.6667,1,1.3333
2070,353,82,1,"Person 2","I was thinking the same thing. Maybe the weather was a factor","p043","p041",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
2071,353,82,2,"Person 1","Maybe a really powerful snow storm so they didn't have visibility?","p043","p041",0.6667,1.3333,2,1
2072,353,82,3,"Person 2","Well it was in California, so I am not so sure about that","p043","p041",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
2073,353,82,4,"Person 1","There's snow on mountains there tho! Good place to ski/snowboard.","p043","p041",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
2074,353,82,5,"Person 2","I was also wondering if there was any foul play","p043","p041",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
2075,353,82,6,"Person 1","I really doubt that. How exactly would that happen? Like in a cartoon, someone switched a sign or something so they walked straight off a cliff??","p043","p041",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
2076,353,82,7,"Person 2","There could have been someone that has not yet been discovered who was involved somehow","p043","p041",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
2077,353,82,8,"Person 1","Do you think they might've been pushed? My first thought was the son might've slipped or something and the father was unable to pull him up. So they both fell.","p043","p041",2,1.6667,1.3333,1
2078,353,82,9,"Person 2","I would not rule it out. It just seems too strange to me that two perfectly sensible people just fell off a cliff","p043","p041",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
2079,353,82,10,"Person 1","Yeah, I didn't realize the full scope of what you meant by foul play. They could've been robbed/killed and then just tossed off a cliff.","p043","p041",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
2080,353,82,11,"Person 2","We are just speculating. I wish there were more details. I was also curious about what failure the helicopter experienced","p043","p041",2,1.6667,1.6667,1
2081,353,82,12,"Person 1","Yeah, that seemed really unlucky. The father/son must've survived the cliff fall though. Otherwise why was the helicopter issue relevant?","p043","p041",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
2082,353,82,13,"Person 2","It seemed like negligence to me. I don't think the helicopter was well maintained","p043","p041",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
2083,353,82,14,"Person 1","I don't know if I'd go that far. Just bad luck...Airplanes are really well maintained and they still have all sorts of problems that result in delays.","p043","p041",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
2084,353,82,15,"Person 2","OK. Also what kind of safety measures were implemented near the cliff? Did the trail lead directly to it?","p043","p041",1,1,1.3333,1
2085,353,82,16,"Person 1","I'd hope the trail didn't lead to it. Maybe they weren't on a trail and were just hiking? It'd be nice if the local government put fencing or something around where they fell, so this doesn't happen again. Also it's strange that the article didn't talk about the part of their family that survived this tragedy and are grieving now.","p043","p041",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
2086,353,82,17,"Person 2","I would agree about the fencing. Yes I wonder how the mother is coping and/or any siblings.","p043","p041",1.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
2087,353,82,18,"Person 1","I wonder if they're thinking that if they also went on this trip, they could've prevented this...Just an all around sad situation.","p043","p041",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
2088,353,82,19,"Person 2","They might be thinking about suing the county or state.","p043","p041",1.3333,1.6667,3,1
2089,353,82,20,"Person 1","Maybe. Especially if the father/son were still alive and potentially could've been treated at a hospital if not for the helicopter issues. Or maybe the local government could be blamed for not maintaining the trail they were on (do you want to continue or end)?","p043","p041",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
2090,353,82,21,"Person 2","Both are equally valid in my opinion. I was also wondering if any other people have fallen off that particular cliff","p043","p041",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
2091,353,82,22,"Person 1","Yeah, it would've been nice to see some statistics regarding falls/fatalities in the area but once again, the article failed us...","p043","p041",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
2092,353,82,23,"Person 2","Also how steep was the cliff? How far did they fall?","p043","p041",1.3333,1.6667,0.6667,1
2093,353,82,24,"Person 1","We can assume that it was steep enough to do some serious damage. How do you think people were alerted to this accident?","p043","p041",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
2094,353,82,25,"Person 2","That is a great question. That's one of the reasons I suspect foul play. The last person with victim(s) is usually the first suspect","p043","p041",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
2095,353,82,26,"Person 1","And there had to be someone who called it in, unless the father or son were in good enough condition to dial 911.","p043","p041",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1
2096,353,82,27,"Person 2","It could have been another hiker. The call would have to have been made shortly after the fall since the rescue helicopter was dispatched","p043","p041",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
2097,353,82,28,"Person 1","Yeah, I wonder if this was a popular hiking destination? Also I wonder what kind of evidence there would be if foul play occurred? Maybe branches broken in weird ways that show a struggle occurred?","p043","p041",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
2098,353,82,29,"Person 2","There should be plenty of evidence. I doubt they went off that cliff willingly","p043","p041",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
2099,353,82,30,"Person 1","bye","p043","p041",1,1,0.3333,1
2100,353,82,31,"Person 2","goodbye","p043","p041",1,1,0.3333,1
2101,353,83,0,"Person 1","It's a shame that a father-son outing had to end so tragically.","p030","p005",3,2,4,2.6667
2102,353,83,1,"Person 2","That was really a sad event","p030","p005",3,2,4,2.6667
2103,353,83,2,"Person 1","Did they actually die on impact, or was the helicopter malfunctioning the reason why they didn't make it out?","p030","p005",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
2104,353,83,3,"Person 2","I think it was because of the helicopter power failure","p030","p005",1,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
2105,353,83,4,"Person 1","They must not have fallen very far if they survived the initial impact. Did the article even explain how they ended up falling from the trail?","p030","p005",1,1,2.3333,2.3333
2106,353,83,5,"Person 2","No, Not sure","p030","p005",0.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
2107,353,83,6,"Person 1","It's really hard to feel overly empathetic in this instance because of the lack of details.","p030","p005",1.3333,1,2,3
2108,353,83,7,"Person 2","Details or No details. That's sad thing to happen to anyone","p030","p005",2.6667,2,4,2.6667
2109,353,83,8,"Person 1","I'm not denying the tragedy of the circumstances, but the world at large has become inured to delineations of events like this.","p030","p005",1.3333,1,1.6667,3.3333
2110,353,83,9,"Person 2","Sadly, that is true","p030","p005",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.6667
2111,353,83,10,"Person 1","I mean, here in the states we have a mass shooting every week or so; there are never many details, but tell me that headlines like \"12 dead, 8 wounded in mass shooting\" don't roll off your back after the last few years.","p030","p005",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
2112,353,83,11,"Person 2","You are on point. Details matters as well","p030","p005",0.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
2113,353,83,12,"Person 1","Details are what curry empathy among the listener, even something as trivial as mentioning that the child's parents had just divorced or that he had a mother at all would have made the story more relateable.","p030","p005",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
2114,353,83,13,"Person 2","That is true, But we should not deviate from the fact that, that was a tragic incident.","p030","p005",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
2115,353,83,14,"Person 1","I don't think it's a deviation to suggest how they might have added pathos to the story.","p030","p005",1,1,2,2.3333
2116,353,83,15,"Person 2","What do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence?","p030","p005",0.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.6667
2117,353,83,16,"Person 1","That's a tough one. National Parks are large and people take a risk every time they go into the woods. I suppose proactive education is probably the most feasible answer.","p030","p005",0.6667,1,2,2.3333
2118,353,83,17,"Person 2","I will agree with that","p030","p005",0.6667,1,1.6667,2
2119,353,83,18,"Person 1","Well, thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p005",1,0,0.6667,1.3333
2120,353,83,19,"Person 2","bye","p030","p005",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
2121,353,84,0,"Person 1","Hey there, I think it's pretty messed up that those people died from a result of the chopper being borked.","p007","p024",4,2,3,3
2122,353,84,1,"Person 2","Yeah and the fact that the helicopter had a power failure when trying to get to them is disappointing.","p007","p024",4,2,3,3
2123,353,84,2,"Person 1","You would think that they would have some sort of backup plan or maybe a spare chopper though.","p007","p024",3,2,2,2
2124,353,84,3,"Person 2","Yeah doesn't really make me feel like they can be relied on","p007","p024",3,2,3,3
2125,353,84,4,"Person 1","I wonder if they are underequipped to handle situations. Maybe they don't get enough funding.","p007","p024",2,2,3,2
2126,353,84,5,"Person 2","Maybe they dont have the funding youre right","p007","p024",2,1,2,2
2127,353,84,6,"Person 1","I mean if so that is pretty messed up; especially in Cali. People get hurt hiking and rock climbing all the time there so you'd think they'd beef up the rescue response.","p007","p024",3,2,3,2
2128,353,84,7,"Person 2","They definitely need to be more prepared","p007","p024",3,1,3,3
2129,353,84,8,"Person 1","If I recall the response to the recent wildfire was kinda eh as well. Search and Rescue wise I mean. The firefighters worked their butts off.","p007","p024",3,0,3,3
2130,353,84,9,"Person 2","They can learn a thing or two from firefighters","p007","p024",2,0,3,2
2131,353,84,10,"Person 1","Real talk. Those people go at their job hardcore. Although seeing as Cali has wildfires literally every year they are probably better funded as well.","p007","p024",3,0,2,3
2132,353,84,11,"Person 2","Search and Rescue just aint that known like firefighters are","p007","p024",1,2,2,2
2133,353,84,12,"Person 1","True. Their role is equally as important though. Too many ill prepared people do risky things and end up in trouble.","p007","p024",2,2,3,3
2134,353,84,13,"Person 2","I remember hearing Trump wanted to cut federal aid to Cali which is probably why the rescue team is so bad.","p007","p024",2,2,3,3
2135,353,84,14,"Person 1","Wait really? What the hell? That's kinda messed up. Even if they oppose him pollitically like, their people too dude.","p007","p024",3,2,2,3
2136,353,84,15,"Person 2","Yeah, politics is crazy","p007","p024",2,1,1,2
2137,353,84,16,"Person 1","Yea for sure.. I guess he's gotta funnel all that money into the wall though right?","p007","p024",2,2,2,2
2138,353,84,17,"Person 2","Who knows what he'll do he's out of it. I think we did 15 turns though lol.","p007","p024",3,1,2,1
2139,353,84,18,"Person 1","It's gotta be 10 each.","p007","p024",2,1,1,1
2140,353,84,19,"Person 2","All in all, search and rescue teams need to have a huge upgrade","p007","p024",2,1,2,3
2141,353,84,20,"Person 1","Yea for sure. Any service does when people's lives are on the line.","p007","p024",3,1,2,3
2142,353,84,21,"Person 2","Yeah they are equally as important as everyday cops.","p007","p024",2,1,2,2
2143,353,84,22,"Person 1","Man cops get too much flak. Yes some of them are corrupt and some are trigger happy, but the majority are legit there to do their job.","p007","p024",4,2,4,3
2144,353,84,23,"Person 2","Cops are more good than bad","p007","p024",4,0,4,3
2145,353,84,24,"Person 1","Yea. Around my area they are really good. I think only one in the past 6ish years has been thrown off the force for doing something dumb.","p007","p024",4,0,3,3
2146,353,84,25,"Person 2","they give out toys to kids at the local parks around LA all the time","p007","p024",2,0,3,3
2147,353,84,26,"Person 1","They do that here too around christmas. Although I have a feeling they are underfunded as well. They still drive beat up partol cars from the 90's","p007","p024",2,2,2,3
2148,353,84,27,"Person 2","yeah all that money is spent on the military probably which is not even that needed","p007","p024",3,2,3,3
2149,353,84,28,"Person 1","Amen to that. But of course we gotta be the world police right? Ugh.","p007","p024",3,1,3,3
2150,353,84,29,"Person 2","world police that never does a succesful intervention which makes it worse","p007","p024",3,2,3,3
2151,353,84,30,"Person 1","Yea it's all just a waste of lives, money, resources, etc.","p007","p024",2,2,1,3
2152,353,84,31,"Person 2","aren't we still in Afghanistan? lol","p007","p024",1,1,1,2
2153,353,84,32,"Person 1","We are in Afganistan, Iraq, Iran (unofficially, but I know people based there,) basically like every country in the middle east at this point.","p007","p024",2,1,2,3
2154,353,84,33,"Person 2","don't forget we have bases in Germany, Japan, etc for no reason. If Russia did that we'd be calling them evil.","p007","p024",2,1,2,2
2155,353,84,34,"Person 1","Oh man yea truth for sure. I bet that new space force is gonna get proper funding though amirite? Man we are in such a pit as a country right now.","p007","p024",3,2,2,2
2156,353,84,35,"Person 2","yeah its quite depressing to see some people without health care and then see new fighter jets being built","p007","p024",3,2,3,3
2157,353,84,36,"Person 1","Yea I know how that feels personally. It's bull. Our monetary allocation is all over the place.","p007","p024",4,2,2,3
2158,353,84,37,"Person 2","1st world country btw","p007","p024",1,1,1,2
2159,353,84,38,"Person 1","Yea totally. Hell my mom can't even afford her medication to function every day. It is ridiculous.","p007","p024",3,2,2,3
2160,353,84,39,"Person 2","yeah its not very fair how they allocate everything","p007","p024",3,2,2,3
2161,353,84,40,"Person 1","Maybe one day things will get better. One can hope.","p007","p024",3,0,2,2
2162,353,84,41,"Person 2","One can only pray","p007","p024",2,0,1,2
2163,353,84,42,"Person 1","Anyway rantom Turker it's been a great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday! :) goodbye","p007","p024",2,0,2,1
2164,353,84,43,"Person 2","bye","p007","p024",0,1,0,1
2165,353,85,0,"Person 1","The article was very sad. What did you think abotu it?","p022","p062",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
2166,353,85,1,"Person 2","I thought it was sad, too.  There weren't many details though.  I wonder what happened for both of them to die.","p022","p062",2,2,3.3333,2.3333
2167,353,85,2,"Person 1","Did they find the bodies yet? I thought i read that they are still looking. Either way, i'm pretty sure both passed away.","p022","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2168,353,85,3,"Person 2","I think they know where the bodies are but can't retrieve them.  That was my interpretation.  That seems sort of lonely, even though they're dead.","p022","p062",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
2169,353,85,4,"Person 1","I wonder what the mom is going through. It's terrible.","p022","p062",3.3333,2,4.3333,1.6667
2170,353,85,5,"Person 2","Yes, I'm sure she's incredibly distraught.  I also wondered, was it better or worse that the father and son died together?","p022","p062",2.3333,2,4.6667,2.3333
2171,353,85,6,"Person 1","i think it's pretty bad. Or at least for the father. I'm sure he would have wanted his son to live and grow up to watch his mom","p022","p062",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
2172,353,85,7,"Person 2","I'm sure.  I also wonder whether one of them did something that caused problems for them both.  Like, one slipped and then they both fell when the other tried to save the first.  That would be awful.","p022","p062",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
2173,353,85,8,"Person 1","Yeah you're right. There weren't much details about what happened. Though, i do hope they find their bones(assuming they passed away)","p022","p062",2,1.6667,3,2
2174,353,85,9,"Person 2","As sad as it is, hiking is dangerous.  Mother Nature can be brutal.  You always take risk when you go out like that.","p022","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
2175,353,85,10,"Person 1","Yeah, i try to stay away from things like hiking. lol","p022","p062",1.6667,1,2.6667,3
2176,353,85,11,"Person 2","This story reminded me of my dog.  She tumbled over a cliff of sorts, fell into a river bed, and was never seen again.  Made me very sad.","p022","p062",4.3333,2,3.3333,3.6667
2177,353,85,12,"Person 1","I'm so sorry to hear that. That's why i always preach live life to the fullest and show love to your loved ones","p022","p062",3,1.3333,3,2
2178,353,85,13,"Person 2","Yes, that's a good philosophy.  We don't show enough love and appreciation to those we care about.","p022","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
2179,353,85,14,"Person 1","Also living life to the fullest, never know what will happen.","p022","p062",3,1,2.6667,2.6667
2180,353,85,15,"Person 2","This is sort of why I wonder whether it was better or worse emotionally for them to be together.  Either they appreciated the companionship and comfort of having the other person there, or it was worse because they knew neither would get out, and perhaps one even caused the death of the other.","p022","p062",3,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
2181,353,85,16,"Person 1","That's true. Either way, it's scary to think about. What do you think happened though? Do you think they're both dead?","p022","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
2182,353,85,17,"Person 2","Yes, I think they're both dead.  I think they fell off a cliff or something.  Or there was a rock slide or something.  That'd be my guess, although I really don't know.","p022","p062",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2183,353,85,18,"Person 1","A rockslide sounds about right. Are they sure they fell? What if they got eaten by an animal.","p022","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3,2
2184,353,85,19,"Person 2","I thought it said they fell, although maybe I'm misremembering, or assumed that incorrectly.  But yeah, it could be a lot of things.  Getting lost, animals.  I suppose they could have even gotten sick eating something, although they were just hiking so they probably wouldn't need to eat anything they found.","p022","p062",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
2185,353,85,20,"Person 1","Let's just hope something positive comes out of this although i doubt it. Well it was nice talking to you!","p022","p062",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
2186,353,85,21,"Person 2","Yeah, that would be a minor miracle.  Anyway, nice talking to you, too.","p022","p062",2,0.3333,2,2.3333
2187,353,85,22,"Person 1","bye","p022","p062",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
2188,353,85,23,"Person 2","bye","p022","p062",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
2189,304,86,0,"Person 1","I've actually experienced this phenomenon second hand and it's just heart breaking.","p030","p043",4.3333,2,4,2.6667
2190,304,86,1,"Person 2","Wow, that's terrible. How old was the child?","p030","p043",4,2,4,1.3333
2191,304,86,2,"Person 1","He was only 12. Apparently, he hung himself after being punished by his father for misbehaving.","p030","p043",4,2,4,2.6667
2192,304,86,3,"Person 2","That's so sad. Do you know if the punishment was a one time thing or if the child was often disciplined?","p030","p043",3,2,4.3333,1.3333
2193,304,86,4,"Person 1","I don't know the details; and i'm not one to make assumptions, but it rang true when the article mentioned that these types of suicide are often impulsive decisions made rashly in emotional circumstances.","p030","p043",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
2194,304,86,5,"Person 2","Yeah and with the internet, it's really easy for a kid to google to find out a suicide method.","p030","p043",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
2195,304,86,6,"Person 1","I think it serves as more than just a resource for methods at this point. Children are exposed to so much on the internet these days it is difficult for me to fathom.","p030","p043",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
2196,304,86,7,"Person 2","Yup, kids grow up sooooooo much faster than in previous generations because of our media.","p030","p043",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
2197,304,86,8,"Person 1","Not to mention round the clock exposure to bullies, creeps and the sorry state of the world at large.","p030","p043",3.6667,2,4.3333,1.6667
2198,304,86,9,"Person 2","I don't think the world is in that much of a sorry state. This is probably the best time to ever be alive. It's just news is constantly doom and gloom. Bullying is probably one of the biggest reasons for children suicide.","p030","p043",2.6667,1,3.6667,2.6667
2199,304,86,10,"Person 1","The world can be painted in very different lights depending on where you are getting your information. The lens through which your world is perceived is much more easily manipulated when you are a child. Do you have any ideas about how to curb online harassment?","p030","p043",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
2200,304,86,11,"Person 2","The only solution I think can think of is to monitor your child's internet use. That is way overbearing though. Maybe in the future, AI could be trained to monitor these kinds of problems.","p030","p043",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2201,304,86,12,"Person 1","I suppose it's a possibility, but AI is still its infancy. I think the article had a point when it mentioned that listening to your child and actually having a functional and supportive relationship with them is the greatest deterrent. So many children get home from school and just plug into the television or their telephone.","p030","p043",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
2202,304,86,13,"Person 2","Yeah but it really takes patience and persistence. I remember not really wanting to talk to my parents about school related things even though I had a good relationship with them. Somehow ensuring that your children have a good friend network would also be important. They shouldn't ever feel alone in the problems their having.","p030","p043",2.3333,0.3333,3.3333,3
2203,304,86,14,"Person 1","Patience and persistence should be requirements for anyone to become a parent. You can definitely be a refuge for your children without being overbearing.","p030","p043",2.6667,0.3333,4,2.3333
2204,304,86,15,"Person 2","That's true but you need to suffer through many monotonous conversations. \"How was school?\" \"Good.\" Times that by 1,000 until the kid needs advice about something.","p030","p043",2.6667,1.3333,3,2
2205,304,86,16,"Person 1","I'm not a parent, so it's quite easy for me to armchair quarterback, but I think a little nuance will go a long way. \"How's so and so? Did you see * today?\" Is your english teacher still a jerk? Etc.\"","p030","p043",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2206,304,86,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm just seeing through the kid perspective and the kinds of conversations I had with my parents. I just wanted them to be over so I could talk about what I wanted to talk about. Something needs to be done though, as car accident fatalities and homicides went down but suicides went up...","p030","p043",3,0.6667,3.6667,3
2207,304,86,18,"Person 1","I agree. I think that mental health resources for pre-teens could also have a positive affect on this issue. Well, Thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p043",1.6667,0,3,2.3333
2208,304,86,19,"Person 2","Yeah and perhaps there could be a technology solution. Hold on a sec, need 10 turns!","p030","p043",0.6667,0,2,1.6667
2209,304,86,20,"Person 1","Yep, that was your tenth one! bye","p030","p043",0.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1

2255,304,88,0,"Person 1","It's very depressing to know that suicide deaths among kids is on the rise.","p024","p029",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
2256,304,88,1,"Person 2","I find that very depressing and sad too.  What do you attribute it to?  The article didn't touch much on the causes.","p024","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
2257,304,88,2,"Person 1","I'm thinking bullying by other kids that can be tough on kids that have never experienced it before.","p024","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
2258,304,88,3,"Person 2","Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking too.  I read a lot in the news about children who have committed suicide as a result of bullying, it's really heartbreaking.  IT seems so frequent.","p024","p029",3.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
2259,304,88,4,"Person 1","and with social media it only gets worse","p024","p029",2,2,2,1.6667
2260,304,88,5,"Person 2","yes social media is the major fuel to that fire in my opinion","p024","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2261,304,88,6,"Person 1","yeah what was once one kid bullying another is now hundreds or even thousands joining in on it.","p024","p029",3,1.6667,3,1.3333
2262,304,88,7,"Person 2","yes and it follows them home, they can't escape it.  It's really sad.  We don't allow social media in our house, not for anyone.  It's not safe in my opinion.","p024","p029",3,2,2.6667,3.3333
2263,304,88,8,"Person 1","yeah its a good thing you can block them all out with a good router","p024","p029",2,0.6667,2,2
2264,304,88,9,"Person 2","yes that's true, my kids don't try to sneak and use it so that's not an issue at this point but it's good that's an option.","p024","p029",2,0.6667,1.6667,3
2265,304,88,10,"Person 1","yeah even if you dont think theyd visit them its always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion","p024","p029",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
2266,304,88,11,"Person 2","yes mine will not, they think they are evil, but yes being safe rather than sorry is always a good thing","p024","p029",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,3
2267,304,88,12,"Person 1","do you think some blame can be placed on the parents of kids that commit suicide?","p024","p029",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
2268,304,88,13,"Person 2","that's kinda hard to say.  I mean, I guess one could argue that the parents could have failed to do things to protect their children in some cases.  I can't imagine if my child were being bullied and just failing to act.  And parents that allow their children to be exposed to things they shouldn't be.  I really don't know, though.  You'd have to judge that on a case by case basis I think.  What do you think?","p024","p029",2.6667,1,3,3
2269,304,88,14,"Person 1","I agree it depends on the case.","p024","p029",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
2270,304,88,15,"Person 2","yes I mean you couldn't just say that as a blanket statement.  But if a parent disregarded signs of distress then they would seem partially responsible.","p024","p029",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2271,304,88,16,"Person 1","a lot of parents unfortunately do disregard the signs","p024","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
2272,304,88,17,"Person 2","yeah that's terrible and seems like neglect","p024","p029",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
2273,304,88,18,"Person 1","its a crime in my opinion","p024","p029",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
2274,304,88,19,"Person 2","yes, maybe eventually the legal system will see it that way too","p024","p029",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
2275,304,88,20,"Person 1","its the logical thing to do considering what the kids go through","p024","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
2276,304,88,21,"Person 2","Yes I agree it makes sense and a parent has a duty to protect.  Well I must unfortunately go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you have a nice day.  goodbye","p024","p029",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667

2278,304,89,0,"Person 1","It is quite alarming that suicides among young children have increased, but not at all surprising","p041","p022",3,2,2.6667,2
2279,304,89,1,"Person 2","It is very sad. I have some young cousins so it gets me worried.","p041","p022",3.3333,2,3.3333,3.3333
2280,304,89,2,"Person 1","Why do you worry about your cousins? What makes you think they may be at risk for suicide?","p041","p022",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
2281,304,89,3,"Person 2","I would say because they are very introverted. Spend lots of time indoors and don't like socializing with others.","p041","p022",2,1.3333,2.3333,4
2282,304,89,4,"Person 1","That can be troubling. Do you think their behavior is out of the ordinary for children their age?","p041","p022",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
2283,304,89,5,"Person 2","I would think it's because of bullying at school to be honest. I think that's what causes most suicides","p041","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3.3333
2284,304,89,6,"Person 1","That can be a factor. I believe there is a direct correlation between social media and suicide in general","p041","p022",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.6667
2285,304,89,7,"Person 2","I honestly think so as well. I think social media forces children and teens to think they have to be a certain way.","p041","p022",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,3
2286,304,89,8,"Person 1","I agree. Increased social media use is correlated with many negatives, depression is one of them. Depression and suicide are also linked","p041","p022",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2287,304,89,9,"Person 2","Definitely. As well as anxiety if it gets too serious i would say.","p041","p022",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
2288,304,89,10,"Person 1","The date listed in the article is very telling. The suicide rates began to increase in 2007. This is around the time that social media prevalence increases as well","p041","p022",1.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333
2289,304,89,11,"Person 2","You got that right. I wonder if there will ever be some type of ban or limit on social media in the future.","p041","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
2290,304,89,12,"Person 1","I am not sure. But something has to be done to address the negative impact that social media has on society","p041","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
2291,304,89,13,"Person 2","Do you know anyone that has been through this situation or osmething similar?","p041","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
2292,304,89,14,"Person 1","No I do not know anyone who has committed suicide? Do you?","p041","p022",1,1,0.6667,1.6667
2293,304,89,15,"Person 2","No but i do have a friend that is always depressed and that can lead to something else in the future","p041","p022",2,1.6667,1.6667,3
2294,304,89,16,"Person 1","Is your friend active on social media websites?","p041","p022",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
2295,304,89,17,"Person 2","Active like browsing other people. Not posting or anything though","p041","p022",1,1,0.6667,2
2296,304,89,18,"Person 1","Using the sites for browsing qualifies as activity. I think social media websites should be required to provide online counseling for their users. I think this would help ameliorate some of the problems","p041","p022",2,1.3333,2,3.6667
2297,304,89,19,"Person 2","Thats a great idea, definitely would help. Well it was nice talking to you!","p041","p022",2.6667,0,2,1.6667
2298,304,89,20,"Person 1","It was nice talking with you too. Do you have any ideas on how to improve the impact of social media on suicides?","p041","p022",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333
2299,304,89,21,"Person 2","I would say a limit on social media like Instagarm. maybe it can close after a certain amount of minutes. It will prob never happen though, but just an idea.","p041","p022",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
2300,304,89,22,"Person 1","Thats a good idea! Maybe if there were someway to monitor the emotional state of the user and limit the activity based on that. What do you think?","p041","p022",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
2301,304,89,23,"Person 2","Sounds good. Hope things will improve in the future. bye!","p041","p022",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333

2303,304,90,0,"Person 1","The suicide numbers are disconcerting, but I'm amazed at the improvement in the car accident death numbers.","p062","p050",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2304,304,90,1,"Person 2","Same here, it is really sad","p062","p050",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
2305,304,90,2,"Person 1","I thought it was interesting that the suicide spike was in 2007, when I think the iPhone was introduced.  Not saying there's a direct causation there, but I don't think pervasive internet and social media has been good for children's (or anyone's) mental health.","p062","p050",2,1.6667,2.6667,3.3333
2306,304,90,3,"Person 2","Yea, with internet, we tend to compare our self with others. Personally, I see comparison as a form of motivation though, some people however get pressurized with it.","p062","p050",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2307,304,90,4,"Person 1","Yes, I think you're exactly right about the comparison part.  We're exposed to so many images to compare ourselves to.  Exponentially more than we used to be.  That weighs heavily on many.","p062","p050",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2308,304,90,5,"Person 2","also, I feel this generation is weaker..lol","p062","p050",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
2309,304,90,6,"Person 1","I think so, too, although I think that's partly a function of the environment they're growing up in.","p062","p050",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
2310,304,90,7,"Person 2","Yeah...more attention should be paid to emotional intelligence and maturity.","p062","p050",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
2311,304,90,8,"Person 1","I have to admit that I laughed at the article when the expert said that it's not normal to say things like, \"I wish I could just go to sleep forever.\"  I've been saying that every day for 30 years.","p062","p050",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667
2312,304,90,9,"Person 2","Lol..I say that a lot too. That is what stress can cause","p062","p050",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
2313,304,90,10,"Person 1","What I didn't relate to was when she said a teen might kill themselves because of a fight with their boyfriend.  I never remember having feelings nearly that volatile.","p062","p050",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.6667
2314,304,90,11,"Person 2","It is sad..it all boils down to emotional intelligence. Many of these kids going into relationship aint matured enough","p062","p050",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
2315,304,90,12,"Person 1","I think they also live so much of their lives, and relationships, online.  And there's something more powerful about that, as counterintuitive as it sounds.  it's like it exists inside you, so it's not diluted by anything, instead of existing in reality, outside of you.","p062","p050",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
2316,304,90,13,"Person 2","You have a solid point there. They dont get to discover the person who they really are...","p062","p050",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
2317,304,90,14,"Person 1","I can't fathom what it must be like for a parent to lose a child through suicide.  Not only the obvious loss, but the incredible guilt that they must feel, rightly or wrongly.","p062","p050",3.3333,2,4.6667,3
2318,304,90,15,"Person 2","Yea..it is selfishness on the kid's part","p062","p050",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
2319,304,90,16,"Person 1","Sure, although we're all guilty of that to various degrees.","p062","p050",2,1.3333,2,2
2320,304,90,17,"Person 2","I wont like to be in that shoe...I really hope not to be","p062","p050",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
2321,304,90,18,"Person 1","Yeah, that's probably got to be about as bad as it gets.","p062","p050",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
2322,304,90,19,"Person 2","Depression is also a major culprit...I heard it is more mental than emotional","p062","p050",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
2323,304,90,20,"Person 1","Yes, depression is definitely a large factor.  Too bad because it's something that's not treated simply.  Although we certainly try to throw a lot of drugs at this type of thing now.","p062","p050",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2324,304,90,21,"Person 2","The drugs...I dont feel they really solve it. It is just to manage it. The pharmaceutical companies are all out for more profits","p062","p050",2.6667,1.6667,2,3.3333
2325,304,90,22,"Person 1","Yes, I think it's not a great situation.  Anyway, it was good talking to you.  I'm going to sign off here.  bye","p062","p050",2,1,1.6667,2

2330,233,91,3,"Person 2","It is really sad that this is happening in the society","p030","p005",3,2,2.6667,2.6667
2331,233,91,4,"Person 1","I think this is more an example of what happens when there is no social fabric to support people who are easily exploited.","p030","p005",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,3
2332,233,91,5,"Person 2","I agree with you","p030","p005",1.3333,0.3333,1,1.3333
2333,233,91,6,"Person 1","Do you think that anything can be done to prevent such things in situations like this? Or, is it just a sorrowful truth about human nature?","p030","p005",2.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
2334,233,91,7,"Person 2","I think Governments are doing all they can and the military. But i doubt if there will ever be permanent solution","p030","p005",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
2335,233,91,8,"Person 1","I think the military is part of the problem in this instance. These are people who have been displaced to refugee camps by violence.","p030","p005",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
2336,233,91,9,"Person 2","True, i think adequate punishment should be given","p030","p005",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333

2338,233,91,11,"Person 2","This is really sad to hear","p030","p005",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.6667
2339,233,91,12,"Person 1","It's really difficult for me to imagine. Humans are resilient creatures, but the kinds of things that are being allowed to happen at this stage of social progress makes me realize just how lost we are as a species.","p030","p005",3.3333,2,3.3333,3.3333

2341,233,91,14,"Person 1","There are things that can be done, but the likelihood is slim. I think that the United Nations should take up a banner for all refugees. There are people being displaced all over the world and the world is consistently shrugging its shoulders when confronted with that reality. I think they should at least be contributing to relief and temporary placement efforts in affected areas. More people should be volunteering to help.","p030","p005",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,3
2342,233,91,15,"Person 2","I totally agree with you","p030","p005",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
2343,233,91,16,"Person 1","The problem is that humans only have so much empathy to give and this sort of situation seems to roll from one crisis to another with no end in sight.","p030","p005",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
2344,233,91,17,"Person 2","I really hope it will not have really long term bad effect on the victim","p030","p005",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333

2348,233,92,1,"Person 2","It was honestly disgusting. The women managed to survive one atrocity and now are being mistreated by the same people who \"saved\" them.","p022","p043",4.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
2349,233,92,2,"Person 1","I agree. Just thinking about the women who got impregnated by these terrible soldiers makes me sad.","p022","p043",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
2350,233,92,3,"Person 2","Yup. And those women must've trusted those soldiers too, out of desperation. And 2.5 million people were displaced!! Such a terrible situation.","p022","p043",4,2,3.3333,2.3333
2351,233,92,4,"Person 1","I wonder how those children grew up. It's a terrible situation for the moms as well as the children that were born","p022","p043",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
2352,233,92,5,"Person 2","They probably grew up knowing nothing except constant battle and death. Just trying to survive another day...","p022","p043",3.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
2353,233,92,6,"Person 1","Just imagine what the fathers are going through.... man.","p022","p043",4,2,3.3333,1.3333
2354,233,92,7,"Person 2","Their fathers were probably dead or fighting against Boko Haram. It's such a sad situation.","p022","p043",3.6667,2,3.6667,1.6667

2356,233,92,9,"Person 2","Isn't this basically modern times in Africa? This is still a big issue. Boko Haram still exists.","p022","p043",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
2357,233,92,10,"Person 1","I guess i meant to say here in America. I wonder if there's anything people can do to help this situation","p022","p043",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
2358,233,92,11,"Person 2","I think part of their group is aligned with ISIS and to my knowledge, ISIS is barely alive after losing so much territory.","p022","p043",2,1.3333,3,1
2359,233,92,12,"Person 1","Great. These crazy groups need to all disappear lol","p022","p043",4,1,2,2
2360,233,92,13,"Person 2","Yeah but it takes a lot of killing to make them disappear. It's a good thing Trump was so motivated to finally end their terror.","p022","p043",3.3333,1,2.6667,2.6667
2361,233,92,14,"Person 1","Agreed. I think majority are wiped out though. Let's hope for a better future.","p022","p043",2.6667,0.3333,2.6667,1.6667
2362,233,92,15,"Person 2","Yeah. Also we need to strengthen some areas in the middle east so they aren't as easily destroyed if a new ISIS like group is formed.","p022","p043",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
2363,233,92,16,"Person 1","Do you think USA should meddle in foreign affairs though?","p022","p043",1,1,1,1
2364,233,92,17,"Person 2","That's a tough question. It could be argued that ISIS even existed in the first place because of the power vacuum we left in Afghanistan and Iraq when we supplanted their governments. I honestly think we should quit being the world police for a while until most problems in America are solved. So much money was spent in the middle east in the past 20 years.","p022","p043",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
2365,233,92,18,"Person 1","I can agree with that. We definitely have issues here that are more important. Well it was nice talking to you!","p022","p043",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
2366,233,92,19,"Person 2","Yeah, we have plenty of issues here!! Nice talking to you as well, bye.","p022","p043",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
2367,233,92,20,"Person 1","bye","p022","p043",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
2368,233,93,0,"Person 1","The sad part is that its Nigeria and there will be no justice for these raped women.","p024","p007",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
2369,233,93,1,"Person 2","Yea that is really really messed up. The people committing these crimes should pay for them. Sexual abuse is no joke at all and I hate that those women have to go through it with no hope..","p024","p007",4,2,3.3333,2
2370,233,93,2,"Person 1","Yeah I read they were raped by camp leaders which makes it worse","p024","p007",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
2371,233,93,3,"Person 2","It really does. Rape in general is just one of those unforgivable things and it sickens me that people are barbaric enough to commit it.","p024","p007",4.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
2372,233,93,4,"Person 1","Yeah as a man, I couldn't live with myself knowing I raped a woman.","p024","p007",3.3333,2,3,3
2373,233,93,5,"Person 2","Likewise, and I've been sexually abused before so I somewhat know what they are going through; not the hopelessness but the pain..","p024","p007",4,2,3.3333,3.6667
2374,233,93,6,"Person 1","Thats terrible sorry to hear about that. I have people in my family who have also been abused and it is just depressing to think about.","p024","p007",4,2,3,3.6667
2375,233,93,7,"Person 2","Yea people are really messed up. Luckily i got the help I needed but those poor women have to endure it.. I don't like that our country is the \"wold police\" but those rapists deserve a bullet real talk.","p024","p007",4,2,3.6667,3.3333
2376,233,93,8,"Person 1","Yeah these girls live in a country with no justice or rape resources.","p024","p007",2,2,3.6667,2.3333
2377,233,93,9,"Person 2","I mean I'm all for helping countries get more developed but some of them just don't want too. And honest people ahve to suffer because of it.","p024","p007",3,2,3,2.3333
2378,233,93,10,"Person 1","Yeah its hard to help people that don't help themselves.","p024","p007",2.3333,2,2,2
2379,233,93,11,"Person 2","I just hate that people have to deal with that stuff in general. Like I wish we as a species could get past the whole oversexualization thing. Like I get it's biological but damn no means no. Keep it in your pants ya dig?","p024","p007",3.6667,2,2.3333,3.3333
2380,233,93,12,"Person 1","Yeah its hard for some guys to do that","p024","p007",1.3333,2,1.6667,2
2381,233,93,13,"Person 2","Yea we had a big case here a couple of years ago where a cop was going around raping women. It was really messed up but he got thrown in jail for it.","p024","p007",3,2,0.6667,2
2382,233,93,14,"Person 1","at least some justice was made there but then again it was in a country where justice can be made sometimes.","p024","p007",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.6667
2383,233,93,15,"Person 2","Sad that it's only \"sometimes,\" but I guess that is better than never. It just sucks that people ahve to suffer around the world because of this crap.","p024","p007",4,2,3,3
2384,233,93,16,"Person 1","unfortunately we cant fix other countries which sucks","p024","p007",2.6667,2,2,2
2385,233,93,17,"Person 2","Yea it really does. You would think they would try to improve but I guess the people in power enjoy what they got going on.","p024","p007",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
2386,233,93,18,"Person 1","I'm assuming you know more about the subject and would know much more about this but as a man I can also sympathize with rape victims I can only imagine the feeling like no one is listening","p024","p007",3.3333,2,3,3.3333
2387,233,93,19,"Person 2","Yea it is pretty rough; it's evenw orse as a man because a lot of people think that because you are a man you can't be raped. Especially if you are sexually abused by a woman.","p024","p007",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
2388,233,93,20,"Person 1","yeah people think its fine if its a woman doing the raping","p024","p007",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
2389,233,93,21,"Person 2","Which it for sure isnt. Like if I don't want it it is the same as if ai woman doesn't want it. Doesn't help that it was in high school either at a time in my life where I was heavily depressed. Of course no one wants to lsisten to a high school kid about that though; especially in the bible belt.","p024","p007",3.3333,2,2.6667,3.3333
2390,233,93,22,"Person 1","i was always scared as a catholic to go to church as a kid and would always talk my mom out of going which probably turned out to save me in the long run","p024","p007",3.3333,2,2,3.3333
2391,233,93,23,"Person 2","How Ironic my family is catholic too!","p024","p007",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,3.3333
2392,233,93,24,"Person 1","That's cool! haha","p024","p007",2,0.3333,0.6667,1.6667
2393,233,93,25,"Person 2","Yea they were really hush hush about my issues. Kinda sucked; kinda forced religion on me but it is what it is.","p024","p007",3,2,0.6667,3.3333
2394,233,93,26,"Person 1","man that just sucks. I dont wanna get into details but I wish more would've been done to help you out.","p024","p007",2.6667,2,1,3
2395,233,93,27,"Person 2","Well now that I'm an adult i got the help I needed so it worked out in the end. It was just rough for a while.","p024","p007",3,1,1,2.6667
2396,233,93,28,"Person 1","That's great to know!","p024","p007",3,0,1,1.3333
2397,233,93,29,"Person 2","Yea I'm glad to be a functioning member of society now haha. I just wish those poor women in nigera could get the same amount of help I did. It isn't fair.","p024","p007",4,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
2398,233,93,30,"Person 1","yeah man we dont see how lucky we are to be born here","p024","p007",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
2399,233,93,31,"Person 2","True that.","p024","p007",1.6667,0.3333,1,1.3333
2400,233,93,32,"Person 1","Its been a good talk mturk friend! I think we did more than we needed haha. Goodbye.","p024","p007",2.3333,0,1,2
2401,233,93,33,"Person 2","bye","p024","p007",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
2402,233,94,0,"Person 1","It is a shame that these survivors were abused by the people they sought refuge from","p041","p063",2,2,2,1
2403,233,94,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I suppose that is just the type of lawlessness that exists in these countries.","p041","p063",2,2,2,1
2404,233,94,2,"Person 1","What do yo mean?","p041","p063",2,1,0,1
2405,233,94,3,"Person 2","In these countries where Islam is prominent, it's kind of the wild west.","p041","p063",3,1,2,1
2406,233,94,4,"Person 1","So you believe Nigeria is lawless because of Islam?","p041","p063",3,1,1,1
2407,233,94,5,"Person 2","No, I was merely stating that in any of these middle east and north african countries, these types of events are common.  Just so happens Islam exists there.","p041","p063",3,1,1,1
2408,233,94,6,"Person 1","I see. I saw it as more of an indication of corruption and dereliction. I hope they have provided adequate counseling services for the victims","p041","p063",3,2,2,1
2409,233,94,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it's really terrible that some of the women were impregnated by their abusers.  I don't know how the woman's relationship with the baby will develop after that.","p041","p063",2,2,2,1
2410,233,94,8,"Person 1","I don't know either. The guards at these camps should have been women","p041","p063",2,1,1,1
2411,233,94,9,"Person 2","I'm not sure I noticed in the article, but was the camp strictly for women?  If there were male victims included in there, that wouldn't be a possibility.","p041","p063",2,1,2,1
2412,233,94,10,"Person 1","The camps were not exclusively for women. But they should have been segregated for women and children","p041","p063",2,1,1,1
2413,233,94,11,"Person 2","Ideally, I think you're right, I just wonder what Nigeria's resources and capabilities are to provide for that.","p041","p063",2,1,1,1
2414,233,94,12,"Person 1","Nigeria is relatively wealthy compared to its neighbors on the continent. It is one of the wealthiest African nations. Their government has issues with corruption","p041","p063",3,2,2,1
2415,233,94,13,"Person 2","I wasn't aware that Nigeria was so wealthy.  I still think wealthy is a relative term when comparing to other African nations.  Especially when you see the issues they're struggling against like this Boko Haram.","p041","p063",3,2,1,1
2416,233,94,14,"Person 1","Nigeria has wealth stemming from the countries oil reserves. It is rich in a particular type of crude oil that has fewer impurities. But the country is corrupt and the wealth is not evenly distributed, which can lead to many other social problems","p041","p063",2,2,1,1
2448,233,95,0,"Person 1","What a terrible situation those people are in. I can't even begin to imagine what it's like.","p002","p038",3.3333,2,4.3333,2.6667
2449,233,95,1,"Person 2","Same here. To be treated like that by people who are in a leadership position. Using their power to abuse women. It's horrifying","p002","p038",3.6667,2,4.6667,2.6667
2450,233,95,2,"Person 1","I wonder if any of the workers who performed these acts have faces reprimands yet.","p002","p038",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
2451,233,95,3,"Person 2","Probably not.They'll probably just get a slap on the wrist and go on their way","p002","p038",2,2,2.3333,2
2452,233,95,4,"Person 1","Hard to think of a punishment that would be harsh enough. I don't think people like that can be rehabilitated.","p002","p038",3,2,2.3333,2
2453,233,95,5,"Person 2","I agree. They just think they are above everyone and nothing bad can happen to them. It's so messed up.","p002","p038",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
2454,233,95,6,"Person 1","I do not know much about the terror group that was talked about. Do you","p002","p038",1.3333,1,2,2
2455,233,95,7,"Person 2","No I'm not familiar with them at all. I guess I should pay more attention to whats going on in the world.","p002","p038",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
2456,233,95,8,"Person 1","I try to avoid some of the news. Stores like this really impact my emotions a lot. It would be hard for me to be around the people that performed these crimes.","p002","p038",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
2457,233,95,9,"Person 2","Same here. I couldn't do it. I'm not a violent person but I'm not sure what I would do if I were left alone with one of them. Death is too good for them. The state governor does sound like he wants to help though. Maybe he'll get something done?","p002","p038",3,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
2458,233,95,10,"Person 1","Maybe. One can hope that eventually the bad officials will be replaced with the moral leaders eventually.","p002","p038",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
2459,233,95,11,"Person 2","I hope so. I feel like they need to do something for these women. Provide counseling and medical care free of charge.","p002","p038",2.3333,1,3.3333,2.3333
2460,233,95,12,"Person 1","Counseling at least. PTSD would be probable from just the terror group experiences and then you have this added on top of those experiences.","p002","p038",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2461,233,95,13,"Person 2","Oh yeah absolutely. They will need extensive therepy and for the ones that got pregnant medical care will be necessary as well","p002","p038",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
2462,233,95,14,"Person 1","It would be super hard to raise a kid in that instance. You're already in a refuge camp barely able to take care of yourself and not you have to take care of another life.","p002","p038",3,2,4.3333,2.3333
2463,233,95,15,"Person 2","I know. I have to hand it to the women that do it.  I don't think I could. After going thru all that I just don't know if I could raise a child on top of it in that situation.","p002","p038",3,2,4,2.6667
2464,233,95,16,"Person 1","I have thought about situations related to this and if I was a woman I would seriously think about adoption. Can imagine the decision in the moment would be a lot harder though.","p002","p038",2.6667,2,4.6667,3
2465,233,95,17,"Person 2","It would be. To hand over your child to someone else has to be the most painful thing ever. I think I'd become very bitter","p002","p038",3.3333,2,4.3333,3
2466,233,95,18,"Person 1","I think the only way I could really give my kid up is if I saw the chance to give them an amazing life whereas the life with me would be all hardship.","p002","p038",2.6667,1.6667,4.3333,3.3333
2467,233,95,19,"Person 2","yeah. you always want better for your kid and I think giving them up to someone else would be the best option even though it hurts. So sad. My heart just breaks for these woman.","p002","p038",3.3333,2,5,2.6667
2468,233,95,20,"Person 1","In my opinion more aid should be sent to these areas rather than say Israel, a country that's already prosperous.","p002","p038",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
2469,233,95,21,"Person 2","I agree. These people need so much more help then some other countries we're helping need. I'd much prefer to see my tax dollars going to help people like these woman","p002","p038",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2470,233,95,22,"Person 1","I am almost willing to say I'd support troops being sent in this situation. People speak so loud about the \"war on terror\" but you rarely hear about this","p002","p038",2.3333,1,2.6667,2
2471,233,95,23,"Person 2","You don't! You never hear about things like this. People are so focused on the wrong things. Not that other countries don't need help and aid but I don't think some like you said Israel are as much in need as these people.","p002","p038",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
2472,233,95,24,"Person 1","I think the helpless feeling is kind of why I avoid really looking into these situations. I wish our aid could be given to the places that people want rather than where the top officials want.","p002","p038",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
2473,233,95,25,"Person 2","I agree. I wish we could choose. I mean I guess I could contribute to a charity that might send money there. But I also get iffy on charities and whether or not my money actually goes where its supposed to.","p002","p038",2,1,2.3333,2.6667
2474,233,95,26,"Person 1","Exactly my reason for not giving to the big charities. I would be willing to give money to a company that produces anti-rape devices though. I think they could help these women","p002","p038",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2475,233,95,27,"Person 2","Yes now thats something I could get behind and support. These women need them more then anyone","p002","p038",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,2
2476,233,95,28,"Person 1","It would add fear to the rapists as well. You never know who is wearing one! I think that's about all of my thoughts on this article though.","p002","p038",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
2477,233,95,29,"Person 2","same here its been great talking to you!","p002","p038",2.3333,0,0.3333,1.6667
2478,233,95,30,"Person 1","you as well, enjoyable conversation partner. bye","p002","p038",2,0.3333,0.3333,1.6667
2479,233,95,31,"Person 2","bye","p002","p038",1,1,0.3333,1
2480,57,96,0,"Person 1","I think it is really sad that those animals had to suffer. Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo in one of the most war torn areas in the middle east?","p007","p043",3,2,3.6667,2
2481,57,96,1,"Person 2","Yeah...I don't necessarily think the violence in the area had much to do with the terrible conditions in the zoo. The zoo owners cared more about profit than the conditions of the animals.","p007","p043",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
2482,57,96,2,"Person 1","That is for sure true; I just think the location for sure doesn't help. Either way though animals shouldn't have to suffer like that.","p007","p043",3,2,3,2
2483,57,96,3,"Person 2","The owners just weren't equipped, knowledge wise, for this task. I don't think the tiger being fed chicken all its life was a consequence of the area. The owners were just clueless and blamed the conflict for their inadequacy. And I agree, the animals are always innocent and I hope they are enjoying themselves right now!","p007","p043",2.6667,1.3333,3,2.6667
2484,57,96,4,"Person 1","This reminds me of another article I read for one of these HITs maybe 3 days ago; but there was another zoo where people were feeding the tigers mango because they couldn't afford to feed them meat. It was in Venezuela :(","p007","p043",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
2485,57,96,5,"Person 2","I can slightly understand that issue though. People in Venezuela have enough problems feeding themselves! It's truly a dire situation over there.","p007","p043",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
2486,57,96,6,"Person 1","Yea. Maybe it was greed at the pollitical level, but for sure not the zoo. I don't understand though why people feel the need to get exotic animals even though they cant properly take care of them; especially a zoo. People are really messed up when it comes to flipping a profit. Even the japanese are exploiting animals again for cash; they started whaling again. Well technically they never stopped but now it is official on paper again.","p007","p043",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
2487,57,96,7,"Person 2","Speaking of poaching, I had an article about elephant tusks a couple days back. And I later googled that elephant tusks go for around 400k. And in poor areas in Africa, that's basically lottery money. And at that point, I'm not sure you can even blame the poachers. You blame the people who are buying the ivory and elephant parts for ancient medicine stuff. It's disgusting that they think elephant or whale parts will affect diseases.","p007","p043",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
2488,57,96,8,"Person 1","Holy crap they are worth that much? Man that is so wrong. No wonder the problem is so persistant if the market is that good. Such a shame though. And yea I don't understand how some rhino horn can treat the common cold. That's just needless slaughter. Oh don't get me started on shark-fin soup either...","p007","p043",4,2,3.3333,2
2489,57,96,9,"Person 2","That price was from an article in 2016. And since they've outlawed the sale of all ivory, the price has probably doubled or tripled. The people who are hunting these amazing animals are decked out like soldiers...Anyway, this article really inspired me. A guy saw that animals were being mistreated and immediately started planning on how to save them.","p007","p043",2.3333,0,2.6667,2
2490,57,96,10,"Person 1","It always brings a smile to my face when people go out of their way to help animals in need. I used to volunteer at a shelter her ein my city. I love helping out rescued animals.","p007","p043",3.3333,0,3,2.6667
2491,57,96,11,"Person 2","That's commendable. If I had saw this though, I doubt I would've done anything. Most people would only go as far as complaining on social media. While this guy is having diplomatic talks with three different countries while navigating missiles and manages to rescue the animals!","p007","p043",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
2492,57,96,12,"Person 1","Yea that guys is legit going the distance. Truely a champion. It takes a lit of courage and resolve to go through all of that. I have never personally gone out and rescuded the animals, but I always groomed them, fed them, and made sure they could find a great home. I don't think I could pull a rescue operation in a warzone. I'd for sure crumble under the stress.","p007","p043",3,1,2.3333,2.6667
2493,57,96,13,"Person 2","You must've really wanted to adopt some of those animals too. It's so easy to get attached to them! And who knows, if America was a warzone, maybe you would've done something similar like this guy.","p007","p043",2.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
2494,57,96,14,"Person 1","I did adopt one actually haha! Best dog I've ever had. His owner had left him abandoned in a shed with no food for 3 weeks. Apparently used to beat him because he gets scared if you raise your hands. was really a mess when he came in but now hes the happiest boy you've ever seen.","p007","p043",3.3333,0,2.6667,3.3333
2495,57,96,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I've read about cases like that so often on Imgur. You just give them a little love and they are whole new animals.","p007","p043",2.3333,0,2,2

2497,57,96,17,"Person 2","And the sad thing is, even if you mistreat a dog so badly...They will still forgive you. And animal's ability to forgive far exceeds a humans.","p007","p043",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2498,57,96,18,"Person 1","Yea it is really sad. A dog will always be loyal. A blessing but also a curse. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt this dog; he is so sweet. But then again I can't see why anyone would abuse an animal. It's just wrong on so many levels.","p007","p043",3.3333,2,3,2
2499,57,96,19,"Person 2","Some people are so wounded inside that the only way they can cope is to wound something else, that is equally as powerless. Anyway, I hope that tiger is still roaming that sanctuary today. Also it would be nice if the guy from the article manages to set up that animal area in the Gaza strip that the article mentioned. It was nice talking to you.","p007","p043",3,1.3333,2.6667,2

2512,57,97,9,"Person 2","and most caged animals are smarter than we think and have feelings/emotions like we do.","p050","p024",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667

2528,57,98,6,"Person 1","I think more money should be allocated for zoos","p005","p050",1.3333,0.3333,2,1.6667

2543,57,99,1,"Person 2","let us talk about your feelings, how do you feel?","p030","p050",1.3333,1,0.3333,1.6667
2544,57,99,2,"Person 1","I think we're both supposed to share, but I'll start us off. I think that it is shameful that management attempted to blame armed conflict for the sordid conditions. I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place. Noble animals deserve respect and no matter how well maintained a zoo may be they are still imprisoning living creatures.","p030","p050",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
2545,57,99,3,"Person 2","Exactly...we shouldt even have zoos in the first place. The worst we should have is reserves. It is so sad we confine animals","p030","p050",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
2546,57,99,4,"Person 1","Not only were the animals starved to death, but their bodies were stuffed and mounted under the guise of posterity for a conflict that minimally affected the aggressor in the first place. I'm so glad that there are organizations out there keeping tabs on this kind of cruelty.","p030","p050",4,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
2547,57,99,5,"Person 2","It is such a relief. There should be more policies to discourage such acts","p030","p050",2.6667,0.3333,3,2
2548,57,99,6,"Person 1","I think that people involved in the Israel/Palestine conflict could care less about the lives of animals when their own lives (predominately Palestinians) are at risk. You were right when you said that zoos shouldn't be built in the first place, especially in war ridden areas.","p030","p050",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2549,57,99,7,"Person 2","Yes, No one wil have the time to look after them. There is hierarchy in human needs","p030","p050",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2550,57,99,8,"Person 1","It's not like going to a zoo like that would be a leisurely activity in the first place. Who would delight in watching as animals starve to death?","p030","p050",3,2,3,2.3333
2551,57,99,9,"Person 2","No one..I know I wont for sure. I cant stand such sight","p030","p050",2.6667,2,3,3

2554,57,99,12,"Person 1","It's hard to know what a person can do to support more missions like this. Especially since the organization responsible for the logistics is based in Germany I think? I guess the only thing you can do is donate money, but that is such a detached and mirthless way to support a worthy cause.","p030","p050",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2555,57,99,13,"Person 2","Yes. the best is money. Can we end the chat now?","p030","p050",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
2556,57,99,14,"Person 1","We need three more turns, actually.","p030","p050",1,1,0.3333,1
2557,57,99,15,"Person 2","Oooh. alright then. Are you willing to help any organization with donation?","p030","p050",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
2558,57,99,16,"Person 1","Definitely, I'd just have to do some research to find out where my money would be best spent. You?","p030","p050",2,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
2559,57,99,17,"Person 2","I guess I would do the same","p030","p050",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333

2565,57,100,3,"Person 2","It seems every day you pick up a newspaper or see it on TV where another animal was starved or not taken care of in zoos and circuses.   All for the $.  I live in Colorado and there's a wildlife viewing area.   There are 6,000 acres and animals roam freely.   I \"sort\" of think that's okay but you are still taking them out of their natural habitat.","p020","p010",2,2,2.3333,2.6667
2566,57,100,4,"Person 1","wow that is insane. it's sad when a wild animal attacks a person they get put down even though it was the humans fault.","p020","p010",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
2567,57,100,5,"Person 2","Oh my!  I could talk for days.  I live in the mountains.   There are bears, mountain lions, foxes, elk, bison, and deer to name a few.  They freely roam through our downtown, on the highways, etc. and we allow them to be wild.   We then have people come in from everywhere that no nothing about wildlife and provoke the animals for photos are whatever.  The animal charges, hurts the individual and then Department of WIldlife has to put it down (:","p020","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
2568,57,100,6,"Person 1","aww that breaks my heart! where I live we have a bunch of deer. I love going outside the morning after it snows to see all the deer tracks. It makes me so sad to think that people put down these animals when they really don't do anything wrong.","p020","p010",3.3333,2,4,3.6667
2569,57,100,7,"Person 2","I know.  There are lots of protests going on here about not doing that - we will see.   This article we read was crazy even to think about opening a new zoo there.","p020","p010",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
2570,57,100,8,"Person 1","yes, it is so sad. all for entertainment with no care about the animals wellbeing. I do not understand how someone can sleep at night knowing they did that.","p020","p010",3,2,3.6667,2.3333

2588,67,101,3,"Person 2","You'd think they'd try to set some official migration routes or something. It is saddening that women and children have to risk their lives crossing the sea.","p001","p007",3.3333,2,3,2.3333

2590,67,101,5,"Person 2","Exactly. A lot of needless death and risk. I can't imagine being stuck in a rickety overcrowded boat in the middle of the ocean.","p001","p007",2.6667,2,3,2.6667

2593,67,101,8,"Person 1","i guess they are just worried about the implications of seemingly \"Allowing\" the migrants,so they are stuck in this dangerous quasi place where the migrants have the incentive but are still unsure enough where it's not 100 percent sure thing","p001","p007",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
2594,67,101,9,"Person 2","Yea that makes sense. We are currently going through that immigration struggle as well. It's just a messed up situation in both places.","p001","p007",3,1.6667,3.3333,2

2597,67,101,12,"Person 1","it's weird though,i feel like i sometimes experience both extremes within myself....i want immigrants/migrants to come in the proper way but it's awful seeing people dying when all they want is a better life","p001","p007",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3
2598,67,101,13,"Person 2","Likewise, I feel like we need reform, but people trying to get in and getting hurt sucks. Like if the system wasn't so bad I feel like people would just try to get in officially instead of sneaking in. But you never know. There isn't an esy solution.","p001","p007",2,1.6667,3,3
2599,67,101,14,"Person 1","i guess that's a big issue,the offical immigration process itself...my parents immigrated from croatia and from what they've told me, i know it isn't the easiest thing in the world","p001","p007",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3.6667
2600,67,101,15,"Person 2","Yea the process is hard, and long. I guess that is why people just try to sneak in. Sometime sthey can't afford to wait for all the red tape.","p001","p007",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
2601,67,101,16,"Person 1","i guess in an ideal world they wouldn't even have to leave their countries....i'm sure they'd rather stay","p001","p007",2,1.3333,3,2
2602,67,101,17,"Person 2","Yea true that. It is pretty sad to beging with that people have to leave their homes because of the pollitical/economic climate their home country has.","p001","p007",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
2603,67,101,18,"Person 1","and we can't really help on that front either...since you know,our foreign involvements don't usually end up going very well,lol","p001","p007",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

2616,67,102,7,"Person 2","I thought things like life jacket should be used and prevents deaths","p038","p005",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
2617,67,102,8,"Person 1","I wonder if there wasn't any on board","p038","p005",1,1,1.3333,1.3333

2620,67,102,11,"Person 2","I would support that as well. That would be negligent on the part of the ship owner","p038","p005",1.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
2621,67,102,12,"Person 1","I'm sure people will sue regardless it sounds like there was something wrong with the ship","p038","p005",1,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
2622,67,102,13,"Person 2","what do you think can be done to prevent further occurrence?","p038","p005",0.6667,1,1,1
2623,67,102,14,"Person 1","I'm not sure. Maybe more regulations about ship safety and checking things more and making sure its up to code?","p038","p005",0.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
2624,67,102,15,"Person 2","Or also providing a sure escape measures in cases of shipwrecks.","p038","p005",0.6667,1.3333,3,1

2639,67,103,6,"Person 1","why? is not human history to spread out and move around?","p035","p050",0.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
2640,67,103,7,"Person 2","It is, but there are safer routes","p035","p050",0.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667

2642,67,103,9,"Person 2","They could have flown","p035","p050",0.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667

2656,67,103,23,"Person 2","bye","p035","p050",0.3333,1,0.3333,1
2657,67,104,0,"Person 1","The migrant situation all around the world seems to be in shambles but having 4,000+ people go missing in one area should not ever happen.","p002","p043",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2658,67,104,1,"Person 2","Yeah, it's a shame. There must be a safer way to transport these people than them having to take their chances on an overcrowded boat.","p002","p043",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2659,67,104,2,"Person 1","I can imagine that would not be difficult. Seems like this stems from a larger view that people have against immigration at this time.","p002","p043",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
2660,67,104,3,"Person 2","I'm not certain this has anything to do with immigration because the countries they are fleeing to will accept them. Even the coyotes or whoever these people are paying to transport them to different countries are misleading them. As in the article, it said that the leaders of these trips are saying that if you get saved, they will take you back to Libya.","p002","p043",1,1.3333,3,2
2661,67,104,4,"Person 1","I guess there are limited paths that can be taken from Africa where I guess they are fleeing. A land path would be a lot safer but I do not think countries would allow these immigrants to travel through them. That is why I said it was an immigration problem.","p002","p043",1,1.3333,2.6667,2
2662,67,104,5,"Person 2","Yeah, that's true. I didn't consider that. I think a land trip would be even more perilous. It would take longer and the already poor people would need more supplies. And how are they going to carry those supplies?","p002","p043",2,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
2663,67,104,6,"Person 1","I'm not sure. I guess they would need assistance. Rather than being transported on boats, buses or trains could be used.","p002","p043",0.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
2664,67,104,7,"Person 2","As mentioned in the article regarding the rescue boats, I think the responsibility of transporting these people should go to the country that's willing to accept them. I don't think the cost would be that exorbitant.","p002","p043",0.6667,1,2.3333,2
2665,67,104,8,"Person 1","I can't imagine any country willing to take on that task. I can imagine that a lot of the citizens would voice opposition. Most reports that I have seen speak of citizens barely wanting to accept migrants let alone foot the bill for transportation.","p002","p043",1,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
2666,67,104,9,"Person 2","That doesn't make sense, as the countries that receive these people are going to pay their living costs for years. Coming off that boat, these people will only have the clothes on their back. They will likely also need to be taught the local language. The big problem with immigration is the government in on the hook for the needs of the people for a long time.","p002","p043",1.6667,1,3,2
2667,67,104,10,"Person 1","Pay their total living costs for years to come? I would imagine that these people will be able to contribute towards their cost of living with skills and labor. The government being on the hook is my point exactly when I say that the host country's citizens are against this. I see way more reports about opposition to immigration compared to acceptance.","p002","p043",2,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
2668,67,104,11,"Person 2","Some people will likely be educated enough to support themselves. I think the majority would need assistance for quite a while. Housing assistance, education assistance, food assistance ect will be required for these people to survive. A few years ago Germany offered to pay migrants a full years worth of rent costs to return home. They also offered to give a lump sum for the migrants to open a business in their home country. This migration and the costs assorted with it are why some Europeans are electing conservative politicians. It's entirely why brexit happened, as the EU was forcing countries to accept migrants.","p002","p043",1,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
2669,67,104,12,"Person 1","Exactly why I say that the larger problem/major cause as to why over 4k people have been lost is due to the larger view many have against immigration. Many of these people would be able to perform basic labor jobs. They could benefit the host country's rather than be a drain if utilized correctly.","p002","p043",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
2670,67,104,13,"Person 2","4k people have been lost because the people are desperate. And even if the boat idea doesn't seem like a good one, they will take that chance anyway. Some countries have problems with immigration but others, like Germany, are still accepting people with open arms. The EU in general is still pro immigration. And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket. And I think you're underestimating how difficult it will be for these people to assimilate. Maybe it's different in others places but I highly doubt I could get a job anywhere if I couldn't speak the language.","p002","p043",2.6667,1.6667,4,2.6667
2671,67,104,14,"Person 1","I would hope that the earlier migrants would be able to help people assimilate or they can create mini communities as we have in the USA. These things take time I guess and the EU is in the beginning stages in some country's. I guess I underestimate the difficulty as I see tons of immigrants in the US find work when they arrive.","p002","p043",2,0.6667,3.3333,2.3333
2672,67,104,15,"Person 2","Yeah, it's easier to assimilate here as no matter what ethnicity you are, there's pockets of that group of people living together in every major city.","p002","p043",1,0.6667,3,2.3333
2673,67,104,16,"Person 1","I think private businesses offering transportation may be able to lessen the deaths during the migration rather than depend on governments.","p002","p043",0.6667,0.6667,3,2
2674,67,104,17,"Person 2","Maybe if it was a massive, massive company like Apple or Amazon. Even then, I doubt it would happen if the company was publicly traded. They'd get rid of that CEO ASAP. It would have to be the government as they would rightfully take losses to protect the lives of people. I don't think it's that crazy to ask the EU to help transport these people. Unless the representatives of the countries are only virtue signaling and don't actually want to accept the people.","p002","p043",2.3333,1,2.6667,2
2675,67,104,18,"Person 1","Optimally it would be private company's paid for by the governments so I guess that would be the same as the EU paying the bill/taking on the responsibility.","p002","p043",0.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
2676,67,104,19,"Person 2","That sounds like a good solution. I'm hoping that the article was a bit old and migrants aren't drowning as often now-a-days. It was nice talking to you, have a good night. bye","p002","p043",1.6667,0,2.3333,2
2677,67,104,20,"Person 1","you as well. bye","p002","p043",0.3333,0,0.6667,1.6667
2678,67,105,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about these people being displaced by extreme violence and perishing despite the fact that they made it out alive?","p030","p068",3,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
2679,67,105,1,"Person 2","it is horrifying to make it that far and just die","p030","p068",4.3333,2,3,2.3333
2680,67,105,2,"Person 1","And the article mentioned that the E.U. was still more focused on preventing these people from reaching their shores than protection and integration.","p030","p068",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
2681,67,105,3,"Person 2","yes it is crazy there should be more aid to thm with human life at risk","p030","p068",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
2682,67,105,4,"Person 1","How do you think they rationalize this kind of response to such a crisis?","p030","p068",2,1,1.3333,1.3333
2683,67,105,5,"Person 2","probably like here that they dont know these people and dont want them coming in the country","p030","p068",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
2684,67,105,6,"Person 1","Do you think that immigration and cultural diversity is ultimately a positive or negative influence on an economy?","p030","p068",1,1,1.3333,1
2685,67,105,7,"Person 2","it can go both ways. I think illigal immigration is bad, not nowing the people coming in. But diversity is great","p030","p068",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2686,67,105,8,"Person 1","This specific circumstance would be asylum seekers, meaning they are literally fleeing their country to preserve their lives. I think that intake and acclimation centers would come at a hefty cost, but the contributions of asylum seekers would pretty rapidly outweigh any initial expenditure.","p030","p068",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
2687,67,105,9,"Person 2","That is true it could be a greatinvestment as these people would be gratefulto live and work there","p030","p068",2.6667,0,3.3333,2

2689,67,105,11,"Person 2","Yes this is true they could utilize them to advance there own society","p030","p068",2,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333

2692,67,105,14,"Person 1","I can understand the E.U.'s position though since the U.S. and Russian Federation have been the major players in both the Lybian and Syrian conflicts.","p030","p068",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
2693,67,105,15,"Person 2","True they would want to stay neutral and not really get involved or take sides","p030","p068",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1

2700,134,106,2,"Person 1","It's messed up. So you mainly think the company should pay for all the damages?","p022","p007",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
2701,134,106,3,"Person 2","Well at the very least I think they should make more of an effort to help better the situation. After all it is their mess that is impacting the lives of a lot of people that live off the river. Well lived. They can't really live off of it that well now anyways.","p022","p007",3,1.6667,2.6667,3
2702,134,106,4,"Person 1","True. I don't remember if i read it, but i hope there weren't any casualties in this situation.","p022","p007",2,1.3333,1,2.3333
2703,134,106,5,"Person 2","I don't recall if there were any human casualties, but tons of wildlife for sure. The local environment there must be incredibly messed up from all that polluted water.","p022","p007",3,2,1.6667,2.3333
2704,134,106,6,"Person 1","Definitely. I'm sure that affects the whole ecosystem as well. Sort of reminds me of Flint","p022","p007",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
2705,134,106,7,"Person 2","Isn't Flint still messed up? Or did they ever resolve that situation","p022","p007",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
2706,134,106,8,"Person 1","It's still messed up from what i've seen on television and articles that i've read. :(","p022","p007",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
2707,134,106,9,"Person 2","Man thats sad. The water supply getting borked messes up so much stuff. I wonder what kind of pollutants were in that mining waste. I know gold miners us emercury to form an amalgam with the gold to catch it from the panning machines. I hope it isnt a ton of heavy metals/mercury in that river.","p022","p007",2.3333,2,3.3333,3
2708,134,106,10,"Person 1","Hm i have no knowledge of that at all but yeah, i hope noone got sick or died from that.","p022","p007",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
2709,134,106,11,"Person 2","Same. Although theya re smart to not drink that water. That can cause a lot of problems down the line.","p022","p007",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
2710,134,106,12,"Person 1","Do you think you would ever donate to a cause like that to help the people?","p022","p007",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
2711,134,106,13,"Person 2","Of course. As long as the money is actually going to help.","p022","p007",2.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
2712,134,106,14,"Person 1","Agreed. I'm pretty sure people and celebrities have donated a ton to Flint but yet, they're still in the same position.","p022","p007",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
2713,134,106,15,"Person 2","Yea, makes you wonder where all that money is going.","p022","p007",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
2714,134,106,16,"Person 1","I'll be thinking about that before i go to sleep tonight lol. Nice talking to you!","p022","p007",2,1.3333,2,2
2715,134,106,17,"Person 2","We aren't done yet; it is 10 messages each. This message is the 9th :) But yea either way companies should totally be held accountable for their pollution.","p022","p007",2,1.3333,1,1.3333
2716,134,106,18,"Person 1","Oh sorry about that. I counted the code as a line. Do you think it has anything to do with the climate changing causing the mud slide","p022","p007",2,1,1,1
2717,134,106,19,"Person 2","You know it is possible but it could also be a man made disaster. Either way im surprised there were no precautions in place to keep the waste from getting in the river in general.","p022","p007",2.3333,1,2,2.3333
2718,134,106,20,"Person 1","Yeah, it's a terrible situation overall. Freak accident.. kinda","p022","p007",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
2719,134,106,21,"Person 2","Yea I just hope things improve for those people, and the wildlife.","p022","p007",3,0.6667,3,1.6667
2720,134,106,22,"Person 1","Yup. Fingers crossed!","p022","p007",2,0,1.6667,1.3333
2721,134,106,23,"Person 2","Well we are at 10 now if you wanna stop","p022","p007",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.6667
2722,134,106,24,"Person 1","okay. It was nice talking to you! Hope you didn't think i was trying to leave early because i didn't want to talk to you lol","p022","p007",1.6667,0.6667,1,1.6667
2723,134,106,25,"Person 2","No no it's all good haha.","p022","p007",1.3333,0,0.6667,1.3333
2724,134,106,26,"Person 1","bye !","p022","p007",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
2725,134,106,27,"Person 2","bye","p022","p007",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
2726,134,107,0,"Person 1","So, how did you respond to the article?","p030","p055",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
2727,134,107,1,"Person 2","I think it's so terrible and horribly sad. Just another reminder of the damage we are continuing to do to the environment and the earth.","p030","p055",3.6667,2,3.6667,3
2728,134,107,2,"Person 1","Are you able to empathize with the people who are responsible for the spill and the subsequent clean up? Meaning, can you picture yourself being so concerned with money that you are effectively willing to destroy people's livelihoods?","p030","p055",1,1.3333,2.6667,2
2729,134,107,3,"Person 2","I can understanding needing and wanting money and doing things you don't like to get it. But I can't imagine getting money in such a way that I'd hurt so many other people in the process and ruin an entire river. I can't imagine being that kind of person.","p030","p055",3,1.6667,3,3.3333
2730,134,107,4,"Person 1","I think there's a sociopathic dehumanization that occurs in people like that. Like, the people potentially affected are seen as so far beneath them that they can't effectively relate to their circumstances.","p030","p055",1,1.6667,3,3
2731,134,107,5,"Person 2","I don't know if they even really think about other people at all. I mean, I feel that someone so focused on their own wealth above all else doesn't even take the time to consider other people in their plans at all. I don't think they even care as long as they are obtaining their goals.","p030","p055",2,1.6667,3.6667,3
2732,134,107,6,"Person 1","I think you are probably correct. I wish it would have specified what kind of mine it was. We can't keep raping the earth for corporate gain.","p030","p055",2.3333,2,2.3333,3
2733,134,107,7,"Person 2","No we can't. I don't think it really even matters what kind of mine it was. There isn't anything in the earth worth damaging an entire river and disrupting so many people's lives.","p030","p055",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,3
2734,134,107,8,"Person 1","What would you consider an alternative to these destructive practices?","p030","p055",0.6667,1,2,1
2735,134,107,9,"Person 2","Well altneratives really depend on what type of mine it was. Basically for coal stop using fossils fuels. We have the ability to use wind, solar and water and we need to focus more on that. For minerals and gold and such, we need to figure out new manufacturing processes or start limiting the desire for those types of things so that mining isn't worth it.","p030","p055",0.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
2736,134,107,10,"Person 1","Considering the fact that diamonds can now be convincingly replicated in laboratories, I can't see why the future might not unveil a sort of alchemical equivalent of changing abundant materials into formerly rare materials.","p030","p055",0.6667,0.3333,2,2.3333
2737,134,107,11,"Person 2","That would be a nice thought. It's going to take some major changes from everyone on earth to make a difference. I hope that we wake up to that and start now. It can't be done overnight and we need to start somewhere.","p030","p055",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,2.6667
2738,134,107,12,"Person 1","The pessimist in me often entertains the thought that we have passed a point of no return when it comes to our environment. I believe that a low energy future will be visited upon humanity by force, not by choice.","p030","p055",2.3333,2,1.6667,3
2739,134,107,13,"Person 2","I am afraid that for a lot of things you might be right. I'd hope we could make the change because it's the right thing to do. However, I fear that for a lot of things it's going to come down to we have no other choice. Sad to think, but people don't often change unless forced to.","p030","p055",3,1.6667,3,3
2740,134,107,14,"Person 1","Change is scary. People are afraid of what they don't understand and that is why human society has had no long lasting fundamental shifts in centuries. Our only hope is that our past won't be forgotten once we get a chance to start over.","p030","p055",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
2741,134,107,15,"Person 2","I'd like to hope that we'd learn from our mistakes, but it seems we only learn the lesson for so long and then we backslide. I think it's not even so much fearing the change as the fact that so many people fear for their money and industry that makes money now are things we need to move away from.","p030","p055",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2742,134,107,16,"Person 1","Do you feel that free market capitalism is a viable ideology moving forward?","p030","p055",0.6667,1,1.6667,1
2743,134,107,17,"Person 2","I think it would be if it was a true free market system. But too often we say it's free market and yet we bail out companies because they are \"too big to fail\" but in a true free market if you fail you fail.","p030","p055",1,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
2744,134,107,18,"Person 1","Hey, I really enjoyed our chat! Have a good one! bye","p030","p055",2.3333,0.3333,0.6667,2.3333
2745,134,107,19,"Person 2","Thanks for chatting. goodbye","p030","p055",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
2746,134,108,0,"Person 1","This is a depressing thing that happened","p024","p038",2.6667,2,3.6667,1.6667
2747,134,108,1,"Person 2","It is. I can't imagine having water that is so polluted like that.","p024","p038",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
2748,134,108,2,"Person 1","I don't know if I wouldnt just not drink water at all in those conditions.","p024","p038",1.6667,2,3,2.6667
2749,134,108,3,"Person 2","I don't think I would. I wouldn't be able to think about anything but mud. I don't think I'd mind giving up the fish either.","p024","p038",2,1.5,4,2.3333
2750,134,108,4,"Person 1","I would definitely starve myself in those conditions.","p024","p038",2.3333,1.5,2.3333,2.6667
2751,134,108,5,"Person 2","At least they're getting some compensation","p024","p038",1.3333,0.5,2.6667,1
2752,134,108,6,"Person 1","true but is it enough","p024","p038",1.3333,1.5,2,1
2753,134,108,7,"Person 2","Thats what I was wondering. $400 a month plus $80 for each dependent sounds like a lot but I don't know the cost of living there","p024","p038",2,1.5,2.6667,2
2754,134,108,8,"Person 1","youre right the cost of living is probably lower there than in the usa","p024","p038",1,0.5,2,2
2755,134,108,9,"Person 2","It sounds like the people down near the river were the most affected and getting the compensation and that sounds like a poor area to me. I could be wrong but that money could go a long way.","p024","p038",1.3333,1.5,2.3333,2
2756,134,108,10,"Person 1","some people gathered by an aquifer in the city  and filled up plastid jugs for family so that was good","p024","p038",2.3333,1.5,1.6667,1.6667
2757,134,108,11,"Person 2","yeah at least they got some clean water. That must have been a blessing","p024","p038",2.6667,0,3,2.3333
2758,134,108,12,"Person 1","yeah I can only imagine the taste after drinking all that dirty water","p024","p038",2.6667,1,3.3333,2
2759,134,108,13,"Person 2","I wonder if they have plenty to eat other then fish","p024","p038",1.3333,1,3,1.3333
2760,134,108,14,"Person 1","probably not","p024","p038",0.6667,1.5,1,1
2761,134,108,15,"Person 2","ugh I'm thankful I've never had to encounter things lke this","p024","p038",3,0,2.3333,2.6667
2762,134,108,16,"Person 1","It probably is a good thing we were born here.","p024","p038",2.3333,0.5,2,2.6667
2763,134,108,17,"Person 2","yeah reading stuff like this makes me even more grateful to live here","p024","p038",3.3333,0.5,2,2.6667
2764,134,108,18,"Person 1","Hopefully things get better around the world.","p024","p038",2.6667,0.5,2.6667,2

2772,134,109,1,"Person 2","hello, that was really tough to read, hearing about how many people are financially impacted by that mud flood","p050","p014",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
2773,134,109,2,"Person 1","It is so sad...I wish it was averted","p050","p014",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
2774,134,109,3,"Person 2","its beyond a year later, and it doesn't seem like any normalcy has returned","p050","p014",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.3333
2775,134,109,4,"Person 1","Yes, the aftermath is still there. It might take some five years","p050","p014",2,2,3,1.3333
2776,134,109,5,"Person 2","if at all. I think there needs to be more of a restoration or cleanup effort.","p050","p014",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
2777,134,109,6,"Person 1","Exactly. I dont think that is in place yet","p050","p014",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
2778,134,109,7,"Person 2","they have tried some minor things, like trying to replant the river banks, but it sounded ineffective and sloppy","p050","p014",2,2,2.3333,1
2779,134,109,8,"Person 1","Tree planting will help. I just hope they are deeply rooted. They should build artificial embankments also","p050","p014",2.3333,0.3333,3,1.6667
2780,134,109,9,"Person 2","yeah, the damages the company paid to the people also seem really small compared to what they are losing out on","p050","p014",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
2781,134,109,10,"Person 1","it is so sad and terrible","p050","p014",3.3333,2,3,2
2782,134,109,11,"Person 2","I'm surprised more people are causing a bigger stir, they certainly have a right to be upset","p050","p014",2.3333,2,3,2.3333

2785,134,109,14,"Person 1","Personally, i would move. I am sure most people would love to move too, but where is the resources?","p050","p014",2,1.3333,3,2.6667

2808,134,110,17,"Person 2","I do not know, I guess wait on aid and deal with what they have?","p068","p029",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
2809,134,110,18,"Person 1","the poor fish two died so slowly","p068","p029",3,2,4.3333,1.6667
2810,134,110,19,"Person 2","yeah seriously!  not just people.  well I gotta go, nice talking to you!  bye","p068","p029",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
2811,134,110,20,"Person 1","great bye!","p068","p029",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
2812,45,111,0,"Person 1","This conflict is a mess but I can't pretend like I really care.","p062","p035",2,1.3333,1,2.6667
2813,45,111,1,"Person 2","I care because it involves human life","p062","p035",3,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
2814,45,111,2,"Person 1","Sure, I understand that.  But people are about as valuable as cockroaches from a certain perspective.  And these people are about cockroaches from any perspective.","p062","p035",2,1.6667,1,3
2815,45,111,3,"Person 2","That is a bad way of looking at things.","p062","p035",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
2816,45,111,4,"Person 1","I'd say it's just a certain perspective.  Besides, I'm realistic about war.  There's going to be collateral damage.  If you fight in a war you should fight to win, and that means some \"innocents\" getting killed.","p062","p035",2.3333,1,1,2.3333
2817,45,111,5,"Person 2","So you believe there should be no rules in war?","p062","p035",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
2818,45,111,6,"Person 1","Pretty much.  I mean, there are considerations to be made.  Like, if we violate the Geneva Convention it all but assures there will be ramifications for our troops.  But war is life and death.  I believe that if you aren't willing to fight in a way that MOST protects your own troops and your own nation, then you shouldn't fight at all.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,3.3333
2819,45,111,7,"Person 2","so your okay with 911, because they believed they were at war with the US.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
2820,45,111,8,"Person 1","If I were one of them I'd be okay with it.  From an objective perspective I don't think there's any authority that should prevent someone from doing that if that's what they think is right.  But obviously I don't agree with it because it affected my home country.  I understand your point but it really doesn't change anything I've said.","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,3.3333
2821,45,111,9,"Person 2","I would do anything to protect my family, but I do not  go looking for trouble. I'm glad you can see it from an objective point of view because most can not.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,3.3333
2822,45,111,10,"Person 1","Sure, I understand that.  But that's sort of my point.  I'm going to look out for my interests.  You're going to look out for yours.  I'm not going to look for trouble.  But if trouble finds me, whoa nelly, look out.  Why should I play by a set of \"feel good\" rules and harm myself in the process.","p062","p035",3,1,1.3333,3.3333
2823,45,111,11,"Person 2","Without rules and with today's technology we will destroy each other.","p062","p035",2,2,0.6667,2.3333
2824,45,111,12,"Person 1","So give me your perspective on Yemen.  How do you think that problem should be dealt with?  Keep fighting the Houtis, or concede and allow them to take over the country and government they've overthrown (with Iran's backing).","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.6667
2825,45,111,13,"Person 2","To be honest, I would like them fight and only give aid to the citizens.","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
2826,45,111,14,"Person 1","So just let the old regime and the Houthi rebels fight, and whoever wins gets to control the country?  While the rest of the world stays out of it except for aid?","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.3333
2827,45,111,15,"Person 2","Look at the US involvement in the middle east. Iraq is worst and Libya is now a hell hole.","p062","p035",3,2,1.6667,2
2828,45,111,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I'm not arguing with what you said (although I personally don't agree).  I'm just trying to understand.  Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region?","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333
2829,45,111,17,"Person 2","We do not live over there, We can not say why they are fighting. We only get news reported to us. I do not think Iran can do any major damage to the US.","p062","p035",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
2830,45,111,18,"Person 1","I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb.","p062","p035",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
2831,45,111,19,"Person 2","By your own logic, Israel if full of coach roaches too, (I do not agree) So why care what happens to them?","p062","p035",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
2832,45,111,20,"Person 1","Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst.","p062","p035",3.3333,2,1,3
2833,45,111,21,"Person 2","I agree, but we are not messing with Russia or China if we really wanted to go after the bad guys.","p062","p035",2,1.6667,0.6667,2
2834,45,111,22,"Person 1","We should do more with them, I think.  Not a hot war, where the ramifications are too great though.  See, I'm realistic too.  Anyway, interesting chat.  Thanks.  bye","p062","p035",2.3333,0.6667,1,2
2835,45,111,23,"Person 2","You too, bye","p062","p035",1,1,0.6667,1
2836,45,112,0,"Person 1","But really, can we just stop all the wars?","p050","p024",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
2837,45,112,1,"Person 2","for real that is the truth","p050","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
2838,45,112,2,"Person 1","It is the selfishness of man that keep hurting humanity.","p050","p024",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
2839,45,112,3,"Person 2","im a man and all but do you think this would happen if females ran the world ?","p050","p024",1,1,2.6667,2
2840,45,112,4,"Person 1","Countries will be jealous of each other...lol","p050","p024",2.3333,1.3333,1,2
2841,45,112,5,"Person 2","Thats true I didn't think of that one.","p050","p024",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
2842,45,112,6,"Person 1","lol..That is on a lighter note.","p050","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1,1.3333
2843,45,112,7,"Person 2","yeah you just have to pray for victims of war","p050","p024",2,1,4,2.6667
2844,45,112,8,"Person 1","Exactly..that is the best we can do","p050","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
2845,45,112,9,"Person 2","unfortunately thats enough for the families of the victims","p050","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667

2849,45,112,13,"Person 2","our country should help","p050","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2

2859,45,113,5,"Person 2","What do you think we can do about it?","p005","p022",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1
2860,45,113,6,"Person 1","I think we need to understand the reason why that happened first?","p005","p022",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
2861,45,113,7,"Person 2","I think it's just relations. I mean, what do you think we can do to stop the killing of the air airdrops on innocent ppls","p005","p022",1.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
2862,45,113,8,"Person 1","I think they should always be sure of the target they are hitting?","p005","p022",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667

2921,45,115,23,"Person 2","you too! Thank you! bye","p007","p038",2,0,0.6667,1
2922,9,116,0,"Person 1","what are you feelings about the incident?","p005","p055",1,1,0.6667,1
2923,9,116,1,"Person 2","Earthquakes are so scary. I'm from California and I know how tough they can be to deal with. But to hear of people stealing from those that suffered an earthquake is sickening.","p005","p055",4.3333,2,4.3333,3
2924,9,116,2,"Person 1","I was so pissed reading that","p005","p055",4,2,3.3333,2
2925,9,116,3,"Person 2","Yeah seems like such a shame. People should be coming together not trying to benefit off the suffering of others.","p005","p055",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
2926,9,116,4,"Person 1","Yes, in difficult time as that. I think what we should be thinking is a way to help the victims and not steal from them","p005","p055",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
2927,9,116,5,"Person 2","Exactly. Earthquakes are devastating and so scary because there is so little you can do about them. Then you need to have people support you not steal from you.","p005","p055",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
2928,9,116,6,"Person 1","It's really sickening","p005","p055",4,2,3,2
2929,9,116,7,"Person 2","Yeah, imagine having the world move under you and then when you're struggling to see what you have left, who is okay. Someone comes along and wants to steal your stuff. Terrible.","p005","p055",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
2930,9,116,8,"Person 1","That would really make the victims sad the more","p005","p055",3.6667,2,4.3333,1.6667
2931,9,116,9,"Person 2","Talk about being violated twice. Suffer the disaster than rather than getting help the people in your community want to take what little might have survived the quake. Crazy.","p005","p055",3,2,4,2.3333
2932,9,116,10,"Person 1","what do you think can be done to curb this shameless act?","p005","p055",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1
2933,9,116,11,"Person 2","I'm not sure there is anything. Other than worse punishments for those caught stealing and looting. But it's so hard to prove that when the world around you is in such chaos. I mean the police have other things to focus on at that time.","p005","p055",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2
2934,9,116,12,"Person 1","Sure, but still there should be a balance","p005","p055",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
2935,9,116,13,"Person 2","You'd like to think so. I'd like to believe people would just be kinder and nicer to one another. However, it seems like people are so much out for themselves and not worrying about others. It's hard to say if things can be brought into balance.","p005","p055",3,1.6667,4,2
2936,9,116,14,"Person 1","I think there should be awareness or something?","p005","p055",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
2937,9,116,15,"Person 2","You'd think there would be. However, people are so self centered right now. Everyone feels that they are owed things and it's about their needs and not necessarily about the greater good.","p005","p055",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
2938,9,116,16,"Person 1","I totally agree with you.....It is really just sad","p005","p055",3.3333,2,4,2
2939,9,116,17,"Person 2","It is sad. I mean at such a time when it's like the world is against you with a quake, you'd think people would see a bigger picture, but it seems they don't anymore.","p005","p055",3,2,3,2
2940,9,116,18,"Person 1","it's as if we are losing our humanity","p005","p055",2.6667,2,3,2
2941,9,116,19,"Person 2","It does seem so. I think social media makes us see people different now. We don't see \"people\" and we have less human interaction now. I think we just don't feel we connect like we used to anymore.","p005","p055",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
2942,9,116,20,"Person 1","sure, you are right.....goodbye","p005","p055",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
2943,9,116,21,"Person 2","Thanks for the chat. goodbye","p005","p055",1.6667,0.6667,0.3333,1
2944,9,117,0,"Person 1","That is just a terrible quake that happened in New Zealand","p024","p001",3.3333,2,3,1.6667
2945,9,117,1,"Person 2","yea,horrible...and really scary","p024","p001",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
2946,9,117,2,"Person 1","I've personally experienced earthquakes and they are scary","p024","p001",3.3333,2,1.6667,3.6667
2947,9,117,3,"Person 2","i can't imagine living in an earthquake prone area.....i'd be constantly worried","p024","p001",2.6667,2,3.6667,3
2948,9,117,4,"Person 1","being from California you get used to them but you always wonder if its the big one when they are occuring","p024","p001",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
2949,9,117,5,"Person 2","sure hope they could come up with a more accurate early detection system","p024","p001",2,0.6667,2.3333,2
2950,9,117,6,"Person 1","yeah that seems like theyll never find a way","p024","p001",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
2951,9,117,7,"Person 2","how often do you experience earthquakes?","p024","p001",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
2952,9,117,8,"Person 1","usually every year during the summer here in california","p024","p001",1.3333,1,0.6667,2.6667
2953,9,117,9,"Person 2","that's interesting,so they are more common in summer?","p024","p001",2,1,0.6667,1
2954,9,117,10,"Person 1","from my experience although im no expert i feel them during the summer mostly","p024","p001",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,2.3333
2955,9,117,11,"Person 2","did you feel the most recent \"bigger one\" that was in the news recently?","p024","p001",1.3333,1.3333,1,1
2956,9,117,12,"Person 1","i sure did that one did last pretty long","p024","p001",2.3333,1.3333,0.6667,3.3333
2957,9,117,13,"Person 2","wow...what does it exactly feel like? i imagine it feeling like your in a boat or something,like wavy sort of","p024","p001",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
2958,9,117,14,"Person 1","its like if your on top of a wood plank and someone under has control of the movement moving it side to side or however they want like wavy","p024","p001",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
2959,9,117,15,"Person 2","interesting...would you say that most houses/buildings in California are able to withstand a decent sized one? like how safe do you feel when it happens","p024","p001",2,1,1,1.3333
2960,9,117,16,"Person 1","the newer ones maybe i doubt the older ones would like my house was built in the 70's before i was born i doubt it would hold up","p024","p001",1.6667,1,1.6667,3.3333
2961,9,117,17,"Person 2","man,i'd be freaked out...","p024","p001",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
2962,9,117,18,"Person 1","yeah but you cant stop nature","p024","p001",2,1.3333,2,1
2963,9,117,19,"Person 2","yea,i guess you just got to learn to live with them","p024","p001",2,1,2.6667,1.6667
2964,9,117,20,"Person 1","theres no earthquakes where you're from?","p024","p001",1,1,2.3333,1.3333
2965,9,117,21,"Person 2","i live in new york,there have been a few but I've never felt anything...they are usually way offshore and pretty small","p024","p001",1.6667,1,0.6667,2.6667

2971,9,117,27,"Person 2","Same to you! i learned some interesting things from the convo....bye!","p024","p001",2.3333,0,1,2.3333
2972,9,118,0,"Person 1","Where do these governments get the money to pay for damages this extensive?","p030","p050",1,1.6667,0.6667,1
2973,9,118,1,"Person 2","I have no idea...","p030","p050",0.6667,1.6667,0.6667,1.3333
2974,9,118,2,"Person 1","Neither do I. There were only two deaths involved in this article; so while I feel for those affected by both death and destruction of property, it doesn't hit as close to home as some of the other articles I have read.","p030","p050",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
2975,9,118,3,"Person 2","Yeah. Guess there was some sort of warnings. They kinda lucky when compared with less developed countries","p030","p050",1.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
2976,9,118,4,"Person 1","I don't know. It said the quake happened just after midnight, but being in the ring of fire probably prepares people for these kinds of events both in an infrastructural and psychological sense.","p030","p050",0.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
2977,9,118,5,"Person 2","Yea, Adrenalin sets in and they can take shelther","p030","p050",1,1.3333,2,2
2978,9,118,6,"Person 1","Have you ever personally experienced an earthquake?","p030","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
2979,9,118,7,"Person 2","No I havent","p030","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,2.3333
2980,9,118,8,"Person 1","Do you happen to know what year the earthquake we read about happened? I don't think it was mentioned.","p030","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1.6667
2981,9,118,9,"Person 2","I dont..I only skimmed it through","p030","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1.6667
2982,9,118,10,"Person 1","Hm, I wonder if the area has been restored to a functioning capacity. The article talked about dams be broken and billions of dollars of damage being done to roads and buildings.","p030","p050",0.6667,1,1,1.6667
2983,9,118,11,"Person 2","It wont be so easy to fix back...it would take years","p030","p050",0.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
2984,9,118,12,"Person 1","No kidding. Have you ever experienced any natural disaster first hand? Second hand?","p030","p050",0.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
2985,9,118,13,"Person 2","Only flooding...massive one","p030","p050",0.6667,1.6667,0.6667,2
2986,9,118,14,"Person 1","Was your family/property personally affected?","p030","p050",0.6667,1,1,1.6667
2987,9,118,15,"Person 2","My property was affected. We can exchange our bye","p030","p050",0.6667,1.6667,0.6667,2.6667
2988,9,118,16,"Person 1","bye","p030","p050",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
2989,9,119,0,"Person 1","This is so sad. I hate hearing about big earthquakes.","p038","p022",3,2,4,2
2990,9,119,1,"Person 2","tell me about it! There was one recently in California as well.","p038","p022",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
2991,9,119,2,"Person 1","That's right! There was 2 decent sized ones. I'm glad there wasn't the destruction that New Zealand got","p038","p022",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
2992,9,119,3,"Person 2","yea. I don't think anyone died so that's a good thing!","p038","p022",2.6667,0,3,1.6667
2993,9,119,4,"Person 1","That's definitely the best thing! They have months of rebuilding ahead of them","p038","p022",3,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
2994,9,119,5,"Person 2","True. I can't even imagine how a town like that would start to rebuild.","p038","p022",1.6667,1,4.3333,2
2995,9,119,6,"Person 1","I have no idea. All those homes lost. People must be heartbroken","p038","p022",3,2,3.6667,2
2996,9,119,7,"Person 2","Definitely. I am so glad i dont live in a state with earthquakes!","p038","p022",2.3333,0,1.6667,2.3333
2997,9,119,8,"Person 1","Same here. But we do get tornados I'm not sure one is any better lol","p038","p022",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
2998,9,119,9,"Person 2","Haha. Do you have any family in states with earthquakes?","p038","p022",1.6667,1,1,1
2999,9,119,10,"Person 1","I have some cousins in California but I don't talk to them. The rest of us are here in Tornado Central lol You?","p038","p022",1.3333,1.3333,1,3
3000,9,119,11,"Person 2","My friend lives over there. He said the earthquake lasted 40 seconds at least!","p038","p022",2,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
3001,9,119,12,"Person 1","Oh wow. That would terrify me. 40 seconds doesn't sound like a lot until you're in that kind of situation then it seems like forever","p038","p022",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
3002,9,119,13,"Person 2","Oh yeah, i always thought they lasted 3-5 seconds. Boy was i wrong","p038","p022",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
3003,9,119,14,"Person 1","yeah I guess my knowledge mostly comes from sitcoms where they have to shrink down a huge event into a span of a couple seconds lol","p038","p022",2,1,1.3333,2.3333
3004,9,119,15,"Person 2","I wish there was some way we could help those families affected by the earthquake. :(","p038","p022",3,1.3333,4.6667,2.3333
3005,9,119,16,"Person 1","I'm sure there's some fund or charity set up to donate to but I'm always so hesitant unless I know 100% of my money is going there","p038","p022",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
3006,9,119,17,"Person 2","That's true. Those charities can be very shady.","p038","p022",1.6667,1,3,2
3007,9,119,18,"Person 1","I have to do a lot of research before committing and it always seems like its the ones that are for reasons like this where they're like 50% for them and 50% for said charity. It so sad","p038","p022",2,1,3,2.3333
3008,9,119,19,"Person 2","Yeah, if i lived where the families were affected, i'd rather spend time volunteering somehow","p038","p022",1.6667,0.3333,3.3333,3
3009,9,119,20,"Person 1","Yeah I'd feel more like I was doing something to contribute","p038","p022",1.6667,0.3333,3.3333,2.3333
3010,9,119,21,"Person 2","Same! Well It was nice talking to you!","p038","p022",2,0,1,1
3011,9,119,22,"Person 1","Yes the same to you! bye","p038","p022",2,0,0.6667,1
3012,9,119,23,"Person 2","bye","p038","p022",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
3013,9,120,0,"Person 1","What a sad situation! I think earthquakes are one of the most frightening natural disasters personally.","p002","p009",3.3333,1.6667,4,2.3333
3014,9,120,1,"Person 2","They are so scary and the destruction is awful","p002","p009",2.3333,2,4.3333,2.3333
3015,9,120,2,"Person 1","The only ways to really combat them are through building standards I suppose. They hit so fast.","p002","p009",1.6667,0.6667,3.6667,1.3333
3016,9,120,3,"Person 2","yeah and even that sometimes isn't enough","p002","p009",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1
3017,9,120,4,"Person 1","And then the fact that they can trigger tsunamis and nuclear power plant leaks and such. Definitely little you can do to prepare.","p002","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
3018,9,120,5,"Person 2","I agree. they are very scary and devastating","p002","p009",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
3019,9,120,6,"Person 1","Kind of crappy that there are always people looking to loot and take advantage of those already at their lowest levels.","p002","p009",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
3020,9,120,7,"Person 2","yeah that is sad too, theres no excuse for that","p002","p009",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
3021,9,120,8,"Person 1","I kind of feel like people caught performing this should face steeper sentencing than normal theft crimes.","p002","p009",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
3022,9,120,9,"Person 2","i agree. but it is also inspiring to see communities come together and help each other after these terrible events happen","p002","p009",2.6667,0,3.3333,2.3333
3023,9,120,10,"Person 1","Yea, I guess you get to see both sides of the spectrum in situations like this. Great good and extreme bad. I wonder how long it is until we have better warning systems for earthquakes.","p002","p009",1.6667,0.6667,3,2
3024,9,120,11,"Person 2","im not sure, i dont know much about it. but hopefully eventually all new buildings will be reinforced to withstand them","p002","p009",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,1.6667
3025,9,120,12,"Person 1","I guess that would require a lot of the older infrastructure to be torn down or replaced bit by bit. It seems like more of these natural disasters are happening as of late though.","p002","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
3026,9,120,13,"Person 2","yes it does, but like you said - earthquakes are the most unpredictable and most destructive","p002","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1,1.6667
3027,9,120,14,"Person 1","Developing this tech should probably be of most importance. There has to be signs of plate movements within the earth before these hit.","p002","p009",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
3028,9,120,15,"Person 2","i agree, and im sure with time we will figure it out","p002","p009",1,0.3333,2,1.3333
3029,9,120,16,"Person 1","I'm thankful that I do not live in the Ring of Fire area. This has to be doubly stressful as you have to worry about volcanoes and earthquakes.","p002","p009",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
3030,9,120,17,"Person 2","volcanoes would be horrifying too, i hope the one in yellowstone doesn't erupt","p002","p009",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
3031,9,120,18,"Person 1","Right! I remember reading an article that there are 15+ active volcanoes in the US. I can't remember the last time one of them erupted besides the eruptions in Hawaii. I doubt we are prepared for this disaster since we rarely experience them.","p002","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
3032,9,120,19,"Person 2","i dont think most people even ever think about it","p002","p009",1.3333,1,3,1.3333
3033,9,120,20,"Person 1","The last major volcano eruption was Mount St. Helens so I guess people have little reason to remember. The history channel does a good job of fear mongering super volcanoes though!","p002","p009",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
3034,9,120,21,"Person 2","they definitely scare me, lol. it was nice talking to you, have a great day! goodbye","p002","p009",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,2
3035,9,120,22,"Person 1","you as well :) bys","p002","p009",1.6667,0,0.6667,1
3036,9,120,23,"Person 2","i believe you have to say bye, thank you goodbye","p002","p009",0.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1
3037,9,120,24,"Person 1","bye","p002","p009",0.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
3038,9,120,25,"Person 2","7","p002","p009",0,1,0,1
3039,9,120,26,"Person 1","goodbye","p002","p009",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
3040,6,121,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the article?","p022","p007",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
3041,6,121,1,"Person 2","I think it is a greatidea to host an exhibit to try and educate people on what these migrants have to go through. It saddens me though that people have to go through struggles like this and drop everything though just to escape with their lives to a better place.","p022","p007",3.6667,1,3.6667,3
3042,6,121,2,"Person 1","I agree it's terrible. Do you think you can really teach empathy though?","p022","p007",3.6667,1.6667,3,2
3043,6,121,3,"Person 2","Hmm I'm not sure. You can teach/mimic the feelings that these people got hrough; but that doesn't mean for certain that someone will still feel empathy towards them.","p022","p007",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
3044,6,121,4,"Person 1","I agree. I think it doesn't matter how much you teach someone empathy, if they were born with no empathy.. i'm not sure if these classes will change them.","p022","p007",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3045,6,121,5,"Person 2","Yea some people just do not care about their fellow man no matter what. It is still good though to expose the general populous to the lives of these people though; Some education never hurts.","p022","p007",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
3046,6,121,6,"Person 1","I agree. What do you think about allowing some of thse people in the US?","p022","p007",1,1,2,1.6667
3047,6,121,7,"Person 2","Well first of all I think we need to reform the official immigration process. It is a lot of red tape and waiting etc. That's why people just try to sneak in all the time. But as long as they are productive members of society I see no problem with immigration.","p022","p007",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,3
3048,6,121,8,"Person 1","It's pretty sad watching the news and seeing all these families being separated. :(","p022","p007",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
3049,6,121,9,"Person 2","Yea it really is. Totally messed up. I can't imagine how traumatic that is for a child, let alone their parents.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,4,2.3333
3050,6,121,10,"Person 1","Yeah, the conditions they're keeping these children in when detained.. terrible","p022","p007",3.6667,2,4,2
3051,6,121,11,"Person 2","It's just really messed up when you start treating actual people like less than human.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
3052,6,121,12,"Person 1","Seriously, we have no right to treat others that way. These people are still human at the end of the day.","p022","p007",3,2,4,2.3333
3053,6,121,13,"Person 2","Exactly. These are real people, just like us. But of course our president doesn't see that all he sees are colours in his crayon box that he doesn't like.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,4,2.3333
3054,6,121,14,"Person 1","Let's hope the future changes for the better. So you do think that we should have a class that specifically teaches empathy?","p022","p007",2.6667,0.6667,3,1.6667
3055,6,121,15,"Person 2","Well again I don't think you can teach empathy; but just educate people on the experiences and feelings of others.","p022","p007",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
3056,6,121,16,"Person 1","That's a good idea. Nothing wrong with putting the good out there.","p022","p007",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
3057,6,121,17,"Person 2","Yea like I said earlier, a little education never hurts. Not everyone will give a damn but the decent people will.","p022","p007",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
3058,6,121,18,"Person 1","I wonder if there's anyway we can help these immigrants","p022","p007",2.6667,0,3,2
3059,6,121,19,"Person 2","Well a better immigration policy would probably help. If they could go through the official process easier they wouldn't have to sneak in and risk their lives.","p022","p007",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
3060,6,121,20,"Person 1","Let's hope our next president looks more into this issue. Well it was nice talking to you!","p022","p007",2,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3061,6,121,21,"Person 2","Yes lets hope. And likewise! Have a great rest of the workday fellow turker :)","p022","p007",2,0,2,1.6667
3062,6,121,22,"Person 1","bye","p022","p007",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
3063,6,121,23,"Person 2","goodbye!","p022","p007",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
3064,6,122,0,"Person 1","That was depressing to read.","p024","p029",4,2,4.3333,2.3333
3065,6,122,1,"Person 2","Yeah it was pretty sad I thought","p024","p029",3,2,4.3333,2.3333
3066,6,122,2,"Person 1","Whats your opinion about it?","p024","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
3067,6,122,3,"Person 2","It especially made me sad to hear about the children who were affected but the people who were adults too.  It is kinda hard to relate to but I hate that anyone has to go through that and it makes me very grateful to be an American.  How about you?","p024","p029",3.6667,2,4.3333,3.3333
3068,6,122,4,"Person 1","you're right I can't relate to it either it is probably a good thing","p024","p029",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
3069,6,122,5,"Person 2","yes for sure.  I can't imagine having to flee my country","p024","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
3070,6,122,6,"Person 1","would you flee as well if you were facing what they go through at home?","p024","p029",2,1,3.3333,1.6667
3071,6,122,7,"Person 2","I guess it would just depend on the situation.  If I thought my childrens' lives were in danger I would do whatever I had to to protect them.  What about you","p024","p029",2,1.3333,3.6667,3.3333
3072,6,122,8,"Person 1","Same here, which is why I don't understand when people tell them to fight at home and risk their kids lives.","p024","p029",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
3073,6,122,9,"Person 2","yes I could never do that and wouldnt expect others to","p024","p029",2.6667,1,3,2.6667
3074,6,122,10,"Person 1","what do you think can be done to solve this problem?","p024","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
3075,6,122,11,"Person 2","Not to sound pessimistic but I'm not sure these is much that can be done.  IT seems certain areas/countries have had ongoing conflict for hundreds of years and resolving that is a tremendous undertaking.  What do you think can be done?","p024","p029",2.3333,2,3.6667,2
3076,6,122,12,"Person 1","I think nothing can be done to be honest its a lost cause and that hurts to say but I don't see a solution at all.","p024","p029",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
3077,6,122,13,"Person 2","yes I don't either.  It's just sad for the innocents who fall victim to it.","p024","p029",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
3078,6,122,14,"Person 1","we are quite lucky to have not been born there.","p024","p029",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3079,6,122,15,"Person 2","Yes extremely lucky, I feel grateful every day for being here and sometimes think about how different things could be in a bad way if I had been born somewhere else.  It's easy to take it for granted so reading things like that is a good reminder.","p024","p029",3,0,2.6667,3.3333
3080,6,122,16,"Person 1","yeah just waking up every morning having running water and toothpaste is a blessing and we never think of it as anything special. other people dont know any of that.","p024","p029",3,0,3,3
3081,6,122,17,"Person 2","Yes you are right!!  Those things are so easy to take for granted.  And not having to fear for our safety or our family's safety every day","p024","p029",3.3333,0,3.6667,3
3082,6,122,18,"Person 1","yeah man its amazing how those little things are so overlooked","p024","p029",3,0,3,2
3083,6,122,19,"Person 2","yeah I guess we can take the opportunity to feel grateful for the little things today.","p024","p029",2.3333,0,2.6667,2
3084,6,122,20,"Person 1","I hope things get better in those countries though.","p024","p029",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3085,6,122,21,"Person 2","Yeah me too.  It seems like it's just ongoing in some places like continuously no matter what.  It is sad.","p024","p029",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
3086,6,122,22,"Person 1","Its been a good talk friend. I agreed with you on everything. goodbye","p024","p029",1.3333,0,1,2
3087,6,122,23,"Person 2","You too, hope you have a great day.  goodbye","p024","p029",1,0,0.6667,1.3333
3088,6,123,0,"Person 1","Tell me how you feel about the situation?","p005","p059",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
3089,6,123,1,"Person 2","I thought the article was very thought provoking and in line with things I felt already, that empathy is severely lacking in society in general. People are too dismissive of those suffering and assume they made choices to put themselves in that situation.","p005","p059",3,1.3333,4,2.6667
3090,6,123,2,"Person 1","You nailed it honestly","p005","p059",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
3091,6,123,3,"Person 2","What did you think about the scenario at the beginning of the article about \"training\" people to have more empathy through scenarios, do you think that would work?","p005","p059",1,1,1.3333,1
3092,6,123,4,"Person 1","I think that would go a long way as well","p005","p059",2.3333,0.3333,2,2.3333
3093,6,123,5,"Person 2","I do wonder how well it would work for the people who need it most, like how easy it would be for them to compartmentalize that it's not real or not. Or whether people like that would even try scenarios, outside of school or some place where they had to.","p005","p059",2,1,3,2
3094,6,123,6,"Person 1","I think there should be more awareness to teach people how to show genuine empathy","p005","p059",2,0.6667,3.3333,2.3333
3095,6,123,7,"Person 2","Yeah for sure. I think schools would probably be the best place to start, or continue anyway, since kids are less set in their ways","p005","p059",2.3333,0.6667,3,2.3333
3096,6,123,8,"Person 1","Yes, also need to do this now so the generations to come do not face this sad situation.","p005","p059",2.6667,1.3333,3,2
3097,6,123,9,"Person 2","Right. I think additional media campaigns as well that show the human face of conflicts, natural disasters etc, as well are important, so that people can't hide away from it as much","p005","p059",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
3098,6,123,10,"Person 1","It is just really terrible?","p005","p059",2.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
3099,6,123,11,"Person 2","I think a lot of it is just ignorance or how easy it is to ignore stuff rather than willful maliciousness but I'm not sure","p005","p059",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3100,6,123,12,"Person 1","What do you think is best corrective measure to stop this?","p005","p059",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
3101,6,123,13,"Person 2","Probably like I said, school campaigns and media campaigns. I feel like something to do with social connections, charity, community building etc should be a class in school","p005","p059",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
3102,6,123,14,"Person 1","I agree with that, do you think that is enough?","p005","p059",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
3103,6,123,15,"Person 2","Probably not, but it's a start. I also do think politicians need to show more leadership in leading the charge even if their constituents don't all agree right away. Politicians are elected to be leaders not followers.","p005","p059",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
3104,6,123,16,"Person 1","I also think there should be adequate punishment for whoever violates the rule","p005","p059",2,1.3333,3,2.6667
3105,6,123,17,"Person 2","Not sure how people can be punished for lack of empathy, it would depend on the situation I suppose. But people should definitely call out others more for lack of caring.","p005","p059",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
3106,6,123,18,"Person 1","Well, at the end i really hope we all do the right thing.....goodbye","p005","p059",1.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.6667
3107,6,123,19,"Person 2","I agree with that. Best wishes. goodbye","p005","p059",0.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3108,6,124,0,"Person 1","The refugee problem seems like it's getting worse.  We like to think the world is getting more civilized, but I guess not.","p062","p030",3,2,3,1.6667
3109,6,124,1,"Person 2","In desperate circumstances the basest of man's desires will come to bare. Refugee's are easily exploited and potentially inordinately profitable. I think the reason why a lot of these problems are not being solved is because there are large groups of people who don't want them to be.","p062","p030",3,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
3110,6,124,2,"Person 1","I'm sure.  History appears to change but, as you say, man's instincts remain the same.  I think all the time, not just in desperate circumstances.","p062","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
3111,6,124,3,"Person 2","I worded that improperly. I meant, when people can be easily manipulated and exploited there will undoubtedly be someone willing to do it for personal gain. Like, the so called crisis at our southern border. There are thousands of desperate people being forced into what amount to for-profit prisons funded by tax payer money. Do you think the people running those prisons want to rectify the issue with immigration? Of course not.","p062","p030",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
3112,6,124,4,"Person 1","I understood your point.  I just didn't really care.  Like I don't care about the refugees.","p062","p030",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,3
3113,6,124,5,"Person 2","Do go on.","p062","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
3114,6,124,6,"Person 1","The world is too large to make individual problems global problems, and global problems individual problems.  The math doesn't work.","p062","p030",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
3115,6,124,7,"Person 2","The refugee crisis IS a global problem. Are you suggesting that we just ignore it?","p062","p030",3.3333,2,4,2
3116,6,124,8,"Person 1","Yes, I'm suggesting that I not make the problems of other individual people to be my problem.  They can create a country that's not a hellhole they have to flee from.  Somehow many countries have accomplished that.","p062","p030",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3117,6,124,9,"Person 2","These \"hellholes\" are people's homes that they don't want to leave. They've most usually been upended by US influence. These aren't just the problems of individual people, these are the problems of whole nations of people. You can only turn a blind eye for so long before that problem comes knocking on your door.","p062","p030",4,2,3.6667,2
3118,6,124,10,"Person 1","I disagree with most of that.  And we certainly don't have to answer the door.","p062","p030",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
3119,6,124,11,"Person 2","Pray explain. The door can always be kicked in.","p062","p030",2.6667,1.3333,2,2
3120,6,124,12,"Person 1","We could shoot these people at the border.  Maybe they'd reconsider fleeing and put up a fight in their own hellhole country.","p062","p030",4.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
3121,6,124,13,"Person 2","So, you'd prefer ethnic cleansing over immigration reform? Also, you know that most undocumented immigrants don't come through the southern border, right?","p062","p030",4.3333,2,3,2.3333
3122,6,124,14,"Person 1","Your solution is to deal with the symptom, not the true disease.  You let countries get infested at the top and become unlivable, and everyone--Africans, Middle Easterners, Asians, and Hispanics--flee into civilized countries.  That's not a long term solution.","p062","p030",3.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
3123,6,124,15,"Person 2","What do you consider the true disease?","p062","p030",2.3333,1,0.6667,1
3124,6,124,16,"Person 1","Allowing dictators and corruption to lead other countries.  As far as I'm concerned the same people who flee their oppression are responsible for it.  They are responsible for their own leadership which they feel forced to flee.  I see no reason why they should piggyback off of our ability to live semi-harmoniously and threaten that.","p062","p030",4,1.6667,1,2.6667
3125,6,124,17,"Person 2","You do realize that the US often backs and installs the despotic governments that contravene the public's wishes and interests in these countries to further their own agenda? The resulting turmoil has our governments fingerprints all over it, so that try as they might to elect leaders that work for them they are headed off at every turn by international interest. You're claiming we have no responsibility to these people. I don't believe that.","p062","p030",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
3126,6,124,18,"Person 1","Well, believe what you want, it doesn't change reality.  I do have no responsibility to them.  They have responsibility to themselves.  And the influence the US has in these places is grossly overblown.  Either way these are brown-skinned savages.  Subhumans.","p062","p030",4.6667,1.6667,1.3333,3
3127,6,124,19,"Person 2","You really think that?","p062","p030",2.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
3128,6,124,20,"Person 1","Yes.  I do.  These people have had 10,000 years to become civilized.  They haven't.  Look at Africa.  It's a joke. EVERYTHING they have of modern culture is from empirialism.  Anyway, enlightening chat.  Thanks for having it with me.  bye","p062","p030",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
3129,6,124,21,"Person 2","I think that your behavior is quite uncivilized. Honestly, It's hard not to think you're a plant from the researcher to elicit a specific type of argument. Keep working on being a good person! bye","p062","p030",3.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
3130,6,125,0,"Person 1","It is so sad...we really need more empathy for refugees.","p050","p057",3,2,4.3333,2.3333
3131,6,125,1,"Person 2","I was wondering what exactly we could do for them?","p050","p057",1.6667,1,3.3333,1.6667
3132,6,125,2,"Person 1","I really dont know...Maybe donations","p050","p057",1.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
3133,6,125,3,"Person 2","Essentially thats like a band aid isn't it? This problem has to be attacked at the source","p050","p057",1.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
3134,6,125,4,"Person 1","Exactly..the social unrest here and there","p050","p057",0.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
3135,6,125,5,"Person 2","I thought the mock home evacuation thing they did was pointless also. You can really pretend you are a refugee while you are in the safety of America","p050","p057",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
3136,6,125,6,"Person 1","You have a good point with that.  People can easily pretend","p050","p057",0.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
3137,6,125,7,"Person 2","Also Ive notice the places the article mentioned like Somalia and Afghanistan have been war torn for the last decade","p050","p057",0.6667,1.6667,3,1.3333
3138,6,125,8,"Person 1","that is correct..You cant take that away from those regions, lol. They love war","p050","p057",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667

3179,314,127,14,"Person 1","Hmm.. Not sure. Like I know plenty of responsible younger people who drive safe; and Plenty of older people who drive safe.

3204,314,128,8,"Person 1","It was honestly","p005","p062",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
3205,314,128,9,"Person 2","I imagine the family members in this situation are saying a lot of \"what ifs.\"  These people were even visiting from another country.","p005","p062",2.6667,2,4,2

3208,314,128,12,"Person 1","What do you think can be done to prevent such occurrence?","p005","p062",2,1,1,1
3209,314,128,13,"Person 2","I think limiting immigration and brown-faced people from entering the country would help.  Did you notice that the person who caused the accident had a hispanic name, and of course the deceased were hispanic too.","p005","p062",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
3210,314,128,14,"Person 1","I do not think that is good idea","p005","p062",3.6667,2,1,2.3333

3221,314,129,3,"Person 2","I mean, besides driver's education and proper posted traffic warnings the only real way is for there to be a larger push for viable mass transportation.","p024","p030",0.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
3222,314,129,4,"Person 1","yeah man we need some other better forms of transportation its 2019","p024","p030",1,1,2,2
3223,314,129,5,"Person 2","Self driving cars will be beyond the means of the average American for another generation at least.

3228,314,129,10,"Person 1","Definitely, you never know who is drunk driving or just a terrible driver. The worst drivers are around my area definitely","p024","p030",1.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3229,314,129,11,"Person 2","It's a risk that every motorist takes, and our country was constructed so that in most places an automobile/driver's license/auto insurance are a necessity. I empathize with the victims in the article, but unfortunately it's a reality that we have to deal with as a society.","p024","p030",1.6667,1,3.3333,3
3230,314,129,12,"Person 1","Yes, but we should't take it as something normal. Death is not a normal thing and the quicker self driving cars become frequent the better in my opinion.","p024","p030",2,1.6667,3,3

3235,314,129,17,"Person 2","Can is one thing, willingness is a totally different monster. I think that high speed rail between metro areas is a viable option that would have manifold benefits. More progressive city planning is also a key investment to a future with less reliance on automobiles and gasoline.

3239,314,130,0,"Person 1","Hey, I can't even imagine what that father was feeling after hearing about that accident...","p043","p057",3.6667,2,4.6667,2.3333
3240,314,130,1,"Person 2","I felt the same way. I wonder if he will ever recover.","p043","p057",3.6667,2,4.3333,2
3241,314,130,2,"Person 1","If he ever does, it will take years. I can't even imagine hearing about such an accident. In mere moments, half your family is wiped away.","p043","p057",4.3333,2,4,2
3242,314,130,3,"Person 2","Do you think the other driver in the golf was street racing? It seemed like they were assuming he was","p043","p057",2.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
3243,314,130,4,"Person 1","It's hard to tell, wouldn't the evidence be overwhelmingly obvious?","p043","p057",2.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1.6667
3244,314,130,5,"Person 2","Yeah I guess I am always wondering about how situations like these can be avoided.","p043","p057",2.3333,1,0.6667,1.6667
3245,314,130,6,"Person 1","I guess by not driving recklessly and paying attention while you're driving. If it had been street racing, I'm assuming the racing car would've been going really fast and that would've affected the accident.","p043","p057",2.3333,1.6667,0.6667,2
3246,314,130,7,"Person 2","Yeah for everyone to die in both cars, the other car must have been going extremely fast. It just sucks that you can be like the Mother in this case, make no mistakes and still die.","p043","p057",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
3247,314,130,8,"Person 1","Wasn't there one or two survivors in the van? And depending on how the van was (lacking safety features), you could probably die after an accident while going 60 mph.","p043","p057",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
3248,314,130,9,"Person 2","I believe they all died. The mother the two younger children and the teenager. The other two definitely died in the VW. Sure I guess You could die in an accident going 60 mph. However I've been in one of those and walked away without a scratch. I dont think that could have been the case in this one","p043","p057",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,3
3249,314,130,10,"Person 1","I think I read that a relative survived the crash, I could've been mistaken. Anyway, I think it probably wasn't street racing. Police are used to estimating speeds due to skid marks and the damages to the vehicles. Although it's possible that the VW was flooring it and lost control before going that fast. And I've found that accidents are semi random and the damage to you has more to do with how you react (less damage if you didn't react). I hit a huge buck at 50 mph or so and completely totaled my car but didn't have a scratch on me. I've been in a minor accident as a passenger and I didn't feel good for a couple days.","p043","p057",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
3250,314,130,11,"Person 2","Youre right actually Two people out of the five in the van survived, which is everyone except his wife and two children. That's so horrible. I think head on collisions are worse also because the cars are moving in the opposite direction which increasing the impact.","p043","p057",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3251,314,130,12,"Person 1","Do you think the survivors felt guilty at all? It's such a unique circumstance. And yeah, head on collisions are the worst.","p043","p057",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2
3252,314,130,13,"Person 2","I think the Husband felt guilty, maybe that he wasn't there or wasn't the one driving. I don't think the survivors felt guilty, probably just lucky that they were in the right seat.","p043","p057",2.3333,1,4.3333,2.3333
3253,314,130,14,"Person 1","I don't know...if I was in that circumstance, I would probably keep asking myself why this happened. Why didn't I ask if we could leave later or drive to a different location instead? There would be a million what if questions in my head. And why was I spared?","p043","p057",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
3254,314,130,15,"Person 2","Would you feel guilty though? Would you ask why them and not you?","p043","p057",2.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
3255,314,130,16,"Person 1","Yeah, basically. I haven't actually been in the situation so maybe there wouldn't be any guilt. From watching movies though, whenever this kind of thing happens, the main character always wishes that they somehow delayed the person who ended up killed. And if they had managed to do so, then the beloved person would still be alive.","p043","p057",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3256,314,130,17,"Person 2","Yeah I could see that. I would just be depressed and feel so fragile because I just saw two people die and the only difference was probably a feet or two between us.","p043","p057",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
3257,314,130,18,"Person 1","They say football is a game of inches and life is an even better example. I hope that family was able to heal after this devastating accident. It was nice talking to you, have a good day.","p043","p057",3,0.3333,2.3333,2
3258,314,130,19,"Person 2","That is a good quote and it was nice talking to you. goodbye","p043","p057",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333

3261,73,131,1,"Person 2","I think its incredibly weird they wore vials of each others blood around their necks lol","p005","p038",3.3333,2,1,2.6667
3262,73,131,2,"Person 1","I was shocked about it though","p005","p038",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
3263,73,131,3,"Person 2","She is really weird to me. I don't know what it is but I think she's just a tad creepy.","p005","p038",2.6667,2,2,2.6667
3264,73,131,4,"Person 1","You really think so?","p005","p038",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
3265,73,131,5,"Person 2","yes but maybe I'm just biased because I was very pro brad and jennifer lol","p005","p038",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,3
3266,73,131,6,"Person 1","HAHA.... That explains your chat then","p005","p038",2,0.3333,1,1.3333
3267,73,131,7,"Person 2","I just never understood why he'd leave her for Angelina, but what do I know lol I wonder if there's a chance Angelina and Billy Bob might reconcile now","p005","p038",2,1,2.6667,2.6667
3268,73,131,8,"Person 1","I do not see that happening honestly","p005","p038",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.3333
3269,73,131,9,"Person 2","probably not. I'm not sure whatever happened to him. Do you think Brad was really abusive towards their children like the article mentioned?","p005","p038",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
3270,73,131,10,"Person 1","I'm trying not to believe that is true","p005","p038",2,1.3333,1.3333,2
3271,73,131,11,"Person 2","I think she might have just been trying to get him some bad publicity or something he always seemed like a good dad to me but who knows what goes on behind closed doors","p005","p038",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
3272,73,131,12,"Person 1","I really hope that is not true because i kind of respect him","p005","p038",3,0.6667,3,2.3333
3273,73,131,13,"Person 2","Yeah he seems decent. I always liked him maybe they were just really toxic together.","p005","p038",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
3274,73,131,14,"Person 1","Do you genuinely think they can be back together?","p005","p038",0.3333,1,2,1
3275,73,131,15,"Person 2","I think anything is possible. I guess it depends on how their relationship was before and if they can forgive and move on. But I kinda see her going towards a younger man now.","p005","p038",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
3276,73,131,16,"Person 1","Well, I hope they really. I like them together","p005","p038",2.6667,0.3333,1,2
3277,73,131,17,"Person 2","Wonder what they reasoning for the vials of blood was? lol","p005","p038",2,1,1,1.3333

3280,73,132,0,"Person 1","I'm sorry his marriage did not work out.","p035","p022",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
3281,73,132,1,"Person 2","It was terrible. I felt a bit bad for him but not really because he's rich.","p035","p022",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
3282,73,132,2,"Person 1","Money is not always happiness, but I would like to be rich.","p035","p022",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,3
3283,73,132,3,"Person 2","That's true. Are you a fan of Billy BOb Thornton or Angelina Jolie?","p035","p022",1.3333,0.6667,2,1
3284,73,132,4,"Person 1","Not really, You?","p035","p022",1.3333,1,1,2

3286,73,132,6,"Person 1","They are okay actor and actress","p035","p022",1.3333,0.3333,1,2
3287,73,132,7,"Person 2","Do you think Angelina Jolie deserves to keep the children?","p035","p022",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
3288,73,132,8,"Person 1","Besides from what I just read I do not know the details, so I guess so.","p035","p022",1.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2
3289,73,132,9,"Person 2","Do you know any single mothers or parents in general?","p035","p022",1,1,1,1
3290,73,132,10,"Person 1","I know single mothers and I'm a parent. How about you?","p035","p022",1.3333,1,1,3.3333
3291,73,132,11,"Person 2","I'm not a parent yet. Since you're a parent, how would you feel if you were a single parent?","p035","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,2.3333
3292,73,132,12,"Person 1","It would be hard. It is hard with both parents in the house.","p035","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
3293,73,132,13,"Person 2","That's true. It's just tough for children to grow up with 1 parent in my opinion.","p035","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
3294,73,132,14,"Person 1","My mother did a good job with me and my siblings.","p035","p022",3,0,2,3.6667

3297,73,132,17,"Person 2","I don't think it's necessary to be honest. You do this big wedding and now you say you're married. Ok now what? It's the smae as being bf/gf.","p035","p022",2.3333,1,1,3.3333
3298,73,132,18,"Person 1","I got married at the court house 18 years ago.","p035","p022",2.3333,0.6667,1,3.6667
3299,73,132,19,"Person 2","I'm still not married yet at the age of 32. Am i too old?","p035","p022",2.3333,0.6667,1,3.6667

3305,73,133,2,"Person 1","That Jolie wore when they were with billy bob. Thats kinda creepy, wearing eachother's blood in a necklace.","p007","p050",3,2,3,2.6667

3314,73,133,11,"Person 2","I cant dwell in such. I profile people up before even getting close","p007","p050",1.6667,1.3333,3,3
3315,73,133,12,"Person 1","Yea that is what I do now. Made that mistake once never going to happen again haha.","p007","p050",2,1.3333,2.3333,3

3326,73,134,0,"Person 1","this happens a lot in relationships it seems","p024","p063",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
3327,73,134,1,"Person 2","what does? breakups?","p024","p063",1.6667,1,1,1
3328,73,134,2,"Person 1","when someone does not feel good enough for the other","p024","p063",2,1,3.3333,1
3329,73,134,3,"Person 2","Oh right.  I feel like Billy should haev expected that seeing as how he married a gorgous movie star who was 20 years younger than him.","p024","p063",2.3333,1,3.3333,2.3333
3330,73,134,4,"Person 1","What do you think should be the maximum age difference between couples?","p024","p063",0.6667,1,2,1
3331,73,134,5,"Person 2","Lol I'm assuming you don't mean legally, although there probably should be... but my parents were 12 years apart, and that was kind of pushing it.  I feel like normal people shouldn't exceed 15 years.  You?","p024","p063",2,1,3,3.6667
3332,73,134,6,"Person 1","Around 12-13 years I'm thinking. Anything more is too much.","p024","p063",1.6667,1,2,2
3333,73,134,7,"Person 2","Yeah, there's just too many cultural obstacles to overcome, not to mention the difference in life stages.  My dad is retired, while my mom still has to work, it's kind of making things difficult.","p024","p063",2,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
3334,73,134,8,"Person 1","Well your parents are only 12 years apart it isn't that much compared to this guy who was 20 years apart from her that was too different from each other.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
3335,73,134,9,"Person 2","Yeah.  Thing is though, I'm sure the majority of marriages in hollywood are done for almost purely professional reasons anyway..  I don't think these people actuallllyyy love each other .","p024","p063",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3336,73,134,10,"Person 1","Now that I think about my sister is married to someone about 10 years apart from her I guess it is normal nowadays lol.","p024","p063",2,1,2.6667,3
3337,73,134,11,"Person 2","Yeah that's doable, but anything more is still getting weird.  What do you think about the blood vial thing?","p024","p063",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
3338,73,134,12,"Person 1","you mean when they wore the blood of each other around their necks? that was some intense stuff to read. I don't know what to think of that, just weird.","p024","p063",3.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
3339,73,134,13,"Person 2","Yeah I just find that to be a publicity stunt.  Keeps their names in the news.","p024","p063",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
3340,73,134,14,"Person 1","hollywood people are just weird, there are a lot of weirdos in that business.","p024","p063",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
3341,73,134,15,"Person 2","Yeah.  Do you think they're strange so they got into hollywood? Or are they strange because they got into hollywood?","p024","p063",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1
3342,73,134,16,"Person 1","It's a little bit of both. I'm pretty su re there a lot of pedophiles in hollywood as well, a secret ring. It's just not a place you'd want to be at.","p024","p063",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.6667
3343,73,134,17,"Person 2","Lol yeah you're probably right.  I'm sure there's a lot of Weinsteins, but concentrated on kids.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
3344,73,134,18,"Person 1","Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the rumors about that were true.","p024","p063",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
3345,73,134,19,"Person 2","You probably just end up getting into crazy stuff because of their schedule, and ability to form meaningful relationships with other people.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.3333
3346,73,134,20,"Person 1","imagine what the hollywood actors that start from childhood. Those are the ones that end up the worst.  Just look at all the stories of childhood stars and how they end up.","p024","p063",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
3347,73,134,21,"Person 2","Yeah you're really screwing with a kids brain when you put them in the limelight that early.  Not to bring basketball into it, but that's why I always appreciated Lebron James.   A star at an early age, yet he turned out to be a pretty stand up guy.","p024","p063",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
3348,73,134,22,"Person 1","Thats true or someone like Kobe Bryant who came out of High School as well.","p024","p063",2,0,2.6667,1.6667
3349,73,134,23,"Person 2","Yeah.  Thing is though, Lebron was a star at 13, and he's been faithfully married (as far as we know) to the same girl since like 20.  Can't say the same about Kobe.","p024","p063",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
3350,73,134,24,"Person 1","Kobe unfortunately will always be the better player and have had the better career but I see what you mean about Lebron.","p024","p063",2.3333,1,2,1.6667
3351,73,134,25,"Person 2","LOL WE HAVE AN EXTREME DISAGREEMENT NOW!","p024","p063",4,2,2,2.3333
3352,73,134,26,"Person 1","I'm a Laker fan and can't accept Lebron as the better player sorry.","p024","p063",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
3353,73,134,27,"Person 2","He is far and away the better player.  Kobe is a volume shooter, and good defender, but Lebron is sooo much more efficient with the ball on offense, and his defense is clearly better than Kobe.","p024","p063",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3354,73,134,28,"Person 1","Game on the line , NBA finals, last shot to win the game, you choose Kobe plain and simple. The Black Mamba is the closest thing we ever saw to MJ.","p024","p063",3,1,1.6667,2.3333
3355,73,134,29,"Person 2","He was like a poor mans MJ.  Lebron however is a completely different player.  Unfortunately for Kobe too, the game isn't just decided in the last shot, it's decided by the other 100 before it as well.","p024","p063",3,1,2,2
3356,73,134,30,"Person 1","It's something we will never agree on lol. It was the best talk I ever had in one of these hits though thanks man!! Definitely wish you the best. goodbye","p024","p063",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
3357,73,134,31,"Person 2","Lol same here! goodbye","p024","p063",1.3333,0,0.6667,1.6667
3358,73,135,0,"Person 1","Hello. How are you doing? Interesting article right?","p048","p010",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1.6667
3359,73,135,1,"Person 2","Hi!   I am doing well!  Thanks for asking.   It was an interesting article.   What are your thoughts?","p048","p010",1,0.3333,1,2
3360,73,135,2,"Person 1","You know, I rarely follow celebrity news at all so I actually learned a thing or two today!","p048","p010",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,3
3361,73,135,3,"Person 2","That's me :)   I just saw even with success and notoriety - there are those that can't find peace.  He felt he wasn't good enough.","p048","p010",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,3
3362,73,135,4,"Person 1","Yes. And I mean I wouldn't blame the guy. Especially being 20 years older than her. Not exactly an easy age gap.","p048","p010",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3363,73,135,5,"Person 2","No it isn't.   Her world was crazy and she liked it - His world was quiet, reserved, and didn't like partying with the reach.    It \"appeared\" they had nothing in common at all","p048","p010",3,0.6667,3.3333,2
3364,73,135,6,"Person 1","Very much so. The divorce rate with celebrities is outrageous because of their lifestyle. I always like to hear about celebs who've been married for 15+ years. It's so rare.","p048","p010",2.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
3365,73,135,7,"Person 2","I know and it's folks you would not think about making it that long.   Jolie seems to go after men in movies they are together so she shouldn't be married in my opinion","p048","p010",2,1.6667,4.3333,2.3333
3366,73,135,8,"Person 1","Exactly. I guess it would be difficult to be an actress and not feel like your own life is a movie, you know? Almost like they aren't in touch with reality.","p048","p010",2.3333,1,3,1.6667
3367,73,135,9,"Person 2","They aren't - a few are - Newman gives back - Bullock gives back etc.  Most just want to show off fancy houses, cars, etc.   1 in 5 kids are hungry - how much money does one need?","p048","p010",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
3368,73,135,10,"Person 1","There definitely a few who give more back and with the right intentions. Then there are those who just give back so they can look better. I could never imagine that life but honestly wouldn't want my whole life to be exploited either.","p048","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3
3369,73,135,11,"Person 2","Me either.  All the young people nowadays have every waking moment documented.  It will haunt them at some point","p048","p010",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
3370,73,135,12,"Person 1","100%. I'm such a believer that what is put out on the internet can be seen by literally anyone and everyone. It's so not safe and is easily used against you. I get documenting it but not posting it online for 100+ people to have access to.","p048","p010",3.6667,1.3333,2,3
3371,73,135,13,"Person 2","And all the selfies.  How many photos do you want of yourself?  I don't get wanting to photos of yourself at all.   It's a disturbing behavior.","p048","p010",4,2,2.3333,3
3372,73,135,14,"Person 1","It makes me cringe. I just don't understand it and it's creating such self-centered humans.","p048","p010",3.3333,2,3,3
3373,73,135,15,"Person 2","It just continues the downhill path of me, me, me.  It needs to get back to we, we, we.","p048","p010",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3374,73,135,16,"Person 1","Exactly but I unfortunately don't think that it will be reversed any time soon. It's only gotten worse so who knows where it will lead.","p048","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
3375,73,135,17,"Person 2","It's all these electronic devices that we don't need.  It has made life more complicated that it needs it to be.   On a side note, when you take these hits, what are all the emotions based on - it never says.    Does it mean how I am feeling generally or how the story made me feel?","p048","p010",3,1,3,2.6667
3376,73,135,18,"Person 1","I believe it's how the story made you feel. I think that's how I generally answer! Usually they are actually like sad stories or emotional stories but I think this is the first one I've read that wasn't \"sad\"","p048","p010",2,0.6667,3,2
3377,73,135,19,"Person 2","Me too.  It's a refreshing change.   I can't thank you enough for chatting today.  Blessings to you and yours.   goodbye","p048","p010",1.6667,0,2.6667,2.3333
3378,73,135,20,"Person 1","Thanks! goodbye","p048","p010",1.6667,0,0.3333,1.3333
3379,99,136,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the situation with the divorce?","p022","p030",1,0.6667,1,1
3380,99,136,1,"Person 2","I think divorce can be a healthy or a hurtful thing depending on the people involved. TMZ seemed to take a lighthearted approach to it. What do you think?","p022","p030",2,0.6667,2,2.3333
3381,99,136,2,"Person 1","I think the same although i do feel bad for Dakota and Elle","p022","p030",2.3333,1.6667,3,2
3382,99,136,3,"Person 2","I'm actually not familiar with these people at all. What are they famous for?","p022","p030",1,0.6667,1,1.6667
3383,99,136,4,"Person 1","Actors. I believe Elle Fanning played Cinderella? Or one of the Disney movies.","p022","p030",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
3384,99,136,5,"Person 2","Ah, that may explain why I'm not familiar. Are your parents married?","p022","p030",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
3385,99,136,6,"Person 1","Yup. Married for many years and still together so i don't know what they're going through. I'm sure it's tough. What about you?","p022","p030",2,0.6667,1.6667,3
3386,99,136,7,"Person 2","My parents split when I was five. I really had a hard time dealing with it during my teenage years. So, I can empathize to a certain extent. I think it would be easier to process as an adult.","p022","p030",3,1.3333,2.3333,3.6667
3387,99,136,8,"Person 1","I am sorry to hear that. Were you old enough to really understand and realize what happened with your parents?","p022","p030",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3388,99,136,9,"Person 2","Divorce is something that unfolds as a child matures. At the time I was aware of the situation, but unfamiliar with the emotions and change that came with your parents splitting up. My father was absent for the lions share of my childhood years, so I spent a lot of time asking why.","p022","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,3.3333
3389,99,136,10,"Person 1","Ah, so sorry you had to go through all of that. Didn't mean to bring those thoughts back in your head.","p022","p030",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3390,99,136,11,"Person 2","No worries. Anyway, I think that if two people are unhappy together divorce is the best option for all concerned.","p022","p030",2,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
3391,99,136,12,"Person 1","Definitely. There's no point in staying together if you're going to fight and argue, especially in front of your children.","p022","p030",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
3392,99,136,13,"Person 2","Exactly, two happy and constructive homes are a far sight better than one unhappy one.","p022","p030",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.6667
3393,99,136,14,"Person 1","I wonder how Dakota and Elle Fanning are doing now. I don't remember if the article stated how old they were when their parents divorced.","p022","p030",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
3394,99,136,15,"Person 2","It said they were 22 and 18. So, they are both more or less adults and probably living on their own.","p022","p030",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2
3395,99,136,16,"Person 1","That's good to know.  But yeah to sum it all up for me, it's a sad situation but like you said.. as long as everyone is happy.","p022","p030",2.3333,0.3333,2,2
3396,99,136,17,"Person 2","I feel the same way","p022","p030",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
3397,99,136,18,"Person 1","It was nice talking to you! Thanks for sharing your story as well. bye!","p022","p030",2,0,1.3333,1
3398,99,136,19,"Person 2","bye","p022","p030",1,0.6667,1,1
3399,99,137,0,"Person 1","I think it's always sad when parents get divorced.  Even if the daughters are \"adults,\" it still must be very sad that their parents are splitting.","p062","p043",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
3400,99,137,1,"Person 2","I don't think you can say it's ALWAYS sad, as there's plenty of circumstances in which a divorce is healthy for all parties involved.","p062","p043",2,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
3401,99,137,2,"Person 1","I'd say that even in the situations where it's the healthiest for all parties, it's still sad that it came to that.  But I understand your point.","p062","p043",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3402,99,137,3,"Person 2","I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better.","p062","p043",2,0.6667,2,3
3403,99,137,4,"Person 1","I'm sorry to hear your parents divorced.  How did you view their divorce then and how do you view it now?  Do you think it was for the best?","p062","p043",2,0.3333,2,1.6667
3404,99,137,5,"Person 2","I was crushed by it as a child. As an adult though, I think it was a good idea. I just didn't understand the differences they had as a child. I tried to ignore the numerous arguments everyday.","p062","p043",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,3.3333
3405,99,137,6,"Person 1","I thought the article was pretty glib about it all, focusing more on the fact that the day is apparently hot.  Then again, it was TMZ.","p062","p043",2,2,1.3333,2
3406,99,137,7,"Person 2","Yeah, stellar journalism lol. The article being brief was probably the point. This is a study afterall.","p062","p043",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.3333
3407,99,137,8,"Person 1","Not that it matters, but I wonder about the circumstances regarding this type of divorce.  I can understand couples with kids and, you know, 8 years into marriage discovering that they can't keep doing it.  But 27 years, with adult kids.  That I don't readily comprehend.   I guess he got bored or something.","p062","p043",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
3408,99,137,9,"Person 2","I honestly think humans aren't meant for these long term relationships. No matter how great your spouse/girlfriend is, you will tire of her eventually. And the reasons that they annoy you will keep multiplying until you ask yourself what the point of this relationship is.","p062","p043",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
3409,99,137,10,"Person 1","Yeah.  I also wonder how much being on the periphery of fame and fortune influences things.  You see a lifestyle that's more tempting but that you can't really participate in.  I wonder if that leads people to more strongly feel a desire for \"more\" and it's easier to be discontent with what you have.","p062","p043",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
3410,99,137,11,"Person 2","I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people.","p062","p043",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
3411,99,137,12,"Person 1","Yeah, there's no question that opportunity is a huge part of that, and attraction in general.  We're sort of attracted to \"best available,\" whoever that is.  When your rich and famous daughters improve your \"best available\" I can see how it would be easy to stray.","p062","p043",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
3412,99,137,13,"Person 2","It also brings excitement. When an attractive girl comes into your life, whether its because she works with you or she's a friend of a friend, everything gets more exciting. You care about whether you wore nice looking clothes and whether your haircut is on point. The chase is probably the most exciting part of life.","p062","p043",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
3413,99,137,14,"Person 1","Yeah, it pretty much all boils down to chasing trim.","p062","p043",1.3333,0,1.3333,2
3414,99,137,15,"Person 2","Our base needs are basically that and filling our stomachs lol.","p062","p043",1.6667,0.3333,1,2.3333
3415,99,137,16,"Person 1","Yeah.  Just to be clear, I wasn't making fun of you.  I agree that these are biological drives we can't ignore.  I was just stating that in a glib way.","p062","p043",1.6667,0.6667,1,2.3333
3416,99,137,17,"Person 2","Oh, I didn't even consider that you were possibly making fun of me. I'm easy going, even if you had been, I wouldn't care. When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind?","p062","p043",2,0.3333,1.3333,2
3417,99,137,18,"Person 1","Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me.","p062","p043",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
3418,99,137,19,"Person 2","If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a good day.","p062","p043",2,0.3333,1.6667,3
3419,99,137,20,"Person 1","Yeah, nice talking to you.  bye","p062","p043",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
3420,99,137,21,"Person 2","bye","p062","p043",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
3421,99,138,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about the article?","p005","p050",1,0.6667,1,1
3422,99,138,1,"Person 2","It is terrible...I have never been a fan of divorce","p005","p050",4,2,3,2.6667
3423,99,138,2,"Person 1","Me too","p005","p050",1.3333,1.6667,2,2
3424,99,138,3,"Person 2","I always believe it is workable","p005","p050",2.3333,1,2,2.3333
3425,99,138,4,"Person 1","only if they both willing to make it work","p005","p050",2,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
3426,99,138,5,"Person 2","Yeah..that is what most people aint willing to do","p005","p050",2,1,1.3333,2.3333
3427,99,138,6,"Person 1","And that is really sad","p005","p050",3,1.3333,2.3333,2
3428,99,138,7,"Person 2","Can you divorce?","p005","p050",1,0.6667,1,1
3429,99,138,8,"Person 1","Not sure i ever want that. And you?","p005","p050",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
3430,99,138,9,"Person 2","I dont see myself doing it","p005","p050",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2
3431,99,138,10,"Person 1","Good to know we on same page as that","p005","p050",2.3333,0.3333,1,1.6667
3432,99,138,11,"Person 2","yea..the institution should be well guarded","p005","p050",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
3433,99,138,12,"Person 1","I support that","p005","p050",1.6667,0.3333,2,2
3434,99,138,13,"Person 2","Nice talking with you. bye","p005","p050",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1

3437,99,138,16,"Person 1","what do you think can be done to prevent such things reoccurring in the society?","p005","p050",1,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3438,99,138,17,"Person 2","People should know the effects of these on kids","p005","p050",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
3439,99,138,18,"Person 1","And before getting into any marriage be sure you really want to spend the rest of your life with that person","p005","p050",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667
3440,99,138,19,"Person 2","Spot on!!!!","p005","p050",3.6667,0,1.6667,2

3446,99,139,3,"Person 2","why do you think that is?","p035","p024",1,0.6667,1,1
3447,99,139,4,"Person 1","People think everyday will be a fairy tale.","p035","p024",1.6667,1,1,1.6667
3448,99,139,5,"Person 2","yeah its just not realistic no one is perfect and can give you that fairy tale life.","p035","p024",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667

3468,99,139,25,"Person 2","its been good brother. goodbye","p035","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1,1
3469,99,139,26,"Person 1","you too! bye","p035","p024",1.6667,0,1,1
3470,99,140,0,"Person 1","I was a little surprised that the Fanning's were in the news. I don't keep up with this stuff that much.","p002","p038",2,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3471,99,140,1,"Person 2","I don't either. I don't get why this is even news","p002","p038",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
3472,99,140,2,"Person 1","Haha exactly. I remember Dakota Fanning from when I was a kid but were his parents really ever in movie's themselves?","p002","p038",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
3473,99,140,3,"Person 2","Wait Dakota is a guy? I thought he was that little girl that played in Uptown Girls with Brittany Murphy. whoops. I don't think so, I've never heard of them but then again I apparently am way off on who I thought any of these people were lol","p002","p038",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
3474,99,140,4,"Person 1","It appears that I'm the one out of touch. She is indeed a girl. The point remains..why are her parents in the news :D","p002","p038",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1.6667
3475,99,140,5,"Person 2","hahaha who knows. Some reporter somewhere apparently thinks we care about this. I feel sorry for them. Like who wants their divorce splashed all over the news?","p002","p038",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.3333
3476,99,140,6,"Person 1","Ehh I wonder. Sometimes it seems that certain celebrities like it and others don't. I am a private person so I really do not understand this type of thing.","p002","p038",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
3477,99,140,7,"Person 2","Same here. I don't know why you'd ever enjoy having your personal life and situations splashed on every tabloid. I can understand somewhat if you're a celeb. It comes with the job, but if her parents aren't famous except by her it seems terrible to publish their business","p002","p038",2,2,2,1.3333
3478,99,140,8,"Person 1","Do you think her parents put this in the news themselves?","p002","p038",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
3479,99,140,9,"Person 2","Maybe I guess I just can't wrap my head around the why. They aren't famous themselves (I don't think) unless they're trying to create some fame","p002","p038",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1
3480,99,140,10,"Person 1","Maybe they're trying to get some fame :D. It seems that the dad just up and left though. The article mentioned that he is not fighting that hard for the assets.","p002","p038",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3481,99,140,11,"Person 2","I guess maybe it was amicable? Maybe one of those situations where they stay together till the kids are grown","p002","p038",1,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3482,99,140,12,"Person 1","I guess it would be weird to fight over money your kid made for the most part anyway.","p002","p038",1.6667,1,1,2
3483,99,140,13,"Person 2","that is true. neither one are probably really entitled to any of it lol","p002","p038",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
3484,99,140,14,"Person 1","If I was in this position I can't see myself even keeping any of it. I would feel embarrassed","p002","p038",2.3333,1,1,1.6667
3485,99,140,15,"Person 2","I would be too. I'd feel like I was embarrassing my kid too.","p002","p038",2,1,1.3333,1.6667
3486,99,140,16,"Person 1","At least there aren't stories about them stealing their kid's money. I've heard this happened with Gary Coleman","p002","p038",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
3487,99,140,17,"Person 2","And Malculay Caulkin. I think his stepdad stole millions from all 8 of his kids","p002","p038",1.6667,2,1.3333,1
3488,99,140,18,"Person 1","That's super sad. I mean you already have your kid working at a super early age(whether they see it as work or not) and to steal from them is despicable.","p002","p038",3.3333,2,2,1.6667
3489,99,140,19,"Person 2","yeah no kidding. It's child labor and the kid doesn't even get anything out of it except a lifetime of emotional problems. Like every child star on Disney","p002","p038",3,2,1.6667,2
3490,99,140,20,"Person 1","Lol and lets not even get into the rumors about the shady stuff that goes on. I mean I get that movies and shows need kids to act in them but I don't think as a parent I could like force my kids to be actors if they didn't push it themselves.","p002","p038",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3491,99,140,21,"Person 2","No same here. I'm choosing a simple ordinary life for my kids maybe poorer but happier in the long run","p002","p038",2,0.6667,0.6667,2
3492,99,140,22,"Person 1","And they can actually have a normal childhood. Imagine if your kid was like 10 and paparazzi were always hounding him for pictures. I can imagine that would mess up normal development in a way","p002","p038",3,1,2.3333,1.6667
3493,99,140,23,"Person 2","I can't even imagine what that would do to a kid","p002","p038",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
3494,99,140,24,"Person 1","I have no more thoughts on the topic haha. Nice chatting with you. bye","p002","p038",2,0.6667,0.6667,1
3495,99,140,25,"Person 2","you too bye","p002","p038",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
3496,94,141,0,"Person 1","The ISIS is a global threat","p050","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
3497,94,141,1,"Person 2","It's pretty vile, that's for sure.","p050","p062",3,1,3.3333,1.3333
3498,94,141,2,"Person 1","I feel the whole world power should stand up against them","p050","p062",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
3499,94,141,3,"Person 2","I agree. Although I also think these countries that house and tolerate radical Islam need to step up as well.  They need to be forced to make a choice between civil societies or barbarism.","p050","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3500,94,141,4,"Person 1","Of course. That should be done. I mean, why protect the same pest harming and maiming you/","p050","p062",3,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3501,94,141,5,"Person 2","Agreed.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of cultures where passivity is the norm for the populace.  They accept whatever tyrant it is that wants to lead and abuse them.","p050","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
3502,94,141,6,"Person 1","They they will be at the receiving end...","p050","p062",1.6667,1,1,1.3333
3503,94,141,7,"Person 2","Absolutely.  And so, to some degree, they deserve their fate.","p050","p062",2,1.3333,1,2.3333
3504,94,141,8,"Person 1","I agree with that. What the world is expected to do is to prevent their spread","p050","p062",2,1,1.3333,1.3333
3505,94,141,9,"Person 2","Absolutely.  You can't allow that virus to infect civilized cultures.","p050","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
3506,94,141,10,"Person 1","Exactly my point.","p050","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1,1.3333
3507,94,141,11,"Person 2","And yet there are many people and countries who like to think we're the bad guys.  People should get a clue and look in the face of true barbarism.","p050","p062",3,2,1.6667,1.6667
3508,94,141,12,"Person 1","It is sad really. We trying to do all we can to protect the world yet all we get in return is blame.","p050","p062",3,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
3509,94,141,13,"Person 2","Absolutely.  But when you're the biggest fish, people are going to resent you.  We spend too much time concerning ourselves with what other people think of us.  Who cares?  They resent us because of our power, not because of how we wield it.  They want us to be weak.  That's when they \"approve\" of what we do.","p050","p062",3,1.3333,2,2.3333
3510,94,141,14,"Person 1","Yea...i agree with that. hope we can exchange our bye","p050","p062",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3511,94,141,15,"Person 2","I think we need a few more rounds.  We can do this quickly.  I'd love to see us actively destroy ISIS.","p050","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
3512,94,141,16,"Person 1","Same here...more arms for destruction","p050","p062",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
3513,94,141,17,"Person 2","Be interesting to see if terrorism is discussed at all in the upcoming election.  Probably not.","p050","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
3514,94,141,18,"Person 1","I would love that myself...bye","p050","p062",2.3333,0,1,1.6667
3515,94,141,19,"Person 2","yeah, good chatting.  bye","p050","p062",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1
3516,94,142,0,"Person 1","Hey there. SO I found this article absolutely heartbreaking. Such a bad situation for so many.","p023","p002",4.6667,2,4,3
3517,94,142,1,"Person 2","Yea it's definitely sad. I can't imagine growing up in a situation like this let alone tying to provide for a family.","p023","p002",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
3518,94,142,2,"Person 1","It's just insane. I feel like the war on terror has been a massive failure.","p023","p002",4,2,2.3333,2.3333
3519,94,142,3,"Person 2","More like a waste. Terrorists are way more of a threat to their own countries compared to a threat to the USA.","p023","p002",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
3520,94,142,4,"Person 1","I wholeheartedly agree. I hate to say it, but I think our country being involved in perpetuating these regime change wars does more harm than good.","p023","p002",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3521,94,142,5,"Person 2","Kind of. When US armed forces are in a country fighting terrorism this allows the home country to take a back seat. If US forces were not there these countries would have to face the problem head on from a military aspect as well as cultural.","p023","p002",2,2,2,2.3333
3522,94,142,6,"Person 1","Agreed. They need to handle their problems on their own. In many cases we say it's to spread democracy, but a majority of middle east countries just want to run things their own way. I feel terrible about the kids there that have been indoctrinated. The poor parents may never have their kids back.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
3523,94,142,7,"Person 2","Using kids as tools is definitely the worst aspect. I find it hard to see how people can kill in the name of a religion. Seems so wrong.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
3524,94,142,8,"Person 1","It's pretty ridiculous. It's not just the kids either. The women are treated like second rate citizens. The article mentioned how women are being \"redistributed\". That's pretty sick.","p023","p002",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
3525,94,142,9,"Person 2","As well as just blindly killing people for having cell phones. I wonder if some of these organizations only claim the religious aspect but really have other motives.","p023","p002",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
3526,94,142,10,"Person 1","I wouldn't doubt that at all. I think the fact that they are using white flags as a way of disguising bombs is reprehensible. It would be great if all of the middle east countries came together to fix their problems.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
3527,94,142,11,"Person 2","These organizations also make it worse for every citizen when they leave their home countries. So many people are racist as they think all middle eastern people are supportive of terrorism.","p023","p002",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
3528,94,142,12,"Person 1","Your right. If people would just open their minds a little bit, they would find that there are good and bad people in every religious sect. I know some people that are in fact Muslim that completely disavow what's going on.","p023","p002",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
3529,94,142,13,"Person 2","I hope that this cycle runs it's course soon. The war on terror has gone on for 18 years now and I struggle to see if any progress has been made.","p023","p002",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
3530,94,142,14,"Person 1","I haven't seen any progress. I think that the more our military has a presence there, the more hostile the area becomes until it's completely destabilized. This is one of the paths towards radicalization. I will never get over the fact that they are brainwashing children to be cold blooded killers.","p023","p002",3.3333,2,4,2.3333
3531,94,142,15,"Person 2","Yea that's really disturbing. It kind of highlights the animalistic nature of man if twisted at an early age.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3532,94,142,16,"Person 1","Yeah for sure. I can only imagine the brutal techniques used to radicalize them at such a young age. They should be doing kid stuff. Not being forced to participate in avts of war.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
3533,94,142,17,"Person 2","Just having a kid kill somebody is enough to really hinder development. I can't imagine what would go through a kid's head in that instance.","p023","p002",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
3534,94,142,18,"Person 1","It's hard to get your mind around it. Reading this gave me some pretty disturbing images, so one can only imagine what it's like to live in this nightmare.","p023","p002",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
3535,94,142,19,"Person 2","I can imagine it would be extremely hard to live a normal life in this situation. Even trying to just work a normal job would be scary knowing you could die at any time.","p023","p002",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
3536,94,142,20,"Person 1","It's no wonder there are so many fleeing. I would do the same.","p023","p002",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3537,94,142,21,"Person 2",":(. That's all I have to say on this situation. bye","p023","p002",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
3538,94,142,22,"Person 1","bye","p023","p002",1,0.6667,1,1
3539,94,143,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the article?","p022","p007",1.3333,0.6667,1,1
3540,94,143,1,"Person 2","I feel really bad for the innocent people stuck in the middle of that warzone. I don't understand why the middle east is such a hub for conflict. It is really needless.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,4,2.3333
3541,94,143,2,"Person 1","It's insane. I thought we were close to getting rid of ISIS.. i guess not.","p022","p007",3.6667,2,2.3333,2
3542,94,143,3,"Person 2","Well I don't think you could really ever get rid of any militant group. There are always martyrs and inspire youth to take up their cause.","p022","p007",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
3543,94,143,4,"Person 1","That's true. To think of all the innocent children being killed is saddening.","p022","p007",3.6667,2,3.6667,1.6667
3544,94,143,5,"Person 2","Yea kids get it the worst, they are either indoctrinated into the groups, orphaned by war, or killed/tortured by the bad guys. And if they live theya re traumatized for the rest of their lives.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,4.3333,1.6667
3545,94,143,6,"Person 1","Yea, guaranteed they will be traumatized. I think i read they were putting people on poles? That's disgusting.","p022","p007",4.3333,2,4,2
3546,94,143,7,"Person 2","They do all sorts of messed up things over there. My friend served a combat duty and told me he saw peoples heads on pikes and just bodies in the streets.","p022","p007",3,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
3547,94,143,8,"Person 1","My god, that's horrifying. I feel bad for all the soldiers that had to serve there as well. It's equally as traumatizing for them.","p022","p007",4.3333,2,4.6667,2
3548,94,143,9,"Person 2","For sure, my friend didnt speak for a week when he killed for the first time. He was in the bomb unit as well so you can imagine how stressful it is getting shot at let alone defusing IEDs","p022","p007",3.6667,2,4.3333,3.3333
3549,94,143,10,"Person 1","Yeah that's really tough. It's sad because i don't think ISIS is going anywhere anytime soon. I'm expecting more deaths to come which is crazy to think about.","p022","p007",3.3333,2,3,2
3550,94,143,11,"Person 2","that palce is like..steeped in death. I think theyve been in conflict for a few hundred years at least. In general i mean; of course militant groups are different now.","p022","p007",2.6667,2,2,1.3333
3551,94,143,12,"Person 1","Let's hope none of that ever makes it way towards the US. That we're free from war.","p022","p007",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
3552,94,143,13,"Person 2","Agreed. Conflict like that here would be crazy. Especially because everyone and their mother owns a gun or two.","p022","p007",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
3553,94,143,14,"Person 1","It would definitely be an all out battlefield. Do you think there is anything that people can do to help the situation?","p022","p007",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
3554,94,143,15,"Person 2","In the middle east? I don't think so. Theya re pretty set in their ways over there; I don't even think the war effort by us is even really making a difference.","p022","p007",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
3555,94,143,16,"Person 1","What do they do with babies there? Hope they're not killed as well.. actually i don't know if i even want to know.","p022","p007",3.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
3556,94,143,17,"Person 2","I..I don't know. I didn't even think of that. Man that could be really horrifying...","p022","p007",4,1.3333,3.3333,2
3557,94,143,18,"Person 1","I think we will leave it at that. It was nice talking to you!","p022","p007",2,0.3333,1,1.3333
3558,94,143,19,"Person 2","Likewise, great convo. Have a wonderful rest of the workday random turker. :)","p022","p007",2.3333,0,1,1
3559,94,143,20,"Person 1","bye!","p022","p007",1.3333,0,1,1
3560,94,143,21,"Person 2","goodbye!","p022","p007",1.3333,0,1,1
3561,94,144,0,"Person 1","how do you feel about the sad situation?","p005","p043",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
3562,94,144,1,"Person 2","It's absolutely terrible...I can hardly believe that it's real. These fanatical ISIS people are barely human...","p005","p043",5,2,4.3333,2.6667
3563,94,144,2,"Person 1","I feel so sad reading that","p005","p043",4,2,4.3333,2.3333
3564,94,144,3,"Person 2","It seems you could lose your life for basically any reason. Imagine getting killed because they discovered you had a cell phone!!","p005","p043",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
3565,94,144,4,"Person 1","That was really sick","p005","p043",3.6667,2,3,2
3566,94,144,5,"Person 2","I can totally understand why millions of their citizens have fled to other countries for safety.","p005","p043",3.3333,1,4.3333,2.6667
3567,94,144,6,"Person 1","I would do the same if i was in that country","p005","p043",2.3333,1,3.3333,2.6667
3568,94,144,7,"Person 2","Yup, I would do anything to get out. I would be insanely desperate.","p005","p043",3.6667,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
3569,94,144,8,"Person 1","That act was inhumane","p005","p043",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
3570,94,144,9,"Person 2","Yeah, it's a wonder that they can get away with doing it. The regular people have the numbers vs these ISIS fanatics but sadly they probably don't have any weaponry.","p005","p043",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
3571,94,144,10,"Person 1","Only if they can be helped","p005","p043",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
3572,94,144,11,"Person 2","That's understandable, it's difficult to face murders who will kill you for any reason.","p005","p043",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
3573,94,144,12,"Person 1","I feel so sad for them","p005","p043",4,2,3.6667,2.3333
3574,94,144,13,"Person 2","Yeah, thank god they've basically been beaten. ISIS has lost nearly all of the land that they controlled in prior years.","p005","p043",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.3333
3575,94,144,14,"Person 1","I'm really happy about that at least","p005","p043",3.3333,0,1.6667,2
3576,94,144,15,"Person 2","Yup, one of the best things that Trump did. He was really motivated to stamp them out ASAP.","p005","p043",3.3333,0,1.6667,2.3333
3577,94,144,16,"Person 1","That was really positive","p005","p043",3,0,1.6667,2.3333
3578,94,144,17,"Person 2","It really should've been done years ago. In the past, we would only arm the Iraqi and Afghanistani soldiers. And then ISIS would attack them, the defending soldiers would flee and ISIS would just take their gear and weapons.","p005","p043",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
3579,94,144,18,"Person 1","I hope they are really defeated completely soon..... goodbye","p005","p043",3,0.6667,1,2
3580,94,144,19,"Person 2","Yeah, though I believe they are nearly finished already. Evil like this will probably always exist though...It was nice talking to you. bye","p005","p043",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
3581,94,145,0,"Person 1","hey what were your thoughts on this","p068","p024",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
3582,94,145,1,"Person 2","i think its said anytime civilians have to go through this. what about you?","p068","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
3583,94,145,2,"Person 1","its sad in this day and age this is happening","p068","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
3584,94,145,3,"Person 2","yeah its quite sad honestly. what do you think can be done to fix this?","p068","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
3585,94,145,4,"Person 1","I think more military presence needs to be there from outside nations","p068","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,2
3586,94,145,5,"Person 2","definitely also we need to stop being the world police","p068","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
3587,94,145,6,"Person 1","true but things like this they cant help themselves then its spreads","p068","p024",1.6667,1,2,2
3588,94,145,7,"Person 2","true we have to find a middle line of helping and keeping away at the same time","p068","p024",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
3589,94,145,8,"Person 1","yeah i agree more peace in the world","p068","p024",1.3333,0,1.3333,2.3333
3590,94,145,9,"Person 2","do you think that is possible?","p068","p024",1.3333,0.6667,1,1
3591,94,145,10,"Person 1","maybe someday we all seem more connected with social media something can be done","p068","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
3592,94,145,11,"Person 2","yeah definitely with social media you see people from other countries interacting with each other like they're neighbors","p068","p024",1.3333,0,2.3333,2
3593,94,145,12,"Person 1","exactly i think more people are informed and want to help","p068","p024",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,2
3594,94,145,13,"Person 2","yeah people seem to care they just dont have the outlet to show it","p068","p024",2,1,2.3333,2
3595,94,145,14,"Person 1","i think with this violence only violence can combat it","p068","p024",1.6667,1,0.6667,2.3333
3596,94,145,15,"Person 2","yeah some people are just evil and have no other solution","p068","p024",2.3333,1,1.3333,2
3597,94,145,16,"Person 1","they have alot of isis propogana over there im sure this thing is just going to spread so sad","p068","p024",2.6667,1,2,2
3598,94,145,17,"Person 2","definitely propaganda is one of the worst things ever created by man","p068","p024",3,1.6667,2,2
3599,94,145,18,"Person 1","yes need to cut of the snake at the head","p068","p024",3,1,0.6667,2
3600,94,145,19,"Person 2","hopefully things get better","p068","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1
3601,94,145,20,"Person 1","agree it was a great conversation thanks! bye","p068","p024",2.3333,0,0.6667,1
3602,94,145,21,"Person 2","bye","p068","p024",1,0.6667,0.3333,1
3603,147,146,0,"Person 1","So I thought that was pretty tragic.  100,000 people is a huge number to be affected, killed even.  What do you think?","p029","p007",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
3604,147,146,1,"Person 2","It's crazy. I can't imagine dying because of some toxic smoke. Not only can you be killed by suffocation, but if you survive down the line you could get cancer. Totally not cool","p029","p007",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
3605,147,146,2,"Person 1","Yeah, what the heck?? And infants are most vulnerable which is also truly terrible.","p029","p007",4,2,3,2
3606,147,146,3,"Person 2","Was the smoke toxic from pollution or was it because of what was burning?","p029","p007",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
3607,147,146,4,"Person 1","I think it was from what was burning but I'm not entirely clear.  Either way, it seemed like the people couldn't avoid it bc it was in the air so they were basially helpless","p029","p007",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
3608,147,146,5,"Person 2","Yea and it''s not like you can hold your breath forever. 100k though, that is so many people. Way too much death for sure.","p029","p007",3,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
3609,147,146,6,"Person 1","yeah exactly, like there was nothing they could do.  And yeah that is a tremendous amount, like that could wipe out an entire city.  what on earth","p029","p007",3.3333,1,3,1.6667
3610,147,146,7,"Person 2","That's legit a small town. Grief and suffering on an unimaginable scale. It is really sickening. I wonder if there will be better precautions in the future so this doesn't happen again.","p029","p007",4.3333,1.3333,3,2
3611,147,146,8,"Person 1","Yeah that's what I was thinking.  The article didn't touch much on specific actions that could be taken, more just generalizations.  Is anyone even doing anything to prevent this?","p029","p007",2,1,2,1.6667
3612,147,146,9,"Person 2","I'd hope so. A repeat of this would be even more tragic.","p029","p007",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
3613,147,146,10,"Person 1","Yeah, I got the feeling this was an ongoing thing that kept happening each year, maybe not on such a large scale but still happening","p029","p007",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
3614,147,146,11,"Person 2","Man that is messed up if so. Death is death.You would think some government agency or company would step in and try to prevent accidents like this from happening.","p029","p007",3.3333,1,2.6667,2.3333
3615,147,146,12,"Person 1","Yeah you would think so.  I feel quite certain something like that that was killing 100,000 people at a time would not fly in the United States.","p029","p007",2.6667,1,2,2
3616,147,146,13,"Person 2","Well Cali has a ton of wildfires, but they actively fight those every year.","p029","p007",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
3617,147,146,14,"Person 1","Yeah definitely, I think we are pouring a lot of resources into preventing them.  Plus did they cause that many people to die?  I know there were some deaths but I didn't think it was on quite as grand of a scale.","p029","p007",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
3618,147,146,15,"Person 2","I think maybe like 300-400 last year? but no not on the scale of these chemical fires.","p029","p007",2,1.6667,2,1
3619,147,146,16,"Person 1","Yeah that is still a lot of lives to lose though.  I guess we are pouring resources into fighting them like you said but I'm not sure about prevention or if anything could be done to prevent those.  I thought they were somewhat of a natural occurrence.","p029","p007",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
3620,147,146,17,"Person 2","Well yea lightning can strike and start a fire, so can some stupid camper who didnt put out their campfire; or a person throwing a cigarette out the window of their car. I don't think you can prevent them 100% but maybe if people do not do silly thing you could prevent like 50% of the fires.","p029","p007",2,1.6667,1.3333,2
3621,147,146,18,"Person 1","Yeah you are right my friend!  Careless mistakes like that can be highly costly even to the extent of people's lives.  Well it has been a pleasure discussing this with you, I hope you have an enjoyable afternoon.  goodbye","p029","p007",2.3333,0,2.3333,2
3622,147,146,19,"Person 2","Yea very good convo. Have a great rest of the workday random turker! Goodbye!","p029","p007",2.3333,0,0.6667,1
3623,147,147,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about ISIS's methods of manipulation and control?","p030","p050",1.6667,1,2,2
3624,147,147,1,"Person 2","I hate everything about ISIS..i really hope they can be totally eliminated...You?","p030","p050",4.3333,2,3,2.3333
3625,147,147,2,"Person 1","Well, I think their methods are certainly effective. I don't condone them by any means, but they have disillusioned youth from all over the world joining their rank and file.","p030","p050",1.6667,1.5,2.3333,2
3626,147,147,3,"Person 2","It is sad really...","p030","p050",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
3627,147,147,4,"Person 1","The thought of children being forced to commit executions is a special kind of venality.","p030","p050",3,2,3.3333,2
3628,147,147,5,"Person 2","It really is. I wish we can have more ways to control this though","p030","p050",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
3629,147,147,6,"Person 1","This kind of radicalism is rooted in ideologies older than civilization itself. I think the only way to get rid of it would be to allow it to devour itself.","p030","p050",2,1.5,2,1.6667
3630,147,147,7,"Person 2","Yea, we should totally protect our self from it. That is the only way we can intervene.","p030","p050",2.6667,1.5,2,1.6667
3631,147,147,8,"Person 1","I'm inclined to agree. By giving groups like this an enemy we are only feeding the fire of their zealotry.","p030","p050",2,1.5,2.3333,1.6667
3632,147,147,9,"Person 2","Of course..the attention will make them grow stronger","p030","p050",2,1.5,2.3333,2
3633,147,147,10,"Person 1","How do you feel about the US's influence in Iraq throughout the past couple of decades?","p030","p050",1,1,1.6667,1
3634,147,147,11,"Person 2","In as much as we playing the big brother role, I feel we should focus more on how to protect ourselves.","p030","p050",2,1.5,2,2
3635,147,147,12,"Person 1","Do you think we should support the people being displaced by the conflict in Iraq?","p030","p050",1,1,2.3333,1.6667
3636,147,147,13,"Person 2","We should spread our self out too much..we do the little we can and other countries should take in those they can","p030","p050",2,1,2.6667,2
3637,147,147,14,"Person 1","I'm of a similar opinion. There's only so much empathy in a human population. After a certain point the reserves are exhausted and resentment begins to creep in.","p030","p050",2,1,2,2
3638,147,147,15,"Person 2","Exactly..","p030","p050",1.6667,1,2,1
3639,147,147,16,"Person 1","Does fear play a meaningful part in the decisions you make in your daily life?","p030","p050",1.3333,1,1,1
3640,147,147,17,"Person 2","It does...I can be carefree at times though","p030","p050",2.3333,1.5,1,2
3641,147,147,18,"Person 1","Well, I'm glad you get some carefree moments. It was nice chatting with you! bye","p030","p050",2,0,1,1
3642,147,147,19,"Person 2","bye","p030","p050",1,1,1,1
3643,147,148,0,"Person 1","Tell me how you feel about the article?","p005","p038",1,0.6667,1.3333,1
3644,147,148,1,"Person 2","It makes me feel sad. So many people have died","p005","p038",3,2,4,2.3333
3645,147,148,2,"Person 1","i feel the same","p005","p038",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
3646,147,148,3,"Person 2","It says its an annual problem. I wish there was something that could be done","p005","p038",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
3647,147,148,4,"Person 1","what do you think went wrong?","p005","p038",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
3648,147,148,5,"Person 2","I have no idea. What do you think?","p005","p038",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
3649,147,148,6,"Person 1","I do not have idea too","p005","p038",1,1,1,1.3333
3650,147,148,7,"Person 2","Do you think anything can be done?","p005","p038",1.6667,1,1,1
3651,147,148,8,"Person 1","Not sure and you?","p005","p038",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
3652,147,148,9,"Person 2","I'm not sure.","p005","p038",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
3653,147,148,10,"Person 1","But it's really so sad how haze can kill thousands of people","p005","p038",3,2,3.3333,2
3654,147,148,11,"Person 2","It really is. We get haze and smog from time to time and I've never thought about it being harmful except in the case of like car accidents","p005","p038",2,2,3,2.3333
3655,147,148,12,"Person 1","I never thought so too","p005","p038",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
3656,147,148,13,"Person 2","I'm sure it'll happen again and again with more needless deaths. But I cannot figure out what could possibly be done to prevent it","p005","p038",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
3657,147,148,14,"Person 1","I really feel so sad for their families","p005","p038",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
3658,147,148,15,"Person 2","I wonder if there's anything set up to donate","p005","p038",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
3659,147,148,16,"Person 1","I hope so too, something just to help","p005","p038",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2
3660,147,148,17,"Person 2","No kidding those people need so much help its unreal","p005","p038",3.6667,1,3.3333,2
3661,147,148,18,"Person 1","it has been good chatting with you, goodbye","p005","p038",1.6667,0.3333,1,1
3662,147,148,19,"Person 2","bye","p005","p038",1,0.6667,1,1
3663,147,149,0,"Person 1","Its always sad when things like this happen","p024","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
3664,147,149,1,"Person 2","It's pretty amazing how many people they think died.  Although Indonesia has an extremely large population.  I think it's one of the top 4 or 5 in the world.","p024","p062",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
3665,147,149,2,"Person 1","Do you think that the polulation numbers had something to do with this?","p024","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
3666,147,149,3,"Person 2","Well, it just means the population is more dense, and more people get affected by the haze.","p024","p062",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
3667,147,149,4,"Person 1","didn't think of that one makes snese","p024","p062",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
3668,147,149,5,"Person 2","I think it's pitiful because it shows what the rest of the world is up against with respect to environmental issues.  These countries are more concerned about their economics than enivronment.  They burn down forests to make palm oil.","p024","p062",3,2,2.3333,3
3669,147,149,6,"Person 1","Yep, here in California seems we have wild fires every year as well. Less casualties of course but they're fires.","p024","p062",1.6667,2,1.3333,2.6667
3670,147,149,7,"Person 2","At least those ones aren't started intentionally.  Well, I mean some of them might be arson, but that's different.","p024","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
3671,147,149,8,"Person 1","yeah, this one was a whole other type of fire","p024","p062",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
3672,147,149,9,"Person 2","I just think it's amazing the different perspective different people have on society and value of life and that type of thing.  Can you imagine the U.S. government, or even state governments, allowing burning down forests that killed tens or hundreds of thousands of people like this?","p024","p062",3.3333,1,2.3333,3
3673,147,149,10,"Person 1","Some countries are just that openly corrupt.","p024","p062",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
3674,147,149,11,"Person 2","On the other hand, if they outlawed the palm oil industry, they might have hundreds of thousands of people starve.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
3675,147,149,12,"Person 1","its a tough subject I would just hope they found other ways to help people not starve","p024","p062",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
3676,147,149,13,"Person 2","Absolutely.  I believe palm oil production has some other really bad effect on the environment.  I can't remember what.  Maybe something to do with polluting the water.","p024","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
3677,147,149,14,"Person 1","that and the effect on the youngsters when they grow up","p024","p062",2,2,2.3333,2
3678,147,149,15,"Person 2","Yeah, that's the part they don't even know about.  I can't fathom the long-term damage to kids if this haze is killing hundreds of thousands outright.","p024","p062",2.3333,2,3.6667,3
3679,147,149,16,"Person 1","wish we had the medical knowledge to know what happens to them so they see the production of the palm oil is a bad thing","p024","p062",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
3680,147,149,17,"Person 2","That would be nice but I'm not sure it would get through to them.  Money talks more than the health concerns of millions of people they don't actually care about.","p024","p062",2.6667,2,1.6667,3
3681,147,149,18,"Person 1","money definitely is the root of all evil","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.6667
3682,147,149,19,"Person 2","Oh, it's gotta be.  That and contraception.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333
3683,147,149,20,"Person 1","and hard drugs addictions","p024","p062",2,1.3333,1,2.3333

3689,147,150,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the haze and fires?","p022","p043",1,0.5,1.6667,1
3690,147,150,1,"Person 2","Hey, that was probably the most surprising thing that I'd read today. I didn't realize that haze could kill 100,000 people!","p022","p043",3.3333,1,3,2.3333
3691,147,150,2,"Person 1","Wow, i must have read wrong because i 100,000 is a lot of people! I have family in Indonesia too","p022","p043",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
3692,147,150,3,"Person 2","Did they ever complain about the after effects of the fires?","p022","p043",1,1,2.3333,1.3333
3693,147,150,4,"Person 1","Nope, i never even heard about it so it must have been in another part. It's scary to think about though.","p022","p043",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
3694,147,150,5,"Person 2","Definitely scary!! California is constantly on fire, do we have a harmful haze too?","p022","p043",3.3333,1,2.3333,2
3695,147,150,6,"Person 1","I'm not sure but i have never heard of it. Oh yeah, there were those crazy fires just a couple months ago i think","p022","p043",2.3333,1.5,2.3333,1.6667
3696,147,150,7,"Person 2","It's more surprising to me when California isn't on fire...","p022","p043",2,2,1.6667,2
3697,147,150,8,"Person 1","That's true lol i've only been to Cali once. I heard it's terrible though. It's scarier than something like a hurricane because you can't really hide in your house.","p022","p043",3,2,3.3333,2
3698,147,150,9,"Person 2","I'm on the east coast but I have relatives in San Diego and they're constantly telling me horror stories about fires. A few times their house was a mile or so away from getting destroyed.","p022","p043",2.6667,2,2.3333,3
3699,147,150,10,"Person 1","Wow, they got lucky. It's scary to think that any day... your house could get burned. It's never guaranteed to be safe","p022","p043",2.6667,1,3,2
3700,147,150,11,"Person 2","Yup, life is like that though. Never know when you're going to experience a disaster. Btw, if you ever experience a fire endangering your home, turn on your sprinkler system. It has saved many million dollar homes.","p022","p043",2,0,2,2.3333
3701,147,150,12,"Person 1","Hmm, good tip. I'll keep that in mind! So you're from the east, you get hurricanes or tornados?","p022","p043",1.6667,0.5,2,1.6667
3702,147,150,13,"Person 2","Neither, although my phone gets tornado warnings all the time lol. I've never experienced one before.","p022","p043",2.3333,0,1.6667,2.3333
3703,147,150,14,"Person 1","Lucky! Yeah natural disasters are no fun. I've been through a hurricane. We were supposed to evacuate but my family decided to stay. Nothing major happened but it was scary seeing trees and fences get ripped apart through your windows.","p022","p043",3.6667,1,2.3333,3.3333
3704,147,150,15,"Person 2","Did you have a basement to shelter in? I think that's what you're supposed to do. I'm in NY btw. Why did your family decide to stay?","p022","p043",1.6667,0.5,1.3333,2.3333
3705,147,150,16,"Person 1","Nope no basement. Only boarded up windows and doors.","p022","p043",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
3706,147,150,17,"Person 2","Scary! I would've evacuated asap. I've seen too many rescue videos because people were too stubborn to leave. Good thing it ended up going ok though!","p022","p043",3.6667,1,2.6667,2
3707,147,150,18,"Person 1","Yup. Interesting fact, houses in FL don't have basements because of the hurricanes and flooding. Also, it was nice talking to you! bye!","p022","p043",2,0,1.6667,2
3708,147,150,19,"Person 2","Yeah, I knew some sections of the country didn't have basements. They are nice though!! And nice talking to you too! bye","p022","p043",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
3709,125,151,0,"Person 1","Man I feel so bad for that family. House fires are so random and it sucks that they happen. It is a shame that they lost their pets too :(","p007","p057",4,2,4.3333,2.3333
3710,125,151,1,"Person 2","Yeah I felt the same way. I was actually surprised the cats didn't escape, aren't they usually good at getting out of disasters?","p007","p057",3,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
3711,125,151,2,"Person 1","Usually yea. Maybe the smoke got them. Really sad. I hope the family is able to find a new home and move on..","p007","p057",3,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
3712,125,151,3,"Person 2","Yeah, NW D.C. is actually really lose to where I live, I wonder if its because a lot of these homes are really old and not up to code.","p007","p057",2,1.3333,2.6667,3
3713,125,151,4,"Person 1","It is possible. I could se it being an electrical fire. Especially in an older home.","p007","p057",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
3714,125,151,5,"Person 2","Yeah, thats probably the worst feeling too. Seeing your house burned and not knowing where you are going to sleep that night.","p007","p057",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
3715,125,151,6,"Person 1","I can't imagine literally losing everything in an instant. Especially my pets... I cant fathom what that family is going though.","p007","p057",4,2,4.3333,3
3716,125,151,7,"Person 2","Yeah there is something really terrible about something as innocent as cats and dogs dying in a tragic fire.","p007","p057",4,2,3.6667,2
3717,125,151,8,"Person 1","Yea I'm really like sympathetic to animals. I used to work at a rescue shelter. That's wher eI got my current bundle of pent up energy haha.","p007","p057",2.6667,0.6667,2,3.3333
3718,125,151,9,"Person 2","Yeah I am not really a cat person but the idea of any animal being trapped in a burning house makes me pretty emotional.","p007","p057",3,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
3719,125,151,10,"Person 1","Yea.. that isn't a great way to die.. I hope the children of that family are handling it ok","p007","p057",3,2,3.3333,2
3720,125,151,11,"Person 2","Absolute worst way to die. My cousins have cats and there are so fearful of everything and always trying to escape, that why I was so confused that they didn't get out","p007","p057",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
3721,125,151,12,"Person 1","I mean cats are usually pretty smart when they ahve to be as well so.. Maybe they were locked in a  room?","p007","p057",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
3722,125,151,13,"Person 2","Yeah so that was what I was thinking. If they didnt get out it means that they absolutely couldn't. Which makes this even sadder","p007","p057",3,2,3,2
3723,125,151,14,"Person 1","For sure.. I'm glad no humans were hurt, but the animal thing really pulls my heartstrings..","p007","p057",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
3724,125,151,15,"Person 2","They didnt mention insurance either. I hope they had good insurance and fire insurance is probably needed here also right?","p007","p057",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
3725,125,151,16,"Person 1","Yea thats usually covered in homeowners i think. Man if they didnt have insurance though...thats one bad hole to be stuck in. I really hope that they make it through this and get the support they need.","p007","p057",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
3726,125,151,17,"Person 2","Yeah not to mention that area is right after San Francisco and New York for the most expensive homes in the country. Big ouch there","p007","p057",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
3727,125,151,18,"Person 1","Oh yea.. Maybe some charitable organizations can help them out. That would be nice.","p007","p057",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
3728,125,151,19,"Person 2","Yeah they should probably look into goFundme or something simiar. Anyway it was nice talking to you. goodbye","p007","p057",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
3729,125,151,20,"Person 1","likewise! have a great rest of the workday :) goodbye!","p007","p057",2,0,1,1
3730,125,152,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the fire and what happened?","p022","p030",1,1,0.6667,1
3731,125,152,1,"Person 2","I think that the death of pets is always tragic for those they are dear to.","p022","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
3732,125,152,2,"Person 1","I agree. Do you own any pets?","p022","p030",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333

3734,125,152,4,"Person 1","I have two dogs. Love them to death so i can't even imagine what those people are going through.","p022","p030",4,0.6667,3.3333,3
3735,125,152,5,"Person 2","What kind of dogs are they?","p022","p030",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
3736,125,152,6,"Person 1","One is a Lab and the other is a Maltese","p022","p030",1.3333,1,0.6667,2.6667
3737,125,152,7,"Person 2","Neat. I had a golden retriever when I was a kid. He was my best friend.","p022","p030",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.6667
3738,125,152,8,"Person 1","Golden retrievers are really smart. So have you been through, or know anyone, that has been in a fire before","p022","p030",2,0.3333,1.6667,1
3739,125,152,9,"Person 2","Actually, no. I can't think of anyone even relating a story about a fire to me. How about you?","p022","p030",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.6667
3740,125,152,10,"Person 1","Nope, thank goodness. So what do you think that family that was in the fire should do now? They lost everything, it's terrible.","p022","p030",3.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
3741,125,152,11,"Person 2","Hopefully they were insured. I mean what do you do after a fire? You just start all over.","p022","p030",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
3742,125,152,12,"Person 1","It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad.","p022","p030",3.6667,2,3,2
3743,125,152,13,"Person 2","It's just scary to think about. Makes me feel sad.","p022","p030",3.3333,2,3,2
3744,125,152,14,"Person 1","Just the fact that the pets were trapped inside. I'm sure they'll look into a doggy door or something next time around.","p022","p030",3.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
3745,125,152,15,"Person 2","Yeah, was it mentioned how the fire started? i don't remember.","p022","p030",2,1,0.6667,1
3746,125,152,16,"Person 1","Me too. Did it mention what kind of pets they werE?","p022","p030",2,1,0.6667,1.3333

3748,125,152,18,"Person 1","I don't think so. The article was pretty brief and vague","p022","p030",1.6667,1.6667,0.6667,1.3333
3749,125,152,19,"Person 2","Cats are capable of much more than humans give them credit for","p022","p030",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333

3752,125,153,0,"Person 1","These stories are always sad to hear. Fires are probably one of the disasters I really fear.","p002","p024",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
3753,125,153,1,"Person 2","I can't imagine losing one pet let alone two.","p002","p024",3.6667,2,4.3333,2.3333
3754,125,153,2,"Person 1","Yea that's rough. At least the people all lived.","p002","p024",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
3755,125,153,3,"Person 2","thats about the only good thing","p002","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
3756,125,153,4,"Person 1","I remember my house burning down as a kid. In the moment it's so scary. The Red Cross really does a lot of work helping in these situations.","p002","p024",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,3.6667
3757,125,153,5,"Person 2","Do you have experience with the Red Cross?","p002","p024",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
3758,125,153,6,"Person 1","I can't remember which organization helped when I was a kid(was 5) but I have seen them help my neighbors when their apartment burned down.","p002","p024",2,0.6667,2,2.6667
3759,125,153,7,"Person 2","thats good that those organizations are in place to help","p002","p024",2,0,2.3333,2
3760,125,153,8,"Person 1","Yea it's nice but still minimal. Better to try and get insurance that covers a fire.","p002","p024",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
3761,125,153,9,"Person 2","yeah youre right about that","p002","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
3762,125,153,10,"Person 1","I wonder what the situation was like for the family to have to leave their pets. Must have happened fast.","p002","p024",2,1,3.6667,2
3763,125,153,11,"Person 2","i cant imagine the moments before the  fire started","p002","p024",2.6667,1.3333,4,2.3333
3764,125,153,12,"Person 1","I would assume that the family was asleep or how else could they have left the pets? That or were not in the home. Fires do start fast though.","p002","p024",1.6667,1.3333,3,2
3765,125,153,13,"Person 2","fires defnitely travel fast and silent sometimes too","p002","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
3766,125,153,14,"Person 1","Hard for a person to really combat it either. With an electrical or grease fire, water would only add to it.","p002","p024",1.6667,1.3333,3,2
3767,125,153,15,"Person 2","yeah most people arent knowledgeable on those things","p002","p024",1.3333,1,2,1.6667

3770,125,153,18,"Person 1","Yea I saw a fire take three apartments a few days before Christmas. I felt so bad, especially for the people who lost their stuff to water damage from the firefighters having to put it out","p002","p024",3.3333,2,4.3333,3.3333
3771,125,153,19,"Person 2","i can cope losing tv's phones etc but losing memories in pictures is scary","p002","p024",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333

3780,125,154,6,"Person 1","Yeah that's true.  That must be a real kick in the pants if the cause of the fire was your own doing too, and the insurance company doesnt pay out.","p063","p050",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
3781,125,154,7,"Person 2","another twist...I pray that is not the case though","p063","p050",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2

3863,302,157,3,"Person 2","i guess education about the problem is the best anyone can do at this point","p058","p001",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
3864,302,157,4,"Person 1","Yeah, I didn't know lung cancer was the second deadliest form of cancer either.","p058","p001",2,1.6667,1.6667,2

3871,302,157,11,"Person 2","i was thinking the same thing,i wonder how pollution effects people without lung cancer....i mean,it can't be good...just probably not as noticeable","p058","p001",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
3872,302,157,12,"Person 1","yeah, I feel like the article in general was lacking, interesting content but it definitely needed more info","p058","p001",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667

3874,302,157,14,"Person 1","I wonder if that was the intent, just to give us a taste and motivation to do further research on our own.","p058","p001",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
3875,302,157,15,"Person 2","certainly effective if that's what they wanted to do","p058","p001",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
3876,302,157,16,"Person 1","I feel like most people won't care about air pollution until it gets so bad they can hardly breathe, then maybe things will change.","p058","p001",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
3877,302,157,17,"Person 2","Yea,people will need to see and feel it in order to change,but i think by that time it'll be to late..it sucks","p058","p001",2.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
3878,302,157,18,"Person 1","Yep, that seems to be how it's been going with everything else. Our attention spans are so short it seems like no one can really be bothered with anything unless its a major issue that lasts a while and is right in our face.","p058","p001",2,1.3333,2,2
3879,302,157,19,"Person 2","i think it's honestly just human nature...it's weird that a behavior that probably helped us evolve and survive will most likely be our downfall","p058","p001",2.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
3880,302,157,20,"Person 1","That's a good point. I do think we could all be more proactive about positive change though. There's got to be a way to make it happen. Education is certainly one area that could improve.","p058","p001",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
3881,302,157,21,"Person 2","oh for sure,education is important to getting people to change...people need to have first hand knowledge of this stuff,otherwise they can just ignore it","p058","p001",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
3882,302,157,22,"Person 1","After that though, how can we motivate action? It's like protesting, once an issue has been made known, and awareness has increased, I wonder what can be done to cause people to demand action, instead of just forgetting about it or moving on to the next topic","p058","p001",2.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
3883,302,157,23,"Person 2","i don't know if there is really anything else to do.... it's a \"lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink\" type of thing....people will either want to change or not","p058","p001",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
3884,302,157,24,"Person 1","Yeah, also there's so many issues in our society that need addressing i think it's hard for people to focus on any one problem.","p058","p001",2,1,1.6667,1.3333

3949,302,160,5,"Person 2","Right? So, it stands to reason that a person suffering from lung cancer would have a lower life expectancy in such a place. Unfortunately, most people can't afford to just move out to the country.","p020","p030",2.3333,2,3,1.6667

3956,302,160,12,"Person 1","that is very true. there is different danger everywhere. so many different things could kill us at anytime. it is just better to not think about it.","p020","p030",2.3333,1,3.3333,2
3957,302,160,13,"Person 2","I think mindfulness is important, but dwelling on destructive things like that turns toxic very quickly. Do you engage in any behaviors that help limit air pollution? I know as individuals we have limited capacities.","p020","p030",2,0.6667,3.3333,2.3333
3958,302,160,14,"Person 1","I work from home so I do not drive my car very often. I recycle. I try not to turn my air conditioner on much in the summer. these are small things but if everybody did something i think it would help.","p020","p030",1.6667,0,2.6667,3

3961,302,160,17,"Person 2","It's nice, but I enjoy seeing everyday people joining the fight just as much. I just recently got my mother into recycling and composting. Her garden has never looked better.","p020","p030",2,0,2.3333,2.6667

3966,375,161,1,"Person 2","I feel like the Polar bears are getting screwed in every way imagineable.  If it isn't one thing getting em, it's another.","p022","p063",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
3967,375,161,2,"Person 1","It's terrible though. Did the article mention what the tourists did to the polar bears?","p022","p063",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
3968,375,161,3,"Person 2","That's what I was wondering too.  Are the tourists actually the ones killing them, or are they getting attacked more, so officials have to kill the bears?","p022","p063",2,1,3.3333,1.6667
3969,375,161,4,"Person 1","It was a pretty short article so i'm not sure. Either way, poor polar bears. :(","p022","p063",2.3333,1.3333,3,1.3333
3970,375,161,5,"Person 2","Yeah it's like, if we're not completely destroying their environment, we're gonna tour into whats left of it, and kill them that way.  Tough life for a Polar Bear.","p022","p063",2.6667,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
3971,375,161,6,"Person 1","How can we help the polar bears? :(","p022","p063",2.3333,1,3,1.6667
3972,375,161,7,"Person 2","I think other than the basics of respecting our environment, and voting in political candidates who would enact policies, I\"m not sure there is much we can do.","p022","p063",2,1,2.6667,2
3973,375,161,8,"Person 1","Maybe the tourists are stealing all of the polar bear's food.","p022","p063",1.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
3974,375,161,9,"Person 2","Lol I hope tourists aren't eating seal pups... I'm sure just the interaction ends with having to kill polar bears. I know that happens frequently where I'll go hiking.  There will be a bear attack, and officials then have to find and kill the bear, otherwise they'll attack more humans.","p022","p063",2,1.3333,3,2.6667
3975,375,161,10,"Person 1","oh no that's terrible! It's not the bear's fault","p022","p063",3.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
3976,375,161,11,"Person 2","No, but I think humans have this innate feeling that the world is ours for the taking.  Not sure how we correct that though.","p022","p063",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
3977,375,161,12,"Person 1","Probably no way. I just feel bad for them. Imagine killing a mother polar bear.. what's going to happen to the babies?! It's all so sad.","p022","p063",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
3978,375,161,13,"Person 2","Yeah.  I watch a lot of BBC nature programs too.  I'm sure a lot of it is edited, but everytime they show footage of polar bears, you're left holding back tears.","p022","p063",2,1,4,2.6667
3979,375,161,14,"Person 1","I don't even hold back my tears. I just bawl because it's so sad. I remember seeing a video where a hawk ate one of the babies.","p022","p063",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,3
3980,375,161,15,"Person 2","Ha, as sad as that is though, that doesn't bug me. Circle of life shit.  That's how nature is supposed to be.  What bugs me is when you see how humans are disrupting the natural cycle of things, and other animals pay for it.","p022","p063",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
3981,375,161,16,"Person 1","That's true. I definitely don't do all that i can to help the environment","p022","p063",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
3982,375,161,17,"Person 2","I've definitely been trying to do more the last several years.  It can get kind of depressing though when you realize what a small impact you can actually have.","p022","p063",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
3983,375,161,18,"Person 1","really? one person can make an impact?","p022","p063",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
3984,375,161,19,"Person 2","I mean, you don't have any other choice in my opinion.  I try to get others to follow suit as well.  Grassroots type stuff.  I also try to ensure that I'm not overbearing about it though, I think that turns people off.","p022","p063",2,0.6667,2.6667,2.6667
3985,375,161,20,"Person 1","I will definitely try to do more in the future. Well it was nice talking to you my friend. bye!","p022","p063",2.3333,0,1.6667,2.3333

3988,375,162,1,"Person 2","it is very wicked and sad","p002","p050",4,2,4,2.3333
3989,375,162,2,"Person 1","I wish there was some type of organization that worked with local authorities of these people to issue fines or punishments.","p002","p050",2.6667,1,2.6667,2
3990,375,162,3,"Person 2","Exactly. The locals can set up some committee though","p002","p050",1.6667,1,2.6667,1
3991,375,162,4,"Person 1","I'm not sure if there are locals where these polar bears are being killed though.","p002","p050",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1
3992,375,162,5,"Person 2","There should...","p002","p050",2,1.3333,1.3333,1
3993,375,162,6,"Person 1","It's hard for me to see the side of a person that kills an animal like this for sport. Does it make them feel good about themselves? Most of the time they're shooting from helicopters and such.","p002","p050",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
3994,375,162,7,"Person 2","It is inhumane. It is some form of entertainment for them","p002","p050",4,2,3,2.3333
3995,375,162,8,"Person 1","Or a power trip I guess. It actually makes me a bit sick to my stomach seeing people post pictures of the kills with themselves smiling on Facebook.","p002","p050",4,2,4,3.3333
3996,375,162,9,"Person 2","I blocked some of my friends that engaged in such. It is totally different if the killing os for survival","p002","p050",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
3997,375,162,10,"Person 1","I can imagine that if more people had to kill the food that they eat their outlooks would be different. Easy for a person to pull a trigger from far away.","p002","p050",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
3998,375,162,11,"Person 2","Its is human wickedness to the planet. Humans are the most selfish","p002","p050",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
3999,375,162,12,"Person 1","Yes a lot humans have evolved into something disgusting. People take pleasure in wicked things. It sucks","p002","p050",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
4000,375,162,13,"Person 2","WHat do you think can be done to protect those animals. They might go into extinction soon","p002","p050",1.6667,1,3.6667,1.3333
4001,375,162,14,"Person 1","More education on the issue to younger kids would help. Steep fines and penalties would deter this as well.","p002","p050",2,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4002,375,162,15,"Person 2","Yeah. I feel proper education for the kids would help. But then, most kids copy their parents","p002","p050",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
4003,375,162,16,"Person 1","If kids were educated I think they would not follow their parents. Probably will take more species going extinct though :(","p002","p050",2.6667,1,3,1.6667
4004,375,162,17,"Person 2","You have a very valid point.","p002","p050",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
4005,375,162,18,"Person 1","People are so removed from nature though that they tune these things out. If it doesn't impact their everyday lives it is easy to ignore.","p002","p050",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
4006,375,162,19,"Person 2","That is sad. Nice talking with you. bye","p002","p050",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667

4008,375,163,0,"Person 1","I wish this article gave more information on the subject.","p058","p041",1,1,1,3
4009,375,163,1,"Person 2","I was thinking the same thing. Based on the information given what do you think?","p058","p041",1,1,1,1
4010,375,163,2,"Person 1","I guess I'm not very surprised. Seems like endangered species are getting wiped out all over the world. I just saw another article about elephants in africa being killed for their ivory.","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4011,375,163,3,"Person 2","Yes I did as well. Also the last known female Yangtze turtle just died. Humanity has to do better","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4012,375,163,4,"Person 1","I'm not very hopeful it will. It's like no one really cares at all about these issues. As long as profits are to be made anyway.","p058","p041",2,2,3,3
4013,375,163,5,"Person 2","I am inclined to agree. Partially. I understand that greed is very powerful, but it is the lowest of all human emotions. I think people can rise above it someday. I hope it's not too late when we do","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4014,375,163,6,"Person 1","That article was lacking so much information. Would be nice to know what steps they are taking to try to protect the bears. I think a video was supposed to be included.","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4015,375,163,7,"Person 2","I agree. I was also wondering how many polar bears were affected. What steps do you think should be taken?","p058","p041",1,1,2,3
4016,375,163,8,"Person 1","I'm not really sure. I mean, if people have legitimate reasons for being there and are in danger of being attacked by a polar bear, they should have the right to defend themselves. But maybe restricting access to the places where these bears are would work? I'm not really sure.","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4017,375,163,9,"Person 2","I doubt anyone has a truly legitimate reason for being that close to polar bear habitats. How do you think conservation efforts as a whole can be improved?","p058","p041",2,1,2,3
4018,375,163,10,"Person 1","I bet the practices they are doing is good, just probably needs more funding. I feel like any kind of \"save the insert animal here\" effort is promoted it doesn't get very much traction, people don't seem to care. Which ultimately will lead to funding problems, they end up cutting corners or not being able to do everything they planned, and more animals die.","p058","p041",3,2,2,3
4019,375,163,11,"Person 2","What makes you think that people don't seem to care?","p058","p041",1,1,1,1
4020,375,163,12,"Person 1","Well, care in the sense that they are motivated to effect change. The news media certainly isn't pushing these stories to the top. I'm sure people care enough to sign a petition or something along those lines, but would they even donate money? Who knows. What do you think about what's being done so far?","p058","p041",2,1,2,3
4021,375,163,13,"Person 2","I think humanity needs to do much more. I agree about the media not focusing on these issues. I think government needs to do much more to protect endangered animals and hold people accountable. Do you think the issue regarding the polar bears in the article may be related to climate change?","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4022,375,163,14,"Person 1","It's certainly possible. At least the warming of the climate effecting polar bears in general, probably not the issue of visitors killing them. You are right the government should be doing more. But that all goes back to people not caring. Listen to any politician speak, they won't say anything about protecting any endangered animals, it's all health care, economy, illegal immigration etc","p058","p041",2,2,3,3
4023,375,163,15,"Person 2","Maybe the polar bears are coming into contact with humans more because their habitat is melting away. The politicians will talk about whatever they think people want to hear. What do you think is a good way to get people to care more about conservation issues?","p058","p041",1,2,2,3
4024,375,163,16,"Person 1","Yeah that certainly is possible. Raising awareness is one area. I didn't know  there were problems with the polar bears in Norway until reading this article. More attention needs to be on these issues. Although, there's so many animals being threatened, do you think we run the risk of flooding people with too much and people being overwhelmed and just ignoring it all?","p058","p041",2,2,3,3
4025,375,163,17,"Person 2","That is certainly a possibility. But too much information is better than too little. What might be some ways to get people more actively involved once awareness has been raised?","p058","p041",2,1,1,3
4026,375,163,18,"Person 1","Petitions, donation drives, contacting politicians and informing them these are issues you care about. I suppose all of those could help. I'm not sure it's enough though.","p058","p041",2,0,1,2
4027,375,163,19,"Person 2","I am sure all these things would be helpful, but I am not convinced it would be enough. I would propose a more hands on approach by taking people to actively patrol conservation zones are at least to a zoo or similar area so they can have some face to face time with these animals. What do you think>","p058","p041",2,0,2,3
4028,375,163,20,"Person 1","Yeah I'm sure that would convince some, but in order for real change, it would require a large number of people to make this an important issue for them. How many people are gonna take off work to go to the zoo lol.","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4029,375,163,21,"Person 2","With sufficient motivation there is nothing stopping what someone will do. The question is how do we get people sufficiently motivated? I would really miss the polar bears when they are all gone","p058","p041",2,2,3,3
4030,375,163,22,"Person 1","If I'm being honest, I don't think I would. In fact, I doubt I'd even notice if it did happen. I've never seen one person, and I don't think they would have any impact on my life. I do believe they should be saved, but in terms of what I would be willing to do to help? Probably not much.","p058","p041",2,2,3,4
4031,375,163,23,"Person 2","Wow. Why wouldn't you be willing to help?","p058","p041",1,1,2,1
4032,375,163,24,"Person 1","What could I do? I could donate money. What else could one person do to have a meaningful impact on polar bears in Norway? Then there's the elephants in Africa, the dolphins are also being killed off in mass, etc etc etc","p058","p041",2,2,3,4
4033,375,163,25,"Person 2","So you feel overwhelmed?","p058","p041",1,1,2,1
4034,375,163,26,"Person 1","Well, not so much overwhelmed, but just that there isn't anything more than just donating money I could realistically do. Unless I wanted to travel to Norway and volunteer with the organization that is tasked with protecting the bears. Which isn't realistic for me.","p058","p041",2,2,2,3
4035,375,163,27,"Person 2","What could be some other realistic ways for you to get involved beside donating money?","p058","p041",1,1,3,1
4036,375,163,28,"Person 1","That's the thing, I can't really think of any.","p058","p041",1,1,2,2
4037,375,163,29,"Person 2","There has to be some interesting way you can make a contribution outside of giving a donation","p058","p041",2,1,1,1
4038,375,163,30,"Person 1","Do you have any ideas?","p058","p041",1,1,1,1
4039,375,163,31,"Person 2","I mentioned them already. I would rather not suggest anything punitive like fines or taxes","p058","p041",2,1,1,2
4040,375,163,32,"Person 1","Yeah, I don't think people would agree with more taxes anyway.","p058","p041",1,1,1,2
4041,375,163,33,"Person 2","I am trying to think of something like earth day where some people plant trees. That is a great conservationist effort","p058","p041",2,1,2,2
4042,375,163,34,"Person 1","Yeah, that could be a good way to raise awareness at least. Well, I enjoyed this conversation with you. goodbye","p058","p041",2,1,2,2
4043,375,163,35,"Person 2","bye","p058","p041",0,1,0,1

4045,375,164,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I really wish the article had more details though.","p024","p043",1.3333,1,2.6667,2
4046,375,164,2,"Person 1","it seemed to be too short and doesnt say what the visitors do to the bears","p024","p043",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
4047,375,164,3,"Person 2","Yup, the way it was written, I assumed it was a poacher situation.","p024","p043",1,0.6667,2,1.6667
4048,375,164,4,"Person 1","yeah to me it seemed that way too","p024","p043",1,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
4049,375,164,5,"Person 2","It also would've been nice to see how much the polar bear numbers are declining because of the visitors.","p024","p043",1.3333,1,2,2
4050,375,164,6,"Person 1","just another reason why the article is just not a good one","p024","p043",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
4051,375,164,7,"Person 2","Yup, it reminded me of a terrible newspaper article written to fill space.","p024","p043",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
4052,375,164,8,"Person 1","if journalism is that easy I think I might give it a go.","p024","p043",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
4053,375,164,9,"Person 2","Lol, not so fast. It's pretty much a dead profession with all the papers going bankrupt. Although I guess you could write internet pieces.","p024","p043",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
4054,375,164,10,"Person 1","True gone are the days of getting the news through newspapers lol","p024","p043",2,0.3333,2,1.3333
4055,375,164,11,"Person 2","Yeah, now it's all about reading breaking stories on twitter and other social media.","p024","p043",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
4056,375,164,12,"Person 1","yeah people dont even read the articles they just read the tweet headline and comment on it lol","p024","p043",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4057,375,164,13,"Person 2","Yeah ands sometimes the article titles are misleading, only to generate interest in an article on a different website.","p024","p043",1.6667,1,2,2
4058,375,164,14,"Person 1","Back to the bears I feel we as people should find ways to stop this.","p024","p043",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
4059,375,164,15,"Person 2","Do you think it meant visitors as in tourists? Or maybe people moving to areas that previously were wilderness?","p024","p043",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667

4061,375,164,17,"Person 2","Probably. I guess their furs would be valuable. I agree that something really needs to be done about this.","p024","p043",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
4062,375,164,18,"Person 1","I assume there is a monetary reason as to why they are doing this. Money is the root of all evil.","p024","p043",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
4063,375,164,19,"Person 2","Yeah, everything corruptable about humans usually comes down to money. People need to value nature more than money, especially since we are losing different species of animals and plant life every couple years. It was nice talking to you.","p024","p043",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
4064,375,164,20,"Person 1","Money comes and goes, creatures like polar bears do not. bye","p024","p043",2,1,2.3333,2
4065,375,164,21,"Person 2","Yup. bye","p024","p043",1.3333,0.6667,1,1
4066,375,165,0,"Person 1","I feel bad for the polar bears","p035","p062",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
4067,375,165,1,"Person 2","I'm curious how they're dying.  Are people hunting them or are their habitats being affected.","p035","p062",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
4068,375,165,2,"Person 1","The article did not have a lot of information.","p035","p062",1,1,2,1
4069,375,165,3,"Person 2","No, it sure didn't.  But yeah, it seems ridiculous that people are going up there, possibly to enjoy the polar bears, and they're dying as a result.","p035","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
4070,375,165,4,"Person 1","I do not think polar bears are going to make it.","p035","p062",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
4071,375,165,5,"Person 2","They're in pretty bad trouble, for sure.  We'll see if their behavior changes in their changing environment.","p035","p062",2.3333,1.6667,4,1.6667
4072,375,165,6,"Person 1","I hope their behavior changes, but with the ice melting, I think it is too late.","p035","p062",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
4073,375,165,7,"Person 2","It definitely could be. And the arctic isn't a very friendly place to try to figure out where to get more food.","p035","p062",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
4074,375,165,8,"Person 1","Don't plenty of zoos have polar bears for people to see?","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
4075,375,165,9,"Person 2","Yes, but I suppose people want to see them in the wild.  Have you ever seen a polar bear in person?","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
4076,375,165,10,"Person 1","Yes, at the Toledo Zoo","p035","p062",1.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
4077,375,165,11,"Person 2","I've seen them too.  They look cuddly and friendly but of course they're not.","p035","p062",2,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
4078,375,165,12,"Person 1","Yeah, Coke made them cuddly","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,3,1.6667
4079,375,165,13,"Person 2","Indeed.  It'll be shocking if such a big, familiar animal goes extinct in our lifetime.  I suppose they won't because of the zoos.  But they might disappear from the wild.","p035","p062",2.3333,1,3.3333,2
4080,375,165,14,"Person 1","I agree, but sadly we have to worry about humans at the rate we are going with climate change.","p035","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
4081,375,165,15,"Person 2","I think some humans.  But we're like cockroaches.  I think we'll find a way to survive.  Or most of us will.","p035","p062",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
4082,375,165,16,"Person 1","I hope so","p035","p062",1.6667,0,1.6667,2
4083,375,165,17,"Person 2","I sort of feel like we'll get what we deserve.  If we deserve to suffer from our treatment of the environment, we will.","p035","p062",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.6667
4084,375,165,18,"Person 1","I agree, no animal on earth last forever.","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
4085,375,165,19,"Person 2","Yeah, that's another perspective.  Bears and humans have NOT existed for far, far, far more of earth's history than they have.  We tend to view the present as the way things are supposed to be.  But they're not.  That's just our narrow perspective.","p035","p062",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
4086,375,165,20,"Person 1","I agree, dinosaurs had a much longer run.","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4087,375,165,21,"Person 2","And are much more interesting.  Maybe one day some other species will study how we died out.","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4088,375,165,22,"Person 1","odds are laugh at how greedy we were.","p035","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
4089,375,165,23,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm sure they'd find plenty to be disgusted by.  Heck, people already do.","p035","p062",2.3333,1,1.3333,2
4090,375,165,24,"Person 1","Do you think we can change?","p035","p062",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
4091,375,165,25,"Person 2","No.  I think we're animals and we act this way because it's in our blood.","p035","p062",2,1,2,2.3333
4092,375,165,26,"Person 1","Sadly I agree","p035","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4093,375,165,27,"Person 2","Any other thoughts on this topic?","p035","p062",1,0.6667,1,1
4094,375,165,28,"Person 1","can't think of any, bye","p035","p062",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
4095,375,165,29,"Person 2","bye","p035","p062",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
4126,228,167,0,"Person 1","It's hard for me to understand how a parent could send their kids off to a situation like this.","p002","p062",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
4127,228,167,1,"Person 2","I agree.  But I think they feel they need their children to earn income to support the family.  How about stop having kids.","p002","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
4128,228,167,2,"Person 1","If the job is available for the kid to work then the parents could work the same job. They are sacrificing the kids potential future for minimal payments.","p002","p062",2.6667,1.3333,3,2
4129,228,167,3,"Person 2","It's definitely sad.  In this situation there seems to be no shortage of blame to go around.  Parents, slave-owners, authorities.","p002","p062",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
4130,228,167,4,"Person 1","Hard to even know where to start. Better wages for normal jobs would help parents to not face this decision.","p002","p062",2,1.6667,3,2.3333
4131,228,167,5,"Person 2","That's probably part of it, although I don't know much about the Burmese economy.  But overpopulation is a big problem, too.  And corrupt governments.","p002","p062",1.6667,2,2,2
4132,228,167,6,"Person 1","Yes overpopulation is definitely a problem that will continue to get worse. Hard to stop nature though.","p002","p062",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
4133,228,167,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it's situations like this that help you appreciate how similar we are to animals.  Most of what we do isn't driven by reason.","p002","p062",2.3333,1,2,2
4134,228,167,8,"Person 1","Logic and emotions don't mix haha. I think China had the right idea with limiting their population and now that seems to be removed. Resources are not infinite imo.","p002","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
4135,228,167,9,"Person 2","It's interesting how it works though.  Western countries aren't having kids at rates fast enough to replinish the population.  So it's immigrants from less-civilized nations growing the population.  In other words, an irony: the people who can't sustain themselves (as well) are the ones growing the population.","p002","p062",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
4136,228,167,10,"Person 1","And the people who are in positions to utilize this growth are against immigration. Could help everybody if we just worked together.","p002","p062",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
4137,228,167,11,"Person 2","Yes, but that's probably been true since the beginning of humanity.","p002","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
4138,228,167,12,"Person 1","It sucks that there is so little that people outside of the country experiencing the child labor can do to help solve the problem.","p002","p062",3,1.3333,2.6667,2
4139,228,167,13,"Person 2","Yeah.  I guess it's just got to be a grass roots thing where citizens say their countries aren't going to act that way anymore, and it trickles up into authority and the governments themselves.","p002","p062",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
4140,228,167,14,"Person 1","I think that government actions from foreign nations could help. Embargoes placed until countries do something but this is hard to see happening.","p002","p062",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4141,228,167,15,"Person 2","Yeah, that would probably help.  But it's a logistical nightmare.  Can countries like the U.S. and E.U. really \"police\" this stuff and monitor it enough to truly make a difference.  Look at this story.  What was the result of an international agency getting involved.  They PAID OFF the guy who enslaved the kids.  In other words, they ENCOURAGED him to do it again.  (Admittedly, he was later arrested.)  But we have to be careful about HOW we intervene, not just that we do.","p002","p062",3,2,2.6667,2.6667
4142,228,167,16,"Person 1","Did they pay him off? I thought the kids were compensated not the business.","p002","p062",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
4143,228,167,17,"Person 2","No, they paid for the children's release.  That's how I read it.","p002","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
4144,228,167,18,"Person 1","I remember seeing that the girls were paid 4,000 as back-pay as well. Definitely a logistical nightmare though. People are too afraid to offend the host countries I'd assume.","p002","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
4145,228,167,19,"Person 2","That's another part of it.  There's always some attempt to respect the sovereignty of nations.  But at what point do you intervene because you believe you know better.","p002","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
4146,228,167,20,"Person 1","True. Either you want the USA to be world police or not. Hard to find the balance! Nice chatting to you about this though. bye","p002","p062",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
4147,228,167,21,"Person 2","Yes, I enjoyed the chat.  Thank you.  bye","p002","p062",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1
4148,228,168,0,"Person 1","What do you think about the article?","p005","p024",1,0.5,1.6667,1
4149,228,168,1,"Person 2","I thought it was terribly deppressing what these children had to go through","p005","p024",3.6667,1,4.3333,2
4150,228,168,2,"Person 1","I feel so sad about it","p005","p024",3.3333,2,3,2
4151,228,168,3,"Person 2","Yeah its just disgusting","p005","p024",4,2,5,2
4152,228,168,4,"Person 1","It was so terrible and to think the police was not helping","p005","p024",3.6667,2,5,2
4153,228,168,5,"Person 2","What do you think should be done","p005","p024",1.3333,0.5,2.3333,1
4154,228,168,6,"Person 1","I think appropriate punishment should be given","p005","p024",2,0.5,2.3333,2
4155,228,168,7,"Person 2","no doubt about it.","p005","p024",2,0.5,2.3333,1.3333
4156,228,168,8,"Person 1","What do you think as well?","p005","p024",1,0.5,2.3333,1
4157,228,168,9,"Person 2","i think capital punishment should be given","p005","p024",2.6667,1,3,2.3333
4158,228,168,10,"Person 1","i support that too","p005","p024",2,0.5,2.6667,2.3333
4159,228,168,11,"Person 2","i think everyone supports that","p005","p024",2,0.5,1.6667,1.6667
4160,228,168,12,"Person 1","That is right, what do you think about Swen Win?","p005","p024",1.6667,0.5,1.6667,1
4161,228,168,13,"Person 2","she has great heart for getting involved","p005","p024",2.6667,0,2.3333,1.6667
4162,228,168,14,"Person 1","Yes she was the hero of the story","p005","p024",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.6667
4163,228,168,15,"Person 2","yeah thats when things started to move when she got involved","p005","p024",1.6667,0,2,1.3333
4164,228,168,16,"Person 1","I really applauded her","p005","p024",2.3333,0,2.6667,2
4165,228,168,17,"Person 2","if she never got involved nothing wouldve happened","p005","p024",1.6667,0.5,2.6667,1.3333
4166,228,168,18,"Person 1","I really do not want to think about that","p005","p024",3,0.5,2.6667,2
4167,228,168,19,"Person 2","good thing it didnt go that way. its been a good talk. bye.","p005","p024",2.3333,0,1.6667,1
4168,228,168,20,"Person 1","I need to tell you first.... goodbye","p005","p024",1.6667,0.5,1,1
4169,228,169,0,"Person 1","I would have believed that there were abuses of human rights going on in situations like this, but holy crap, the accusations of the broken fingers and stuff is infuriating.","p063","p035",4.6667,2,4.3333,2
4170,228,169,1,"Person 2","The world is a crazy place, I feel bad for the girls and their families.","p063","p035",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
4171,228,169,2,"Person 1","yeah, women still have it pretty tough in other places of the world.","p063","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
4172,228,169,3,"Person 2","Sadly, odds are they are sexually abusing them too.","p063","p035",2.6667,2,3,1.3333
4173,228,169,4,"Person 1","Oh for sure.  I wonder if the families know that that's inevitable when they send their children to do this.","p063","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
4174,228,169,5,"Person 2","I don't think they have a choice since they are so poor","p063","p035",1.3333,2,2.6667,2
4175,228,169,6,"Person 1","Yeah, but I wonder if there's hope that they'll land in a good place, and prosper?","p063","p035",2,1,3.3333,2
4176,228,169,7,"Person 2","I think they have the hope, but they still might know the danger too. I could see myself sending my daughters away","p063","p035",2,1,3.3333,2.3333
4177,228,169,8,"Person 1","Oo I guess I could understand that.  It's easy for us to say here in America, assuming that's where you're from, that we wouldn't do that.","p063","p035",2,0.6667,3,2
4178,228,169,9,"Person 2","Yeah, I am in America I think most American have no clue how the rest of the world is living.","p063","p035",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
4179,228,169,10,"Person 1","That's kind of why I think travel is extremely important.  If you have the means to travel, you owe it to yourself to get out and see the world, see how other people live their life, and hopefully understand that there is more to this earth than your little bubble.","p063","p035",2.6667,0.3333,3.6667,2.3333
4180,228,169,11,"Person 2","I do think of the or people have the upper hand is some major event happened to the earth. I do not know how to hunt or grow crops so I would be dead pretty quick","p063","p035",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
4181,228,169,12,"Person 1","Lol, oh yeah we've become incredibly reliant on tech.  If that was yanked from under our feet, and we had to go back to working the earth, we're f'd.","p063","p035",3,1,2.3333,1.6667
4182,228,169,13,"Person 2","I wonder why the police would not help the girls at first?","p063","p035",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
4183,228,169,14,"Person 1","I'm sure accusations like this occur all the time.  Maybe the police brush it off regularly?  The difference might have been that international journalists got involved.","p063","p035",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
4184,228,169,15,"Person 2","Have you been to other countries? I have only been to Canada","p063","p035",1,0.6667,1,2
4185,228,169,16,"Person 1","Yeah I've been to several.  Italy, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Eleuthera.","p063","p035",1,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
4186,228,169,17,"Person 2","How were the local people living?","p063","p035",1,0.6667,1.6667,1
4187,228,169,18,"Person 1","In the last three it was pretty dismal compared to here.  Thing was though, they seemed happier.  It's funny how wealth doesn't really buy happiness.","p063","p035",2,1,3,2
4188,228,169,19,"Person 2","I always say you don't miss what you don't know.","p063","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4189,228,169,20,"Person 1","Yeah, and the simple things that they do have gives them a lot of joy.  I played some basketball in Eleuthera, and they were freaking having a blast trying to dunk on the white boy.","p063","p035",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,3
4190,228,169,21,"Person 2","any other thoughts on the article?","p063","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1,1
4191,228,169,22,"Person 1","Nah, just sucks to hear that this is still common for such a large people group.","p063","p035",2.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
4192,228,169,23,"Person 2","I agree with you. It was nice chatting with you! bye","p063","p035",2,0.3333,1,1.3333

4194,228,170,0,"Person 1","How disturbing that these young girls were enslaved, how does this article make you feel?","p041","p001",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
4195,228,170,1,"Person 2","makes me feel horrible to think that there are things like this going on in the world","p041","p001",4,2,4.3333,2
4196,228,170,2,"Person 1","They were robbed of their innocence. When I think about how their parents sent them to this tailor I get angry. How could you do that as parents?","p041","p001",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
4197,228,170,3,"Person 2","yea i know..i mean,i understand that they are poor but come on,that's a crazy \"excuse\"","p041","p001",3.3333,2,3,2
4198,228,170,4,"Person 1","Being poor is no excuse in my opinion. What's even worse is that they were physically abused","p041","p001",4,2,3.3333,2
4199,228,170,5,"Person 2","right,you already made these poor girls slaves,couldn't they have at least been treated well? i hope there are no lasting psychological effects","p041","p001",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
4200,228,170,6,"Person 1","Of course they will be. What a shame that the authorities only intervened after international headlines popped up","p041","p001",3.3333,1.6667,3,2
4201,228,170,7,"Person 2","i wonder how many are still going through this","p041","p001",1.6667,1.3333,3.3333,1.3333
4202,228,170,8,"Person 1","probably thousands. the question is how does an organization like the UN step in to stop these atrocities?","p041","p001",1.6667,1,3,2
4203,228,170,9,"Person 2","i suppose they could try a big educational type of campaign..maybe form some volunteer groups in the country,but without out help from the local authorities/government there isn't much they can do","p041","p001",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
4204,228,170,10,"Person 1","I was wondering how the UN might put pressure on the Burmese government to correct this. Sanctions perhaps? Or maybe an intervention force?","p041","p001",1,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
4205,228,170,11,"Person 2","sanctions are probably the best bet i'd think","p041","p001",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
4206,228,170,12,"Person 1","How effective would they be? How quickly would sanctions work?","p041","p001",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
4207,228,170,13,"Person 2","well,i guess depends on what exactly is being sanctioned....i know they export a decent amount of petroleum gas...so that would be a good starting point","p041","p001",1.3333,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
4208,228,170,14,"Person 1","That seems like a great place to start. So many adults were complicit. It must be a cultural issue there to devalue a child's life","p041","p001",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
4209,228,170,15,"Person 2","that's the tough part,how do you get to them to stop doing something that's seemingly culturally accepted","p041","p001",2,1,3.3333,1.6667
4210,228,170,16,"Person 1","Education I suppose. I think the practice is considered tolerable because the victims are poor. It's hard to teach someone that all human beings are equal when they live so differently","p041","p001",1.6667,0.6667,3.3333,2
4211,228,170,17,"Person 2","yea,kind of depressing since them being poor is unlikely to change..education can only do so much when they are doing it for money","p041","p001",2.3333,1.3333,3,1.6667
4212,228,170,18,"Person 1","Lol how can someone be educated to love their own children more than they love money. This is why I think the international community has do more to prevent this kind of exploitation of young innocent children","p041","p001",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
4213,228,170,19,"Person 2","right,exactly...but besides sanctions what do you think the international community can do?","p041","p001",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
4214,228,170,20,"Person 1","Some kind of peace keeping force to patrol the areas most likely to be affected by this kind of human trafficking? what do you think?","p041","p001",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
4215,228,170,21,"Person 2","that would be helpful,but i doubt the myanmar's government would allow those optics","p041","p001",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4216,228,170,22,"Person 1","They would if there were sufficiently many members of the international community behind the idea. Without some serious intervention and consequences this ugly practice will continue, I mean just look at our own history. It took the Civil War to end slavery, without it who knows how long slavery would have lasted","p041","p001",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
4217,228,170,23,"Person 2","maybe even use sanctions as leverage if they refuse","p041","p001",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
4218,228,170,24,"Person 1","That sounds like a plan. Between sanctions and a peacekeeping force they would have no choice but to agree. But it can't be that simple because the human trafficking is ongoing. What have we overlooked in this situation?","p041","p001",2,1,2.3333,2
4219,228,170,25,"Person 2","i don't think we overlooked anything really....it's just getting all these things to align properly i think.","p041","p001",1.3333,0.6667,2,2
4220,228,170,26,"Person 1","Or maybe the international community are not all on board. If that's true I wonder why that might be?","p041","p001",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
4221,228,170,27,"Person 2","Myanmar has a fair bit of geopolitical importance,i guess there could be some fear of losing the government as an asset","p041","p001",1,1,2.3333,1.6667
4222,228,170,28,"Person 1","You may very well be right. Greed strikes again","p041","p001",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
4223,228,170,29,"Person 2","it always comes back to it....from the parents,the traffickers,the international community,the local government.....geez","p041","p001",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
4224,228,170,30,"Person 1","It has been an interesting conversation, goodbye","p041","p001",1.6667,0.6667,1,1
4225,228,170,31,"Person 2","yea,very interesting chat,bye!","p041","p001",2,0.3333,1,1
4226,400,171,0,"Person 1","I thought this was rather sad just because it was the loss of an innocent life and a baby at that.  I don't know much about rhinos really.","p029","p062",3.3333,2,4,2
4227,400,171,1,"Person 2","Yes, I assume the baby was orphaned from poaching, although I'm just assuming that.","p029","p062",1.3333,1.3333,3,2
4228,400,171,2,"Person 1","Yeah I kinda assumed the same which adds an extra level of sadness to it","p029","p062",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
4229,400,171,3,"Person 2","Yes, poaching seems brutal and unnecessary, although the people doing it would argue it's their livelihood, I suppose.  But I still find it sad.","p029","p062",3.3333,2,3,2
4230,400,171,4,"Person 1","Yeah I totally agree.  I also don't know much about it but it does seem brutal and unnecessary to me.  I am not sure that they even use all the parts of the animals they kill.  I think not.","p029","p062",3,1.6667,3.3333,2
4231,400,171,5,"Person 2","Right, I think they just use the horns.   Or sell them.  These people who treat the orphaned animals must have a hard time with it.  True, there are probably success stories where they nurse them back to health and find them homes, but when they see these animals the first time they're always in a bad place.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3,2
4232,400,171,6,"Person 1","Yeah I am sure they form an attachment to the little animals and it is very sad to lose one.  I mean they have named them and everything.","p029","p062",3,2,3.6667,2
4233,400,171,7,"Person 2","Yeah, that's a good point about naming them.  They aren't just creatures at that point.  They're little personalities.","p029","p062",2.3333,0.6667,3.3333,2
4234,400,171,8,"Person 1","Yeah exactly almost like a pet or something.  They didn't give much detail in the article so a little more information would have helped, like some background info maybe.","p029","p062",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
4235,400,171,9,"Person 2","Yes, I agree.  I wondered what type of suffering the animal had been through.  Maybe just starving or something.  Or maybe injured.  But there weren't many details for sure.","p029","p062",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4236,400,171,10,"Person 1","Yeah, like why did it not survive?  They really didn't touch on any of that.  What is the overall survival rate for these orphaned rhinos?  It mentioned it was a special orphanage just for them, right?","p029","p062",1.3333,1.6667,3,1.3333
4237,400,171,11,"Person 2","Yes, I believe so.  Have you ever seen a rhino in person?  They're remarkable creatures.  Like living tanks or something.  The closest thing to dinosaurs still around, I suppose.","p029","p062",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
4238,400,171,12,"Person 1","I remember seeing one at the zoo when I was a child.  I don't think I have since then.  That's a neat comparison as far as dinosaurs, I could see that resemblance.  Makes me want to go to a zoo!","p029","p062",1.6667,0,2,2.3333
4239,400,171,13,"Person 2","Uh huh.  I've seen them a couple times.  Rhinos and hippos always fascinate me.  Just seems such a waste to kill them, especially for a trinket.","p029","p062",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
4240,400,171,14,"Person 1","Yeah you are right!  Like the horns.  It truly is a waste.","p029","p062",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
4241,400,171,15,"Person 2","I guess these people working with the orphaned animals probably feel it's about all they can do for the cause.  I'm not sure what else people can do to influence poaching in a meaningful way.","p029","p062",1.6667,1.6667,3,2
4242,400,171,16,"Person 1","Yeah that's a good point, too.  It must be some pretty dedicated and caring people who do this.  I wonder who funds the whole orphanage operation.","p029","p062",1.6667,0.3333,3,2
4243,400,171,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm not sure.  I assume they're non-profit organizations, or affiliated with animal welfare groups/programs.  I assume at higher levels these organizations lobby countries to crack down harder on poaching, but of course there's money involved, so there's corruption, and these are sovereign nations anyway, so outsiders can only exert so much influence.","p029","p062",1.6667,1,3.3333,2.3333
4244,400,171,18,"Person 1","Yeah, certainly there must be politics involved.  The whole scene seems very sad.  I am glad some individuals and groups are trying to do something about it, though.  It has been nice discussing this with you, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Have a great afternoon.  goodbye!","p029","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
4245,400,171,19,"Person 2","Yes, it was nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p029","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1,1
4246,400,172,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about baby rhinos?","p030","p055",0.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
4247,400,172,1,"Person 2","I love animals. I was just heartbroken to hear that sad story.","p030","p055",3.6667,1.3333,4,2.3333
4248,400,172,2,"Person 1","Me too. I wish they would have included more details. The whole thing was very vague. Did the rhino die because of the lack of power?","p030","p055",2,1,3,2
4249,400,172,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I wanted to know more as well. I think from what they said she was an orphaned rhino and I guess the place they took her didn't have a lot of support in place and she needed a lot of help is sounded like. I definitely wanted to know more details.","p030","p055",1.6667,1,3,2.6667
4250,400,172,4,"Person 1","It was really touching how the person spoke about the rhino, almost as if it were their very own child.","p030","p055",3.3333,1,3.6667,2.3333
4251,400,172,5,"Person 2","Yes, that was part of what made it so heartbreaking. They were obviously very invested in doing all they could for her. I wish I knew if that was some sanctuary or organization that is trying to help rhinos so that money could be raised to improve conditions so that perhaps they could save more babies.","p030","p055",3.6667,1,4.6667,3
4252,400,172,6,"Person 1","Yeah, that's part of the reason why the brevity of the article was so frustrating. I'm sure that poaching leaves an inordinate amount of orphaned creatures.","p030","p055",3.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
4253,400,172,7,"Person 2","I'm sure it does. Both wounded and abandoned. I just felt like I was getting only one tiny piece and I wanted to know so much more.","p030","p055",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
4254,400,172,8,"Person 1","Do you have any experience with animals? Pets or otherwise?","p030","p055",0.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
4255,400,172,9,"Person 2","I've grown up around animals all my life. Horses, cows, chickens, ducks, dogs, cats, goats, pigs. Pretty much you name it and I've had a hand in raising it while growing up. I currently have two dogs of my own. Any animal suffering story really hits me hard. I'm a huge animal lover.","p030","p055",3.6667,1,3.6667,3.6667
4256,400,172,10,"Person 1","I came up similarly. My grandparents had a ranch and all the wildlife that comes with it. Do you believe that animals deserve the same rights as humans?","p030","p055",2,0.6667,3,2.6667
4257,400,172,11,"Person 2","I totally do. They have just as much right to life and be protected as humans. We can both share this planet and by taking care of animals we do our part to keep the balance in nature.","p030","p055",3.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2.6667
4258,400,172,12,"Person 1","I completely agree. Animals are often more loyal and loving than most humans. We need them more than we care to admit as a species and that's not just mammals, birds and insects are an important part of the equation also.","p030","p055",3,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4259,400,172,13,"Person 2","I couldn't agree more. My dogs are part of my family. I can't imagine treating animals with less respect than another human, as you say they are often more deserving of compassion than some people. Even those animals we raised for food, we treated them with care and respect. That's how it should be. Do onto others applies to animals the same as people in my mind.","p030","p055",3.6667,0.6667,2.6667,3.6667
4260,400,172,14,"Person 1","My family spoils their dogs rotten. I don't think they could be happier with their position in life, and that makes me glad. I volunteer as a foster pet parent and developing a bond of trust with a troubled pup is one of the most rewarding things. What kind of dogs do you have?","p030","p055",2.6667,0,2,3.3333
4261,400,172,15,"Person 2","I would love to foster, but I get so attached so easily I'd never want to give them up. Ours are spoiled as well, they run the house more than we do. I have a yellow lab and a lab/german shorthair mix.","p030","p055",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.6667
4262,400,172,16,"Person 1","Yeah, it's really hard to let them go. I'm reassured by knowing that they are being sent to a happy home where they will be loved and cared for.","p030","p055",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
4263,400,172,17,"Person 2","Yes, even knowing that in the end I'm giving another family a chance to have that special relationship with a dog. Bringing all that love into a new family would be wonderful but still so hard. I'm so glad there are people like you that can give that to new families and animals, it's such a rewarding and amazing thing.","p030","p055",3.3333,0,2.6667,3
4264,400,172,18,"Person 1","It really is! Thanks so much for chatting today. It was really pleasant (^_^) bye","p030","p055",2.6667,0,0.6667,1.3333
4265,400,172,19,"Person 2","I had a nice time chatting with you as well. goodbye","p030","p055",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
4266,400,173,0,"Person 1","How did you feel after reading the story?","p041","p043",0.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
4267,400,173,1,"Person 2","It was sad, especially since it might've been a protected species of rhino.","p041","p043",2.3333,2,3.6667,1.6667
4268,400,173,2,"Person 1","I was confused about that since an orphanage was mentioned. I was not sure whether it was a child or a rhino","p041","p043",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
4269,400,173,3,"Person 2","I think it was some kind of animal sanctuary. Probably in a poor place too, as they didn't have power in their facility.","p041","p043",1.6667,2,2.6667,1
4270,400,173,4,"Person 1","That does not sound like much of a sanctuary. Why would rhinos need power anyway?","p041","p043",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
4271,400,173,5,"Person 2","I guess for heating? The person in the article was trying to wrap the baby rhino with blankets to keep its body temperature high. Also power would help with treating these animals.","p041","p043",1.3333,0.6667,3,1.3333
4272,400,173,6,"Person 1","What kind of treatment do you think they need?","p041","p043",0.6667,0.6667,2,1
4273,400,173,7,"Person 2","I'm not sure, as the article didn't go that in depth. The baby rhino probably could've been saved from whatever it was ailing from. Whatever it was, it killed the rhino after it fought for life for 48+ hours.","p041","p043",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
4274,400,173,8,"Person 1","What do you think the cause of death was?","p041","p043",0.6667,1,1.6667,1
4275,400,173,9,"Person 2","I haven't the slightest idea. Maybe some kind of rare disease?","p041","p043",1,0.6667,2,1.3333
4276,400,173,10,"Person 1","I was thinking disease as well. Most infant animals die from disease if not predation. How old do you think the rhino was?","p041","p043",1,1,2.3333,1.6667
4277,400,173,11,"Person 2","I think it was really young, I don't quite remember specifics though. I think it had a 2 in there, so either 2 days/months/years old.","p041","p043",1,1,1.6667,1.3333
4278,400,173,12,"Person 1","What do you think a baby rhino smells like?","p041","p043",0.6667,0.6667,2,1
4279,400,173,13,"Person 2","Probably a bit more musty than what a human baby smells like. What do you think? Also rhino's are such cool creatures, I remember seeing them at the Philly zoo. Have you ever seen one in person?","p041","p043",2,0.3333,2.6667,2.6667
4280,400,173,14,"Person 1","No I have never seen one in person. It pains me to think of all the poaching they are at risk for","p041","p043",3,1.3333,2,2.3333
4281,400,173,15,"Person 2","Yup, poaching semi-defenseless animals is such a disgusting thing. The only plus side is that I think rhinos grow their horn back if it's damaged or cut off by poachers.","p041","p043",3,2,3,2.3333
4282,400,173,16,"Person 1","I did not know that. I think that is what they are mainly poached for. If they do grow it back, why not farm them instead?","p041","p043",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
4283,400,173,17,"Person 2","I think it's an ethical thing. Also most people have no use for rhino horns. It's only Asian medicine techniques that require them for good health or whatever.","p041","p043",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
4284,400,173,18,"Person 1","Yes Asia is the main market, which is why the horns are so valuable. I am sure scientist have established that there are no benefits from rhino horns but people still believe in fairy tales.... and rhinos still get poached","p041","p043",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
4285,400,173,19,"Person 2","Yeah, it's a really unfortunate situation. Hopefully younger people in those areas grow up with more appreciation towards exotic animals and no longer purchase these kinds of things. It was nice talking to you.","p041","p043",3,1.3333,2.6667,2
4286,400,173,20,"Person 1","I agree hopefully the internet can help educate and create awareness. I am still wondering how a rhino can become orphaned? What do you think?","p041","p043",1.6667,0.6667,3,2
4287,400,173,21,"Person 2","I guess the easiest way would be if poachers killed the mother/father rhino. Do you know if father rhinos care for the young rhinos too?","p041","p043",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
4288,400,173,22,"Person 1","No I don't, but I don't expect that they do. In most mammals the females exclusively raise the young. I wonder how they orphans are discovered initially?","p041","p043",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
4289,400,173,23,"Person 2","I guess some people must've stumbled on the young rhino. Similar to when kittens and puppies are sent to shelters. Also the rhino might've not been orphaned, it could've just been born in the animal sanctuary.","p041","p043",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
4290,400,173,24,"Person 1","That makes sense. How long do you think a baby rhino can last in the wild without its mother?","p041","p043",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1
4291,400,173,25,"Person 2","They are herbivores, so they don't need to \"hunt\" for food like other meat eaters. So they would have sustenance, it's just a matter of surviving other predators until they are tough enough to protect themselves. I don't think many young animals survive without their mothers.","p041","p043",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
4292,400,173,26,"Person 1","Yeah I was wondering how long they would be able to avoid predators. Without their mothers they are pretty much defenseless. I would really like to see one in person they seem like majestic creatures. Do they have good temperaments??","p041","p043",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
4293,400,173,27,"Person 2","They are wild animals, so I imagine they would be unpredictable. If you don't intrude on their space, I don't think they would attack you needlessly.","p041","p043",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
4294,400,173,28,"Person 1","They seem aggressive to me, why else would they have that huge horn?","p041","p043",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
4295,400,173,29,"Person 2","I guess for defense mostly, since they don't even eat meat. Also maybe as a way of getting mates somehow? Anyway, it was nice talking to you. bye","p041","p043",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
4296,400,173,30,"Person 1","goodbye","p041","p043",1,0.6667,1,1
4297,400,174,0,"Person 1","that is a sad situation","p024","p050",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
4298,400,174,1,"Person 2","It is really sad...at such a tender age?","p024","p050",3,2,3,1.3333
4299,400,174,2,"Person 1","yeah what do you think happened the article didnt say much","p024","p050",1,1.3333,1.6667,1
4300,400,174,3,"Person 2","I really cant figure it out. I feel so terrible for the parent though","p024","p050",3.3333,2,3,1.6667
4301,400,174,4,"Person 1","did the article say where the parent was?","p024","p050",1,1.3333,1,1
4302,400,174,5,"Person 2","No they dont. Did you see anything of such nature?","p024","p050",1,1,1,1
4303,400,174,6,"Person 1","not really the article was missing a lot of key stuff","p024","p050",1,1,1.3333,1
4304,400,174,7,"Person 2","Exactly. How do you think child motality can be reduced?","p024","p050",1,1,2.3333,1
4305,400,174,8,"Person 1","probably have power running in the orphanage for a start","p024","p050",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
4306,400,174,9,"Person 2","Yeah. That will be a great start","p024","p050",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333
4307,400,174,10,"Person 1","what do you think can be done?","p024","p050",0.6667,1,1,1
4308,400,174,11,"Person 2","Well I feel its natural, when its bound to happen, no one can stop it. We have one of the best health institutions in the world IMO","p024","p050",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
4309,400,174,12,"Person 1","i agree","p024","p050",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
4310,400,174,13,"Person 2","I cant imagine losing a kid...","p024","p050",3.6667,2,2.3333,2
4311,400,174,14,"Person 1","its too tough to think about","p024","p050",3.6667,2,2,1.6667
4312,400,174,15,"Person 2","Have you ever lost someone close to you?","p024","p050",1,1,1.6667,1
4313,400,174,16,"Person 1","not yet but it unfortunately will happen to all of us at one point..","p024","p050",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
4314,400,174,17,"Person 2","Hmmnnnn..that is true","p024","p050",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1
4315,400,174,18,"Person 1","yeah scary stuff","p024","p050",2.6667,2,1,1.3333
4316,400,174,19,"Person 2","I feel the parents should join a support group","p024","p050",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
4317,400,174,20,"Person 1","i agree with that thats a great idea","p024","p050",1.3333,0,1.6667,2
4318,400,174,21,"Person 2","Yea...it will really help a lot","p024","p050",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.6667
4319,400,174,22,"Person 1","well it was a good talk man. bye.","p024","p050",1,0.3333,0.6667,1
4320,400,174,23,"Person 2","be","p024","p050",1,1,0.3333,1
4321,400,174,24,"Person 1","bye","p024","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4322,400,174,25,"Person 2","bye","p024","p050",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4323,400,175,0,"Person 1","I think it is so heartbreakin that that baby rhino died :(","p007","p005",4,2,4,2.3333
4324,400,175,1,"Person 2","yes i feel so sad about it","p007","p005",3.3333,2,4,2.3333
4325,400,175,2,"Person 1","Like I used to work in animal rescue so like, any animal suffering or dying hits me hard.","p007","p005",3.6667,2,3.6667,3.3333
4326,400,175,3,"Person 2","why do you think that happened?","p007","p005",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
4327,400,175,4,"Person 1","I'm not sure the article doesn't really say. I'd assume some complications when it was born or maybe it was sickly.","p007","p005",2,1,2.3333,1.3333
4328,400,175,5,"Person 2","I'm guessing so too","p007","p005",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
4329,400,175,6,"Person 1","I wonder why it was an orphan though. Maybe it's aprents were poached for ivory?","p007","p005",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
4330,400,175,7,"Person 2","i guess so too, that is sad","p007","p005",2.6667,2,2.6667,1.3333
4331,400,175,8,"Person 1","I think it's kinda messed up that they believe that ivory had medicinal properties over there. They kill so many animals just for their horns and stuff there.","p007","p005",3,2,3,2
4332,400,175,9,"Person 2","what do you think can be done to prevent this","p007","p005",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
4333,400,175,10,"Person 1","Well I know the local rangers and law enforcement at the animal reserves have beefed up their patrol efforts. I think they even patrol at night now. But other than like mroe patrols i dont think there is much they can do. Poachers build their own guns to hunt with, so it is hard to keep them unarmed.","p007","p005",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4334,400,175,11,"Person 2","wow, i really can not think of any solution now","p007","p005",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
4335,400,175,12,"Person 1","Thos epoaches guns are so sketch though, I remember reading something where one was killed because the gun exploded when he went to take down an elephant. He got trampled.","p007","p005",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
4336,400,175,13,"Person 2","wow, really","p007","p005",2.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
4337,400,175,14,"Person 1","Yea they legit make them out of low grade pipes and any scrap they can find. A lot fo them arent even capable of firing modern cartridges and are used like flintlock rifles.","p007","p005",1.6667,1,2,2
4338,400,175,15,"Person 2","how do you these animals can be helped at least?","p007","p005",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
4339,400,175,16,"Person 1","Well, I'd say the game reserves/ orphanages need more funding. But toher than that I think they are doing all they can. I think it mostly comes down to controlling the poaching. Which is a hard task to do.","p007","p005",2,1,3,2
4340,400,175,17,"Person 2","I totally agree with you","p007","p005",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4341,400,175,18,"Person 1","Yea I just hate that those animals are getting killed just for one body part. It's a waste.","p007","p005",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
4342,400,175,19,"Person 2","it saddens me honestly","p007","p005",3,2,3,2.3333
4343,400,175,20,"Person 1","Same. Anyway great talking to you fellow turker. Have a great rest of the workday :) bye!","p007","p005",2,1,1,1
4344,400,175,21,"Person 2","bye","p007","p005",1,0.6667,1,1
4345,283,176,0,"Person 1","I think its crazy how females need consent to travel abroad in that country","p024","p029",3,2,4,1.6667
4346,283,176,1,"Person 2","Me too!  As an American woman, I just find that mind-blowing and somewhat ridiculous.  I realize that their culture is very different from ours, though.  But sheesh.","p024","p029",3,2,3.3333,2
4347,283,176,2,"Person 1","Wow youre a female so you understand this more. As a man even I know its just not right!","p024","p029",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
4348,283,176,3,"Person 2","Yeah it seems absurd.  I'm glad they are taking some steps to at least give females there some more privileges to do some reasonable things without a male escort.","p024","p029",2.3333,2,3.6667,1.6667
4349,283,176,4,"Person 1","It makes me wonder what else females cant do in that country jeez","p024","p029",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
4350,283,176,5,"Person 2","Yeah I know right?  Like what CAN they do?  Is Saudi Arabia where they have to hide their faces or is that somewhere else?  I'm just grateful I live in the USA.","p024","p029",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
4351,283,176,6,"Person 1","Well it seems any country is better for females than Saudi Arabia.","p024","p029",2,1,3.3333,1.3333
4352,283,176,7,"Person 2","yeah no doubt.  I mean I honestly support traditional gender roles and all that, but they seem to take it to a major extreme there.  I think they need to loosen up the reins a little bit.","p024","p029",3,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
4353,283,176,8,"Person 1","It seems that international pressure is the only thing that can fix this","p024","p029",1.3333,1,2.6667,1.6667
4354,283,176,9,"Person 2","What do you think would work, economic sanctions?  Military power?  I am thinking that is where they see woman as objects and property, correct?","p024","p029",1,1,3,1.3333
4355,283,176,10,"Person 1","I believe sanctions would work wonders","p024","p029",1.6667,0.3333,3,1.6667
4356,283,176,11,"Person 2","They seem to have been effective in other areas.  I would think that we do a lot of economic trading with Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, who knows, there could be some dangerous ramifications for us for challenging their deeply held cultural beliefs.","p024","p029",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
4357,283,176,12,"Person 1","It is a slippery slope I agree. That is part of their culture at the end of the day for women to be treated that way","p024","p029",2,1,3,1.6667
4358,283,176,13,"Person 2","Yes and a long held tradition.  I'm sure this has been debated and discussed at length among groups such as the UN, etc.  I would think anyhow.","p024","p029",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
4359,283,176,14,"Person 1","yeah youre right. I guess they have every right to be that way although its odd","p024","p029",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
4360,283,176,15,"Person 2","Yeah it is.  It was also interesting in the article that some women were opposing the changes.  I guess that just goes to show it is such a part of their culture they see it as normal and do not want it to change.  SEems weird to me but to each their own.","p024","p029",2,1,3,1.6667
4361,283,176,16,"Person 1","or maybe theyre forced to go against the changes","p024","p029",1.6667,1,3,1.3333
4362,283,176,17,"Person 2","Yeah that is true.  You never really know with that country.  They might just be saying what they think they are supposed to say to avoid negative repercussions.","p024","p029",1.6667,1,3.3333,1.3333
4363,283,176,18,"Person 1","yeah this isnt their first rodeo lol","p024","p029",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333
4364,283,176,19,"Person 2","Right? lol.  I'm sure they have learned to say and do what will keep them out of trouble.","p024","p029",1.6667,1,3.6667,1
4365,283,176,20,"Person 1","didn't they kill some guy in an embassy a few months back as well or something like that. they just are not the most trustworthy people","p024","p029",1.3333,2,2.6667,1.3333
4366,283,176,21,"Person 2","I have not heard about that but I am sure you are probably right.  It seems like senseless violence is just a part of the culture there.  Not that it isn't here either, but it seems more out of hand there.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you about this.  I hope you have a nice afternoon.  Goodbye","p024","p029",2,1.3333,3,1.6667
4367,283,176,22,"Person 1","you too . bye.","p024","p029",1,0.6667,1,1
4368,283,177,0,"Person 1","I think it'll be interesting to see how this type of movement will progress.  It's easier than ever with social media to create social change.","p062","p002",1.6667,0,3,2.3333
4369,283,177,1,"Person 2","It would help if some outside nations would comment on the situation.","p062","p002",1,0.6667,2.6667,2
4370,283,177,2,"Person 1","It might.  But Saudis are proud.  If you go telling the King and his people that what they're doing is morally wrong, I think they're just as likely to spite you as to listen.","p062","p002",1.6667,2,3,2.3333
4371,283,177,3,"Person 2","Do you not feel the men of this nation are already doing a similar thing? It would help if all women in this nation felt this way.","p062","p002",1.3333,2,3,1.6667
4372,283,177,4,"Person 1","I'm not sure what you mean about the men.  Could you explain further?","p062","p002",0.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
4373,283,177,5,"Person 2","It does not seem like the men of this country are receptive to women speaking out against this system. Is this a logical response or are they too proud to realize how wrong this system is.","p062","p002",1,2,2.6667,1.6667
4374,283,177,6,"Person 1","I think \"wrongness\" is something that's not as simple as it might seem.  It's easy for us to criticize it from the outside, but we also weren't raised in that culture and see it very differently.  Also, the male-female dynamics inside relationships and homes are very different than the societal restraints put on women.","p062","p002",1.6667,1,3,2.3333
4375,283,177,7,"Person 2","It's not just us criticizing it but what sounds like a lot of women in that country as well. Social restraints are not the same thing as having to listen to your husband as if he was your parent.","p062","p002",2,1.3333,3,2.6667
4376,283,177,8,"Person 1","What about the Saudi women who want the system to stay the same?  Do you think they're brainwashed, or suffering from Stockholm Syndrome?  Or do you think their perspective is valid too?  Just curious.","p062","p002",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
4377,283,177,9,"Person 2","I think their perspective is valid but definitely a  mixture of brainwashing or could just be it's scary to have to take a stand against the old system. It's probably easier for a lot of women to not buck the norm and face hellish consequences.","p062","p002",2,1.3333,3.3333,2
4378,283,177,10,"Person 1","I think you exaggerate the consequences, but I understand your point.  My brother actually lives in Saudi Arabia and, as I said before, the male-female relational dynamics at a personal level are quite different from the systemic restraints.","p062","p002",1.3333,1,2.3333,3.3333
4379,283,177,11,"Person 2","Hard to say exactly what the consequences would be but I'd bet that some women would have it worse than others. I wonder how this situation impacts women without a husband. Are they allowed these freedoms or are they forced to marry?","p062","p002",1.6667,1,3.6667,2.3333
4380,283,177,12,"Person 1","I don't believe they're legally forced to marry, but since employment is limited, it's sort of a necessity.","p062","p002",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
4381,283,177,13,"Person 2","But this unmarried woman would still not be allowed to drive, leave the country, make her own doctor's appointments and such?","p062","p002",1.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
4382,283,177,14,"Person 1","I believe women are actually now allowed to drive.  I could be wrong about that but I think that was a recent change.  However, no, she'd have to get a male relative to sign off on her leaving the country.  Not sure about things like doctor's appointments. That might actually be the opposite, where it might be considered inappropriate for a man to be involved in that.  But not sure.","p062","p002",1.3333,1,2.6667,2.6667
4383,283,177,15,"Person 2","Ahh I remember the article stating that women needed permission when undergoing hospital treatment. It's hard for me to see the benefits of this limited freedom, social norm or not.","p062","p002",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
4384,283,177,16,"Person 1","I think the social media and internet influence in this is interesting.  i can imagine the women at home, spending a lot of time on their phones, seeing lives they want to be leading and that, in part, motivating them to seek change.  On some level it's no different than people in the West seeing a pair of sneakers they want, or a vacation one their friends took, and being desirous of that, too.","p062","p002",1.6667,1,3,2.3333
4385,283,177,17,"Person 2","Yea I can imagine that's part of it. No person should have to sit and dream about basic freedoms that 99% of other adult women have the option to make. And then being forced to remain in the country as well.","p062","p002",2,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
4386,283,177,18,"Person 1","Do you think the number is really as high as 99%  I think patriarchal cultures are still more prevalent than that.","p062","p002",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4387,283,177,19,"Person 2","Probably closer to 90% but I do not know of many other countries that restrict the right of women. Maybe this is more common in middle eastern countries","p062","p002",1.3333,0.3333,3.3333,2.3333
4388,283,177,20,"Person 1","Yes, I'm not sure.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Thanks for taking the time.  Have a good day.  bye","p062","p002",1.3333,0.3333,1,1
4389,283,177,21,"Person 2","you as well! bye","p062","p002",1,0,1,1
4390,283,178,0,"Person 1","Do you think the campaign to end the guardianship system in Saudi Arabia will be successful?","p041","p007",1,1,1,1
4391,283,178,1,"Person 2","I hope it will. I think it is really messed up how women are treated over ther ein that culture. No one should be treated as property. Plus theya re their own person; why do they need the permission of a man do so like literally anything?","p041","p007",4,2,3,1
4392,283,178,2,"Person 1","I don't think we should criticize their culture after viewing it through a lens of our own. I also don't believe women are treated more in a cherubic sensed as property. I would say they are regarding more","p041","p007",4,2,2,1
4393,283,178,3,"Person 2","You make a valid point that is pretty unfair of me to apply my values onto them in that way.","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4394,283,178,4,"Person 1","What do you think about the women who support guardianship? What is your impression of them?","p041","p007",2,1,1,1
4395,283,178,5,"Person 2","I'm not sure. Like i guess they are used to the set ways over there, or they just aren't bothered by it. I mean at the end of the day it is their choice to go along with it or oppose it, and since they are okay with it I guess it would be wrong of me to judge them for that since they are the primary party effected by the rule.","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4396,283,178,6,"Person 1","I agree that is their choice. I sincerely hope some compromise can be reached because it does appear that there are some women who are dissatisfied. I worry about how this movement will affect relations between Saudis and westerners","p041","p007",3,2,2,1
4397,283,178,7,"Person 2","Yea. Like my first impression was bad for sure because I immediately looked at things from like, our culture's point of view. I didn't think about it from their perspective. Which makes me kinda look like an ***hole. I hope things work out ok though for both parties of women over there though. Pollitical reform is always a hard road to travel. I hope that some positive progress is made.","p041","p007",3,2,3,1
4398,283,178,8,"Person 1","Do you know much about Saudi Arabia's history?","p041","p007",1,1,1,1
4399,283,178,9,"Person 2","Personally no, all I know is that there is a lot of conflict in that area and there has been for a while. Please enlighten me if you can; I am always open to learning new things","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4400,283,178,10,"Person 1","Well the short version is this: the first king of Saudi Arabia united the peninsula by warring with some tribes and allying with others. Classic Game of Thrones stuff. However in order to win his campaign he decided to ally himself with the Wahhabis. They were known for being particular good soldiers, but there was one catch: they are extremely orthodox and they made him promise that the new kingdom would follow their religious ideology. The new king began trading oil with the west and opened Saudi Arabia to westerners culturally and economically. The Wahhabis did not like this and they have been expressing their frustration about it in many ways for years, sometimes violently.","p041","p007",3,2,3,1
4401,283,178,11,"Person 2","Oh wow. I did not know any of that. That explains why their ways over there seem like they are set in stone; because the pretty much kinda are.","p041","p007",2,1,1,1
4402,283,178,12,"Person 1","Yes, the king made a promise he could not keep and the rest is history. Western culture has been slowly becoming more popular through trade, media, and now the internet. The traditionalist have been getting angrier and angrier about it over the years and I am concerned that this new movement will enflame these tensions. If that happens I don't think the west will be insulated from it.","p041","p007",3,2,2,1
4403,283,178,13,"Person 2","You know that kinda reminds me about all the church groups here that really hare lgbt and leftist pollitical ideals here in the south. So in that regard the traditionalists there and here aren't that different.","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4404,283,178,14,"Person 1","Yeah they might read different books but they are pretty much the same, but the traditionalist in Saudi Arabia have a lot more money and sometimes fund extremism.","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4405,283,178,15,"Person 2","I don't think extremism is ever good but that's just me. I hate violence. I don't think it is right to hurt people over beliefs. I'm sure there are groups here though that also fund violence. How does the KKK get all of it's funding? Someone's gotta be donating to them right?","p041","p007",2,2,2,2
4406,283,178,16,"Person 1","Maybe you are right. I hope that the Saudis can find some compromise, but if our culture is causing tensions between them maybe we should just back off. I would like whatever outcome allows us both to coexist peacefully. What do you think?","p041","p007",2,0,2,3
4407,283,178,17,"Person 2","Of course. Coexistance is what we need. We don't need to try to constantly police everything over there for sure.","p041","p007",2,0,2,2
4408,283,178,18,"Person 1","Yea I agree. Do you think guardianship will ever change or be abolished?","p041","p007",1,1,1,1
4409,283,178,19,"Person 2","I mean anything is possible. It just might take some time. Hopefully no violence comes out of it though.","p041","p007",2,0,2,1
4410,283,178,20,"Person 1","It seems like the opposition to it has been peaceful so far. Let's see how long that lasts. I found it interesting that the article mentioned there were women who support guardianship. I was hoping to hear more about them and why the support it","p041","p007",2,0,3,3
4411,283,178,21,"Person 2","Yea it would be interesting to hear more from their side about it. It's always nice to gain an understanding of both sides.","p041","p007",2,0,2,2
4412,283,178,22,"Person 1","Why do you think some Saudi women might be in favor of guardianship?","p041","p007",1,1,1,1
4413,283,178,23,"Person 2","Maybe they don't want to \"rock the boat.\" Or maybe they are just used to the system the way it is and don't mind it. I wish we could ask them.","p041","p007",2,0,1,2
4414,283,178,24,"Person 1","Good points. I was also curious what some of the Saudi men had to say about the issue but the article did not mention it","p041","p007",2,1,1,2
4415,283,178,25,"Person 2","Yea it would be intersting to know now many men are willing to end the system.","p041","p007",1,0,1,2
4416,283,178,26,"Person 1","What do you think they might say about it?","p041","p007",1,1,1,1
4417,283,178,27,"Person 2","I'm not sure. On the one half, you have the men who want to keep everything the same, and on the other there may be some who think that the women deserve a little more freedom on what they do. I'm sure there's plenty of arguing on both sides. Just like there is here about lgbt issues.","p041","p007",2,0,2,2
4418,283,178,28,"Person 1","Yes I am sure there is much debate. The article mentioned they were also discussing changing some aspects of guardianship. What changes do you think could be made that would ameliorate the concerns of some Saudi women?","p041","p007",2,1,2,1
4419,283,178,29,"Person 2","Hmm. Not entirely sure. Maybe they could reduce the senarios where they would need permission from a man to do things? Like working or studying.","p041","p007",2,0,2,2
4420,283,178,30,"Person 1","That might be a good place to start. This has been a great conversation. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye","p041","p007",0,0,1,1
4421,283,178,31,"Person 2","Likewise! have a great rest of the workday random turker! bye!","p041","p007",0,1,3,1
4422,283,179,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article","p022","p073",0.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
4423,283,179,1,"Person 2","I can't even imagine having to live like that as a woman. I support the women who are trying to get rid of the program.","p022","p073",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
4424,283,179,2,"Person 1","It's terrible. Imagine having to ask your partner for permission to do anything","p022","p073",4,2,3.3333,2.3333
4425,283,179,3,"Person 2","I seriously think I would be jailed or murdered if I lived there. I couldn't do it. And sometimes they have to ask their own son for permission.","p022","p073",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
4426,283,179,4,"Person 1","That is crazy! You would have to kill me before i ask my son for permission to do something!","p022","p073",4,2,3.6667,2.6667
4427,283,179,5,"Person 2","I know, and I wonder what age the son is old enough to make the decisions. I bet it's pretty yound.","p022","p073",3,2,3,2
4428,283,179,6,"Person 1","Probably. Imagine asking a 10 year old for permission to do something. Doesn't seem real..","p022","p073",3.3333,2,3,2
4429,283,179,7,"Person 2","It's unreal. I hope that these women are able to change something, but probably even if the system is ended, they will still be treated the same way by their families.","p022","p073",2.6667,2,4,1.6667
4430,283,179,8,"Person 1","Yeah, it's going to take MANY years of remolding their brains and seeing things from different perspectives until there is actual change","p022","p073",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
4431,283,179,9,"Person 2","I agree, it will probably take a very long time, but I guess change has to start somewhere.","p022","p073",2,1.3333,3,2
4432,283,179,10,"Person 1","That's true. We should be very fortunate because we have freedom to do what we want.. kinda","p022","p073",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
4433,283,179,11,"Person 2","Reading this article, I feel as a woman that I am very fortunate.","p022","p073",2.6667,0,3,2.3333
4434,283,179,12,"Person 1","That's great to hear. Would you ever date a partner that is controlling?","p022","p073",2,0.6667,2.6667,1
4435,283,179,13,"Person 2","I like to think that I wouldn't, but I think sometimes controlling people don't really show themselves at first. What about you?","p022","p073",1.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2
4436,283,179,14,"Person 1","That's an interesting take. I don't think i would ever be able to!","p022","p073",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
4437,283,179,15,"Person 2","That's good. I'm sure if I found myself with a controlling partner, it would not last long!","p022","p073",3,0.6667,3,2.3333
4438,283,179,16,"Person 1","I hope the women in Saudi Arabia are able to find freedom within the next 10 years, i feel they have bene suffering for a long time","p022","p073",2.6667,1,4,2.3333
4439,283,179,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I hope so too! It's been nice chatting with you!","p022","p073",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
4440,283,179,18,"Person 1","Nice chatting with you! bye","p022","p073",1.3333,0,1,1.3333
4441,283,179,19,"Person 2","bye","p022","p073",0.6667,0.6667,1,1
4442,283,180,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p019","p016",0.6667,0.5,1.3333,1
4443,283,180,1,"Person 2","I think it's about time and I'm very glad the movement has so much traction!","p019","p016",3,0,3.6667,2.3333
4444,283,180,2,"Person 1","Me too! I hope it continues to grow","p019","p016",2.6667,0,3.3333,2.3333
4445,283,180,3,"Person 2","Indeed. I know women just got the right to drive in Saudi Arabia a short while ago, so things are looking up at least.","p019","p016",2.3333,0,3.6667,2.6667
4446,283,180,4,"Person 1","Oh really? i didn't even know they couldn't... how crazy is that that it just barely happened...","p019","p016",2.6667,1.5,3,2
4447,283,180,5,"Person 2","Yep. Only men could get licenses before that (one of the many ways to keep women from being independent).","p019","p016",2.3333,0.5,3,1.6667
4448,283,180,6,"Person 1","That's so sad... But I am really glad they finally got the right!","p019","p016",3,0,2.6667,2.3333
4449,283,180,7,"Person 2","Agreed! It's baffling to me that there's an opposition protest to the movement. Just... Yikes™.","p019","p016",3,0.5,3.3333,2.3333
4450,283,180,8,"Person 1","Yikes for sure... I hope that as the older generations \"age out\" we will see some of that opposition fade away","p019","p016",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
4451,283,180,9,"Person 2","Yeah, that's unfortunately how things often go. Like, even in the US, it took until 1990 for opinion polls to get over 50% of people approving of biracial marriages. Prejudice takes so long to die off :/","p019","p016",2.6667,2,3,2
4452,283,180,10,"Person 1","Yes it's crazy how not long ago that kind of racism exsisted.","p019","p016",2.3333,1.5,3.3333,2
4453,283,180,11,"Person 2","Yeah. We like to pretend all that's in the past, but it's way closer than we think.","p019","p016",2.3333,1.5,2.3333,2
4454,283,180,12,"Person 1","For sure... Like I saw on FB the other day that the first african american child that was allowed into an all white school just turned like 68 or something... how crazy is that","p019","p016",2.6667,1.5,2.6667,2.6667
4455,283,180,13,"Person 2","Whoa, that's nuts. Yikes for sure.","p019","p016",2.6667,0.5,2,1.6667
4456,283,180,14,"Person 1","But it's good knowing that things are changing","p019","p016",2.3333,0,2.3333,2
4457,283,180,15,"Person 2","Yeah. I hope the situation in Saudi Arabia continues to change, hopefully without violence.","p019","p016",2.3333,0.5,3,2.3333
4458,283,180,16,"Person 1","Me too... Hopefully no war or civil war is started over any of it","p019","p016",2.3333,0.5,2.3333,2
4459,283,180,17,"Person 2","Honestly, I feel like we (the US) are too invested in their oil production to let that level of disruption happen.","p019","p016",2,0.5,2.6667,2.3333
4460,283,180,18,"Person 1","you are probably right","p019","p016",1,0.5,1,1.3333
4461,283,180,19,"Person 2","Yeah. For good or ill. *shrug*","p019","p016",2,0.5,1,1.3333
4462,283,180,20,"Person 1","haha... It's good that this stuff is becoming more prevelant in the media.. keep the folks aware of real things","p019","p016",2,0,1.6667,2
4463,283,180,21,"Person 2","Agreed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article?","p019","p016",1,0.5,0.6667,1
4464,283,180,22,"Person 1","no I didn't.. it's been nice talking!. bye","p019","p016",1.3333,0.5,0.6667,1
4465,283,180,23,"Person 2","bye!","p019","p016",0.6667,0.5,0.6667,1
4466,305,181,0,"Person 1","So I found this to be very tragic.  What kind of sick person creates a suicide website to attract little children?","p029","p055",4.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
4467,305,181,1,"Person 2","I can't even imagine how someone like that or multiple someone's like that can even exist. I am angered and saddened that these troubled kids are targeted in such a way.","p029","p055",4,2,3.3333,2.3333
4468,305,181,2,"Person 1","Yeah me too, like they are already at a disadvantage with families where they lack support and have rampant alcoholism and abuse.  They don't need predators preying on them like this.","p029","p055",3.6667,2,3,2
4469,305,181,3,"Person 2","Exactly. Who enjoys seeing such misery inflicted on others? I can't even begin to imagine how someone like that can do something like this. It's clear that Russia has a problem and then to see someone doing something like encouraging more deaths. It's sickening.","p029","p055",4.3333,2,3.6667,2
4470,305,181,4,"Person 1","It really is!  I have heard of some of these suicide sites before and I find it appalling and sickening.  People should be trying to help the situation not fuelling the fire.  What on earth.","p029","p055",4,2,3.6667,2
4471,305,181,5,"Person 2","I know. I just can't understand the mindset of people that find this enjoyable or acceptable. You'd like to believe that these troubled kids could go online to find the help they need that they can't or aren't getting at home. Intead, they are used as a sick game to disgusting people. Unreal.","p029","p055",4.3333,2,3.6667,2
4472,305,181,6,"Person 1","It really is unreal.  And it said that some of the owners of the sites they had found were not much older than the children they were targeting.  What would even compel someone to do something like this?","p029","p055",4.3333,2,2.6667,2
4473,305,181,7,"Person 2","I really don't know. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how someone must think to do this. It's like bullying. They said it fed their egos? Who enjoys knowing they hurt other people?","p029","p055",3.6667,2,3,2
4474,305,181,8,"Person 1","Yeah what on earth?  Like it makes them feel powerful or something?  I have no idea but it sounds like the mindset of a serial killer to me.  Which in a way, those people kinda are serial killers.","p029","p055",3.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
4475,305,181,9,"Person 2","Yeah, it'd say they are. It's crazy that someone would relish doing this kind of thing. How does someone even think that this is something appealing to them? How does it even get started. I just don't know why or what you can do to stop something like this.","p029","p055",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
4476,305,181,10,"Person 1","Yeah I have no idea, I am as mindblown as you are.  They should really have a special punishment for people like that who prey on these types of young victims.  I guess with every site you shut down another new one can just pop right back up.  That's the scary thing about the internet.","p029","p055",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
4477,305,181,11,"Person 2","It is. I don't want to start down a censorship slope, but you can see why the idea has merit. If you can't stop people from using the internet to harm others, what choice do you have? I'd like to believe parents or schools or someone could step in to help these troubled kids and lead them away from the internet that is causing them more harm than good.","p029","p055",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4478,305,181,12,"Person 1","Yes, ultimately it should be the parents who are censoring and policing things like that at home but obviously in these cases the parents are failing to do that job.  So who can step in to help?","p029","p055",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4479,305,181,13,"Person 2","I wish I knew. That is why this is continuing I suppose. And the fact that people don't like to talk about suicide, as if it's a dirty secret. Hopefully, more talk can lead to more people being aware online and doing more to keep shutting sites down.","p029","p055",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
4480,305,181,14,"Person 1","Yeah, like if they got things like this more out in the open.","p029","p055",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1
4481,305,181,15,"Person 2","Have more warnings about the dangers. Try to find what it is that lures kids to these sights and try and use those same tactics to lead them to locations of help rather than these nasty suicide cults or whatever they are.","p029","p055",2,1.6667,3,1.6667
4482,305,181,16,"Person 1","Yes and maybe have very harsh punishments for the offenders they catch.","p029","p055",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
4483,305,181,17,"Person 2","Yes, do more than shut the sites down. Track the people that are putting them up and doing more to punish their behavior.","p029","p055",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
4484,305,181,18,"Person 1","Yes! Like charge them with homicide.  It has been nice discussing this tragic topic with you.  goodbye","p029","p055",2,2,2,1.6667
4485,305,181,19,"Person 2","It's been a pleasure talking with you too. goodbye","p029","p055",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
4486,305,182,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about these, basically, Russian suicide communities?","p030","p062",1,1,2,1
4487,305,182,1,"Person 2","I guess I think it's sad that kids feel so sad and alienated (or whatever) that they are drawn to them.  But I also think it's pitiful that people lose themselves in internet groups like this.  It's artificial.","p030","p062",3.3333,2,3,2
4488,305,182,2,"Person 1","Artificial? How do you mean?","p030","p062",0.6667,0.6667,1,1
4489,305,182,3,"Person 2","I just think that the emotions we experience online are very different--much more intense--than what we experience in reality.  Ironically.  If we'd turn off our phones and the TV and went outside, we'd discover that there's a big difference between the virtual worlds on our screens, and the real world.  And the time we spend in the virtual ones doesn't seem to be good for our mental health, especially when we're already vulnerable.","p030","p062",3,1.3333,2.6667,3
4490,305,182,4,"Person 1","It's true, a disturbing amount of humans put more effort into cultivating and maintaining a paltry digital simulacrum of themselves than they do their actual body/mind/relationships. I think in a lot of ways, for children growing up in our world, the digital world is much more real than the one that physically surrounds them everyday.","p030","p062",3,1.3333,3.3333,3
4491,305,182,5,"Person 2","I agree, and I think that's sad.  It's ironic that in mental health, mindfulness is the current push.  And I think that the way we engage with the internet is the antithesis of being mindful.  So you have this strange dichotomy where more people need, or think they need, mental health help, which will push them towards things like mindfulness, while those same people do the exact opposite thing while engaging in their virtual worlds.","p030","p062",2.6667,1.3333,3.6667,3
4492,305,182,6,"Person 1","Mindfulness, in essence, is non-committal engagement of ones thoughts and feelings; acknowledging them as they are and letting them pass over you. The internet, on the other hand, is potentially a coliseum of unhinged emotional responses to both real world and subjective events and opinions. I think you're absolutely correct. People in our society are very quick to diagnose themselves, but rarely exert the effort to actually plumb the depths of their personal experience with a person who is qualified to make those diagnoses.","p030","p062",2.6667,1.3333,3,3
4493,305,182,7,"Person 2","I'd suggest that in this story, the parents are most capable of providing help, in all ways, but apparently the parents are a large part of the problem, what with the drinking and abuse and whatnot.","p030","p062",2,1,2.6667,2
4494,305,182,8,"Person 1","I think they are the most capable and most incapable in the same turn depending on the circumstances. I think more actual community involvement is key in these types of situations. Less time online and more time interacting with human beings toward a common goal.","p030","p062",2,1,3,2.3333
4495,305,182,9,"Person 2","The statistics intrigued me.  First, the inordinately high depression and suicide rates for Russia.  But also the 5% number (teenage depression, I believe it was) for the rest of the West.  That number seems low to me, though I don't really know.","p030","p062",2,1,3,2.3333
4496,305,182,10,"Person 1","If factor in western countries with higher quality of life (Noway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands) whose suicide rates are less then 1% i'm sure it skews the data.","p030","p062",1.3333,1,2,2
4497,305,182,11,"Person 2","I'd also suggest that the FOCUS on the internet communities themselves is maybe misguided.  Seems like a whack-a-mole problem in terms of shutting them down.","p030","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
4498,305,182,12,"Person 1","It's much easier to make a half hearted effort to apply blame and deal with superficial corollaries of social problems than address them at the root.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
4499,305,182,13,"Person 2","Absolutely.  A culture of victimhood.  But it does nothing to help the actual kids.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
4500,305,182,14,"Person 1","No, meaningful action against this problem would require time, money, empathy and a sense of duty to ones fellow man that is very scarce in the world today. It's the equivalent of cutting hair and just expecting it not to grow back.","p030","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
4501,305,182,15,"Person 2","I also wonder what the right balance is for issues pertaining to mental illness and health.  At what point does \"help\" and \"sympathy\" becoming enabling and rationalizing?  When does trying to eliminate stigma becoming encouraging people to self-diagnose and use mental health as a crutch, or excuse.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
4502,305,182,16,"Person 1","Well, help and sympathy are two mutually exclusive concepts. A lot of the time people who are experiencing intense isolation just need someone to talk to. I think that people who are actually diagnosed rely too heavily on prescription medication (which are only supposed to be a temporary crutch) and prefer to ignore the human element in therapy which is often the most beneficial.","p030","p062",2.3333,1,3.3333,3
4503,305,182,17,"Person 2","I'd agree with that.  In all parts of medicine, prescribing a pill has become the easy, satisfying thing to do. I'm flabbergasted when I see reports quoting the number of people taking things like Ambien.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.6667
4504,305,182,18,"Person 1","Ambien, antibiotics, anti-depressants. It's a depressing and short sighted landscape to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting. I think you were probably the most insightful person so far. bye","p030","p062",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
4505,305,182,19,"Person 2","Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye","p030","p062",1.6667,0.3333,0.3333,1
4506,305,183,0,"Person 1","Tell me what you think about the article?","p005","p041",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
4507,305,183,1,"Person 2","I was alarmed by some of the high suicide rates in Russian adolescents. I had no idea it was  so high and prevalent.","p005","p041",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
4508,305,183,2,"Person 1","I feel so sad about it","p005","p041",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
4509,305,183,3,"Person 2","Were you aware that adolescent suicide rates are also on the rise here in the US?","p005","p041",1,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
4510,305,183,4,"Person 1","Yes i was surprised when i found out","p005","p041",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
4511,305,183,5,"Person 2","I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia can be directly linked to social media groups. The rise of adolescent suicide here in the US directly parallels the growth and popularity of social media","p005","p041",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
4512,305,183,6,"Person 1","I will agree with that","p005","p041",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
4513,305,183,7,"Person 2","Why do you think Russian teens are embracing this online suicide culture?","p005","p041",0.6667,1,3,1.3333
4514,305,183,8,"Person 1","Maybe it is more about mental health?","p005","p041",1.3333,0.6667,3.3333,1.3333
4515,305,183,9,"Person 2","It could be that. Do you think socioeconomic factors play a role?","p005","p041",0.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.3333
4516,305,183,10,"Person 1","Yes, i think so too","p005","p041",1,0.6667,3,1.6667
4517,305,183,11,"Person 2","Which specific factors were you thinking of?","p005","p041",0.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
4518,305,183,12,"Person 1","I'm actually more concerned about the mental health status. I think it is the major factor","p005","p041",1.3333,1,3,2
4519,305,183,13,"Person 2","I think that can play a role, but Russia has the 3rd highest rate of adolescent suicide, 20%. Furthermore 45% of Russian teenage girls reported thoughts of suicide and 27% of teenage boys did the same. I think there is much more going on","p005","p041",2,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
4520,305,183,14,"Person 1","wow, those are large numbers","p005","p041",2,1.3333,3,1.3333
4521,305,183,15,"Person 2","Yea disturbingly large. I think social media paints a portrait of a lifestyle that is beyond the reach of many young Russians. Coupled with poor economic prospects many of them fall into despair, apathy, and hopeless thoughts.","p005","p041",2,1.3333,3.6667,1.6667
4522,305,183,16,"Person 1","what do you think can be done to prevent this?","p005","p041",1.3333,0.6667,2,1
4523,305,183,17,"Person 2","I think one solution would be to require social media websites to offer online counseling services to their users, particularly to those who are at risk","p005","p041",1.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2
4524,305,183,18,"Person 1","I totally agree with that. goodbye","p005","p041",1,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
4525,305,183,19,"Person 2","What suggestions do you have?","p005","p041",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
4526,305,183,20,"Person 1","Well, i think more awareness should be done so people with mental health can get help","p005","p041",1,1,3.3333,2
4527,305,183,21,"Person 2","I agree, but the trouble is that mental illness is not always easy to spot and sometimes these people are difficult to treat because of that","p005","p041",2,1,3.3333,1.3333
4528,305,183,22,"Person 1","More awareness means urging people with it to get help which i believe some will willing want to get help as well.","p005","p041",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4529,305,183,23,"Person 2","Maybe you're right. I also think we should discourage young people from idolizing vapid ''public figures'' and ''influencers'' they encounter on social media. Most of those people do not add value to society","p005","p041",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2
4530,305,183,24,"Person 1","That is absolutely correct","p005","p041",1.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
4531,305,183,25,"Person 2","I am wondering why we are not having a similar debate about these issues here in the US","p005","p041",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
4532,305,183,26,"Person 1","I think it is about priorities.","p005","p041",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4533,305,183,27,"Person 2","What makes you say that?","p005","p041",0.6667,1,1.3333,1
4534,305,183,28,"Person 1","Maybe there are more important this people focused on","p005","p041",1,0.6667,2.3333,1.3333
4535,305,183,29,"Person 2","Don't you think that teen suicide is important enough to focus on?","p005","p041",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
4536,305,183,30,"Person 1","Yes i do, but sadly so many people do not.","p005","p041",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
4537,305,183,31,"Person 2","That breaks my heart. It has been interesting chatting with you today. bye","p005","p041",2.3333,1.3333,1,1.6667
4538,305,183,32,"Person 1","Thank you, bye","p005","p041",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
4539,305,184,0,"Person 1","What do you think about the growing suicide rates among Russian teens?","p041","p009",0.6667,1.3333,2,1
4540,305,184,1,"Person 2","I think it is horrible !","p041","p009",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
4541,305,184,2,"Person 1","Would it surprise you to discover that a similar trend is occurring among US teens? The figures are not nearly as high, but there has also been a substantial increase suicides among US teens.","p041","p009",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4542,305,184,3,"Person 2","That does not surprise me, I have seen it in my own life","p041","p009",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,3
4543,305,184,4,"Person 1","Do you know anyone who has committed suicide?","p041","p009",0.6667,1,1.6667,1
4544,305,184,5,"Person 2","yes unfortunately I do","p041","p009",3,2,2,2.6667
4545,305,184,6,"Person 1","I am sorry to hear that. I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia were directly linked to social media","p041","p009",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
4546,305,184,7,"Person 2","I agree, social media can be extremely harmful","p041","p009",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
4547,305,184,8,"Person 1","The growth in suicides among US teens has paralleled the growing popularity of social media sites, but the two have never been directly linked like the Russian cases. I think awareness should be raised.","p041","p009",2,1,3,2.6667
4548,305,184,9,"Person 2","Yes I agree. anything that can be done to keep the kids safe","p041","p009",2,1,2.6667,2
4549,305,184,10,"Person 1","What are some ways you think this situation can be ameliorated, both here in the US and in countries like Russia?","p041","p009",1,0.6667,1,1
4550,305,184,11,"Person 2","I'm not sure entirely but I hope something can be done","p041","p009",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2
4551,305,184,12,"Person 1","I think social media companies should be required to offer counseling services to their users, particularly those who are at risk.","p041","p009",1.3333,0.6667,3,2.6667
4552,305,184,13,"Person 2","That would be a good start!","p041","p009",2,0,1.6667,2
4553,305,184,14,"Person 1","I agree. We should also give children real role models so they do not wind up emulating the vapid ''public figures'' or ''influencers'' they encounter on social media.","p041","p009",2,1,2.6667,2.6667
4554,305,184,15,"Person 2","I definitely agree with that","p041","p009",1.6667,0,2,2
4555,305,184,16,"Person 1","What do you think were some of the causes of the increased suicide rates among Russian teens?","p041","p009",0.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
4556,305,184,17,"Person 2","Perhaps an increase in anti social behaviors","p041","p009",1,1.3333,2,2
4557,305,184,18,"Person 1","Do you think there could be more complex socioeconomic factors?","p041","p009",0.6667,0.6667,3,1.3333
4558,305,184,19,"Person 2","im sure it is a mixture of many different factors","p041","p009",1,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4559,305,184,20,"Person 1","You are probably right. It has been very interesting discussing the article with you. Enjoy your day, goodbye","p041","p009",1.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
4560,305,184,21,"Person 2","thank you! goodbye","p041","p009",1,0.3333,0.6667,1
4561,305,185,0,"Person 1","The things you can find on the internet these days.","p030","p073",1,1.3333,2,1
4562,305,185,1,"Person 2","Yeah, this is so scary and sad.","p030","p073",3,2,3.3333,2
4563,305,185,2,"Person 1","How do you think tragedies like this can be averted?","p030","p073",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
4564,305,185,3,"Person 2","If they could keep these types of websites shut down. This girl probably wouldn't have done it if she hadn't been exposed to so much online. A 12 year old really isn't thinking it through.","p030","p073",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4565,305,185,4,"Person 1","I think an emotional child will always be able to find a place to exacerbate those feelings online no matter how many websites you shut down.","p030","p073",2,1.6667,3,2.6667
4566,305,185,5,"Person 2","Yeah, but I can also see kids that aren't even depressed, getting immersed in the online community and deciding it would be cool or somehow make them famous.","p030","p073",2,1.6667,3,2.6667
4567,305,185,6,"Person 1","I suppose anything is possible. Do you think it could have been prevented had her parents known about her online activity?","p030","p073",2,1,2,2
4568,305,185,7,"Person 2","I think her parents would have at least had a chance to try to do something. It sounds like they had no idea. What do you think?","p030","p073",2,1.3333,3,2.3333
4569,305,185,8,"Person 1","I think it's important to at least keep a passive eye on your kids online activity. There's so much toxic stuff out there.","p030","p073",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
4570,305,185,9,"Person 2","Yeah, I agree. Any story like this is so sad. I can't believe that children this young are ever committing suicide. It's just so sad.","p030","p073",4,2,3,2.6667
4571,305,185,10,"Person 1","Truly heartbreaking. All that wasted potential. They seem to be getting younger and younger too. I've seen stories of nine and ten year olds taking their own lives.","p030","p073",4,2,3.6667,2
4572,305,185,11,"Person 2","When my kids were that young I would have never thought that they might be considering such a thing. I feel so bad for any parent that has to deal with it. I can't imagine living after.","p030","p073",4.3333,2,3.6667,3
4573,305,185,12,"Person 1","I really can't even imagine. What do you think drives the people who are hosting the sites and grooming children like this?","p030","p073",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
4574,305,185,13,"Person 2","That's what I was wondering too. Why would you want to convince people to commit suicide? Maybe they are sociopathic and just get a kick out of it, which is utterly disgusting.","p030","p073",4.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
4575,305,185,14,"Person 1","right? it's not like they get anything else from it besides some satisfaction in having a hand in some child's death.","p030","p073",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
4576,305,185,15,"Person 2","It's really gross.","p030","p073",4,2,2,2
4577,305,185,16,"Person 1","I can only hope that the Russian government has been successful in cracking down on sites like this.","p030","p073",2.3333,1,2.6667,2
4578,305,185,17,"Person 2","Yeah, me too! It's been good chatting with you! bye","p030","p073",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1

4580,299,186,0,"Person 1","Hi there, so I found this to be sad.  It's always so tragic reading about plastic in the ocean and how it's harming wildlife there.  What did you think?","p029","p024",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
4581,299,186,1,"Person 2","I think we need to do better with our recycling.","p029","p024",1.3333,0.5,2.3333,2
4582,299,186,2,"Person 1","Yes but I don't think that's realistically going to happen.  It's like a problem with no solution.","p029","p024",2,1,2,2
4583,299,186,3,"Person 2","Lazy people are the problem","p029","p024",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
4584,299,186,4,"Person 1","sometimes recycling is very difficult for people.  it's not always as easy as it sounds","p029","p024",2,1.5,2.3333,1.6667
4585,299,186,5,"Person 2","well most cities make it easier I guess it depends where you're at. My city makes it easy","p029","p024",1.6667,0.5,2.3333,2
4586,299,186,6,"Person 1","I live in a very rural area where you have to drive your own garbage to a landfill that is ten minutes or more away and is only open a few hours several days a week","p029","p024",1.3333,1,2,2.6667
4587,299,186,7,"Person 2","Yeah what I do is just collect all my beer and soda cans instead of throwing them out and every 6 months or so take them to the local recycling place and they usually pay me around 400  bucks for all the cans. Its a rare case where drinking pays off.","p029","p024",1.6667,0.5,1.6667,2.6667
4588,299,186,8,"Person 1","yeah I thought about doing that too.  Part of the problem is our house is already unbelievably cramped and there is literally nowhere to store extra garbage.  we already can barely fit the one garbage can we have.  I have four kids. anyway, not trying to make excuses just saying some cities definitely make it easier","p029","p024",2,0.5,2,3
4589,299,186,9,"Person 2","yeah cant really talk about rural areas since I've never lived there","p029","p024",1,0.5,1,2.3333
4590,299,186,10,"Person 1","yeah when I lived in a city there was no excuse not to recycle unless you were just lazy.  you just set the container out on the curb.  it's very different here.","p029","p024",1.6667,0.5,2.3333,2.3333
4591,299,186,11,"Person 2","I assume there must be some recycling centers though?","p029","p024",0.6667,0.5,1.6667,1.3333
4592,299,186,12,"Person 1","the recycling center IS the landfill, same place you take your trash to","p029","p024",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
4593,299,186,13,"Person 2","thats just terrible","p029","p024",2.6667,1.5,1.6667,1.3333
4594,299,186,14,"Person 1","yeah and since it's only open a few days we already have several bags stacked up waiting to go on those days.  we bought cans to put them in outside but you can't have but so much garbage just sitting around outside your house or it starts to attract wildlife.  anyway.  just a difficult situation as far as recycling.","p029","p024",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.6667
4595,299,186,15,"Person 2","yeah man and its nobodys fault at that point. IT would be nice to have those places out in rural areas as well.","p029","p024",2,0.5,2.3333,1.6667
4596,299,186,16,"Person 1","yeah I wish they made it easier.  The trash situation in general out here sucks.  some people pay a service to come pick up their trash but we can't afford that.  so there ya go.  but it is sad about those birds in the ocean.  I bought re-usable water bottles for us so we try to minimize our trash","p029","p024",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
4597,299,186,17,"Person 2","I've been using a hydro flask I bought on Amazon for a year now and man its one of the best investments. Keeps my water cold the whole day and no need for water bottles.","p029","p024",2.3333,0.5,2.3333,2
4598,299,186,18,"Person 1","hydroflask?  I will check that one out.  Well it has been good talking to you about this issue.  I hope you have a great rest of your afternoon.  goodbyes","p029","p024",1.6667,0.5,0.6667,1
4599,299,186,19,"Person 2","do check it out. bye.","p029","p024",0.6667,0.5,0.6667,1
4600,299,187,0,"Person 1","I thought the science behind why the birds eat plastic was interesting.","p062","p063",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
4601,299,187,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I would have never guessed that the plastic gives off the same \"scent\" as food.  Weird.","p062","p063",2,0.6667,2,2.3333
4602,299,187,2,"Person 1","I also thought is was telling that all the worst countries in the world at dumping plastic in the ocean are Asian.  They're really bad about that stuff, obviously.","p062","p063",2,2,2.6667,2.3333
4603,299,187,3,"Person 2","I think that statistic was misleading though.  From what I understand, they're the largest polluters, because we (the west) ship them all our trash.","p062","p063",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4604,299,187,4,"Person 1","Could be.  I think they're attitudes about trash and pollution are different from ours though.","p062","p063",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
4605,299,187,5,"Person 2","I'm sure.  I think they also can't afford to have the same opinions as us.  In fact, I just remembered how one of those countries, perhaps Indonesia, just shipped back several thousands of tons of trash back to Europe, as they said they were shipped against their wishes.","p062","p063",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
4606,299,187,6,"Person 1","I wonder if there will be, or can be, any change to the composition of the plastics so they don't give off this sulphurous odor.","p062","p063",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4607,299,187,7,"Person 2","I would rather see them change the root cause.  Less pollution.  I think we as americans have been turning a blind eye to these issues too long, and that needs to change.","p062","p063",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4608,299,187,8,"Person 1","Sure.  I think people are lazy, though, so there will always be a ton of waste since there will always be a ton of consumption.","p062","p063",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
4609,299,187,9,"Person 2","Right.  So maybe we need to get away from one time consumables, and move to products that are biodegradable.  I know that this issue of paper straws, and no plastic bags is mocked quite often, but it's a movement that needs to happen.","p062","p063",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
4610,299,187,10,"Person 1","\"Needs\" in what sense?","p062","p063",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
4611,299,187,11,"Person 2","Are you asking what defines my use of the word, \"needs\"?","p062","p063",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
4612,299,187,12,"Person 1","I guess I'm looking for specific ramifications from us doing otherwise.  Needs is a strong word.  What exactly will happen if we don't ban plastic straws that makes that action imperative.","p062","p063",2,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
4613,299,187,13,"Person 2","Well that is a question that would need to be answered at a different time, as there is waaay too much for this venue, but for starters, banning plastic straws should just be the start.  The plastics and oil industry is probably the most toxic thing to happen to this planet.  Plastics are in everything.  That not only creates pollution in the oceans, kills wildlife and changes ecosystems, but it is the primary contributor to global warming.  Too many people selectively listen to their bought and paid for politicians and lobbyists, and don't buy the conecpt of climate change, but oh well, I'll get off my soapbox","p062","p063",3,1.3333,2,3
4614,299,187,14,"Person 1","That's fine, I don't mind listening to people's concerns.  I have my own.  From a practical perspective, do you think there's a WILL to make these changes, even if there's a WAY?","p062","p063",2,0.6667,1,2.3333
4615,299,187,15,"Person 2","Not really.  I think too many people think the change needs to happen from up top, instead of themselves making the change.  I think most people don't understand that we vote/enact change with out wallets, and too many americans are too greedy to have any foresight, and concern themselves with any issue that don't take place in their immediate bubble.","p062","p063",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
4616,299,187,16,"Person 1","Yes, I agree with that.  I think convenience is also an extremely big part of it.  I also think few people are willing to take steps \"backwards\" in terms of quality of life, even if they do care about issues like these.  And I think there's another problem, which is that humans have a very hard time appreciating dangers that they've never experienced.  Our brains just aren't very good at imagining repercussions, or taking them seriously, when we haven't experienced those things yet.","p062","p063",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,3
4617,299,187,17,"Person 2","Agreed.  I also think our brains have a difficult time comprehending things that don't occur in our experienced time frames.  Hearing time scales of thousands or millions or billions of years is something most people can't wrap their brains around, so when scientists bring up changes that are occuring, normal people shrug it off as something that will be overcome, or has already happened before.","p062","p063",2.3333,1,2.6667,3.3333
4618,299,187,18,"Person 1","Yes, as you say, back to our own immediate bubble.  At some point real weather events that directly impact people might prompt some change.  Maybe, I'd be interested to know if people who get wiped out by a hurricane or flooding change their attitudes about environmental stuff, or do even those people not change.  I think that'd be interesting data.","p062","p063",2.3333,0.6667,2,3.3333
4619,299,187,19,"Person 2","I live in a hurricane area, and I don't think weather events will change anything.  It'll just be the same narrative.  \"This has always happened\", \"I've seen this before.\"  Because even our current crisis of climate change will take place over 50 to 100 years, the effects will not be immediately obviously visible, and people will continue to shrug it off until it's too late.","p062","p063",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
4620,299,187,20,"Person 1","Yes, I think that's a good point.  It's easy to go back to believing everything is normal.  And it might be too late anyway.  Well, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye","p062","p063",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4621,299,187,21,"Person 2","bye","p062","p063",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
4622,299,188,0,"Person 1","I was so surprised to learn of yet another way our plastic is harming the environment. What did you think of this study on plastic causing harm to sea birds?","p055","p041",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
4623,299,188,1,"Person 2","I was alarmed to learn that they are eating the plastic, but I can not say I was surprised that it is having such a damaging effect on their ecosystem","p055","p041",2.6667,1.3333,3,2.3333
4624,299,188,2,"Person 1","No, I knew plastic was an issue. I just didn't realize that it was this particular issue. Amazing to think that plastic is emitting a scent that is causing birds to eat it. Crazy, amazing and weird how nature works.","p055","p041",2.3333,1,3.3333,2
4625,299,188,3,"Person 2","If I remember correctly is was algae coating the plastic that emit the DMS. In any case we have to increase conservation efforts because we are poisoning this planet","p055","p041",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
4626,299,188,4,"Person 1","Oh for sure. As if we needed another reason to clean up the ocean, but this is definitely another example of why the clean up is so important and why we need to get away from using so much plastic.","p055","p041",2,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
4627,299,188,5,"Person 2","I have seen so many novel ideas to accomplish this, but there does not seem to be any real political will to implement them sadly","p055","p041",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
4628,299,188,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I'm amazed at some of the ideas that have been suggested and even put into use. The problem is there is so much ocean and trash already out there and so few people working to clean it up.","p055","p041",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2
4629,299,188,7,"Person 2","I understand it may be a daunting task, but wouldn't it be more manageable if retrieval efforts are concentrated around the shoreline? We know the waste begins its journey on land","p055","p041",1.6667,1,3,2.6667
4630,299,188,8,"Person 1","I don't know what method would be best. I figure any method that starts the process is a good one. I do know there are large masses of plastic that have been forming out in the ocean and it seems to me finding ways to gather those large groups would be a good start.","p055","p041",1.3333,0.3333,3.3333,2
4631,299,188,9,"Person 2","I read about a small town that did something pretty simple but effective and it reduced their run off waste by about 90%","p055","p041",1,0.3333,2.3333,2
4632,299,188,10,"Person 1","Oh yeah? I figure any step is a step in the right direction. I'm pleased to see anyone making any changes that will hopefully continue to grow and make a difference. I'm tired of us doing so much damage to the environment and the animals of this planet. They deserve the right to life as well.","p055","p041",2.3333,0.6667,3.6667,3
4633,299,188,11,"Person 2","Yes we don't have the right to adversely effect other species. You wouldn't believe me how simple this solution was","p055","p041",2.3333,1,3.3333,2
4634,299,188,12,"Person 1","I agree we need to do more. So what was the simple solution?","p055","p041",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
4635,299,188,13,"Person 2","They just put a large fine mesh net on the outlet of their storm drain so the plastic didn't runoff into the local river. The pictures I saw showed it full of plastic they collected and prevented from reaching the ocean! Amazing, simple, and effective!","p055","p041",2.3333,0,2.3333,2
4636,299,188,14,"Person 1","Yes, a great idea and a good way to begin to try and keep more plastic out of our water systems. If everyone did one simple thing perhaps we could be saving our sea life and making the environment better. Proud to see steps taken to make such a difference.","p055","p041",2.3333,0,3.6667,2
4637,299,188,15,"Person 2","What do you think are some ways we can help reduce plastic waste in the ocean?","p055","p041",0.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4638,299,188,16,"Person 1","I believe we need to stop using so many plastic products. Recycle more and make sure that it is being recycled and not just dumped somewhere later. It will take a lifestyle change to do more to make sure that we reduce the need for plastaic.","p055","p041",1.6667,0.6667,3.3333,2
4639,299,188,17,"Person 2","I agree that it will take serious life style changes, but I only see the demand for plastic products increasing in the future","p055","p041",1.6667,1,2,2
4640,299,188,18,"Person 1","I don't know. I think there is a movement slow though it may be to reduce plastic use. I hope that it continues. I've enjoyed our chat today. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. goodybe","p055","p041",2,0,1.3333,2.3333

4644,299,189,1,"Person 2","I agree, who knew that is how seabirds hunt.","p065","p035",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
4645,299,189,2,"Person 1","Yeah, I thought that smell would have somehting to do with it, but it's crazy that they are now attracted to plastic waste in the oceans.","p065","p035",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
4646,299,189,3,"Person 2","Do you think we \"human\" are going to change before it is too late?","p065","p035",1,1.3333,2,2
4647,299,189,4,"Person 1","Well, yes and no. It will be too late for a lot of species, but we'll save ourselves.","p065","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
4648,299,189,5,"Person 2","I agree, polar bears and panda are done along with a lot of other species.","p065","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
4649,299,189,6,"Person 1","Yeah. And protections for endangered species are being stripped away. Now, I'm not a hardcore environmentalist, I mean, I recycle and all that, but it's pretty hard to ignore the damage being done.","p065","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
4650,299,189,7,"Person 2","Do you think people who do not believe in climate protection, really believe we are doing nothing wrong or just being blindly selfish?","p065","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
4651,299,189,8,"Person 1","Well, some are very religious and believe that the earth was made to be used up by humans leading up to judgement day.","p065","p035",1,1,1.6667,1.6667
4652,299,189,9,"Person 2","Countries like China are not going to stop polluting anytime soon.","p065","p035",1,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
4653,299,189,10,"Person 1","True. Some developing and even first world countries see it as their right to grow industry, as we have over the last two centuries, and that they should be able to do what they deemed necessary to grow, just as we have.","p065","p035",1,1,2,1.6667
4654,299,189,11,"Person 2","I can see their viewpoint, but they should also learn from our mistakes.","p065","p035",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
4655,299,189,12,"Person 1","Sure, but we have a priviledged position to dictate taht. We can enjoy the advantages of doing stuff the wrong (yet wildly profitable) way, so that we can enjoy that advatage and then set new, more stringent rules for everyone else. I'm not saying they are right in thinking that, but it's hard to argue...","p065","p035",2.3333,1,2,2.6667
4656,299,189,13,"Person 2","Like you said earlier, we are rolling back protections and backed out of the Paris accords.","p065","p035",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
4657,299,189,14,"Person 1","Yup. It's tough all around. Plus, if we could just end our love affair with red meat, then we could effectively halt global warming - but, I still want the freedom to have a steak when I want one, lol","p065","p035",2,1,1.6667,2.6667
4658,299,189,15,"Person 2","I agree, I'm not an impossible burger person. I would cut back if I knew he would truly help my children's future on this planet.","p065","p035",2.3333,1,2.6667,2.6667
4659,299,189,16,"Person 1","Yeah. I don't eat red meat as much as I used to, but I still do enjoy the taste of a burger and steak. You know, 100 years from now, the world will probably be on a veggie and insect diet, but I want to hold off on eating grasshopper burgers for the time being.","p065","p035",1.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
4660,299,189,17,"Person 2","I always envision the movie demolition man where they are eating rats. LOL","p065","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
4661,299,189,18,"Person 1","Yeah, lol. It's not that far off. It will probably be insects instead of rats, but, yeah, bascially what we consider vermin and pests will be our main food sources.","p065","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
4662,299,189,19,"Person 2","A lot countries in Asia already eat rats and insects.","p065","p035",1,1,1.6667,1.3333
4663,299,189,20,"Person 1","yeah. Someday, it will be a thing here, only it will be a hipster eco-trend, like composting and urban gardens.","p065","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
4664,299,189,21,"Person 2","I would like to see us move away from gas cars.","p065","p035",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
4665,299,189,22,"Person 1","Oh, that's gonna happen in a big way. Electric is gonna take over, at least in the cities. Self-driving cars will be the norm in cities too.","p065","p035",1.3333,0,1.3333,2
4666,299,189,23,"Person 2","I'm scared of self driving cars.","p065","p035",2.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
4667,299,189,24,"Person 1","Ha, I hear ya - the thought is unsettling, but no more unsettling than all those bad human drivers out there...","p065","p035",2.6667,0.3333,1,2.6667
4668,299,189,25,"Person 2","Yeah, but I have never seen a perfect technology. It was nice chatting with you! bye.","p065","p035",1.6667,0.3333,1,2
4669,299,189,26,"Person 1","Likewise! I think I have to say it first, then you. so, goodbye","p065","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1,1.3333

4672,299,190,2,"Person 1","What does \"t\" mean? I thought the article was sad what is happening to the birds.","p022","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
4673,299,190,3,"Person 2","so did I, am I sorry, I accidentally hit enter and it sent before I could type.  I was going to say that was very sad, what did you think?  I think the amount of plastic in our ocean is ridiculous","p022","p029",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
4674,299,190,4,"Person 1","Oh it's okay! It's very sad.  I think humans should take more responsibility","p022","p029",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
4675,299,190,5,"Person 2","seriously it would be like someone coming and just dumping trash in our houses","p022","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
4676,299,190,6,"Person 1","I've never thought of it like that but yeah , it sucks! I'm definitely guilty of harming the environment at times","p022","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
4677,299,190,7,"Person 2","me too, i use so many plastic water bottles","p022","p029",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4678,299,190,8,"Person 1","I hope the next generation understands climate change more and makes a difference!","p022","p029",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
4679,299,190,9,"Person 2","I think they will.  they make a big deal of it at my kids' school","p022","p029",1.6667,0.3333,2,2.6667
4680,299,190,10,"Person 1","That's interesting! I don't think i've ever even heard of the word climate change back when i was in school.","p022","p029",2.6667,1,2,2
4681,299,190,11,"Person 2","no me either.  I personally think climate change is just a natural occurrence and data shows it actually has benefits for our planet, but the trash problem is a separate issue.","p022","p029",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
4682,299,190,12,"Person 1","I'm not sure what can be done to fix that though unfortunately, people will continue to be...people","p022","p029",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
4683,299,190,13,"Person 2","yeah seriously, and convenience is a huge factor.  not to mention it would take such a major overhaul to eliminate all the plastic.  it's in practically everything","p022","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
4684,299,190,14,"Person 1","Yup, although some countries like China are heading towards the \"green\" direction. I believe they're trying their best to eliminate plastics","p022","p029",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
4685,299,190,15,"Person 2","yeah their trash problem is insane though, have you ever looked at pics?  it's disgusting","p022","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
4686,299,190,16,"Person 1","True, they really have no choice lol","p022","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
4687,299,190,17,"Person 2","lol no doubt, it's like filling the streets","p022","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
4688,299,190,18,"Person 1","Hopefully this problem will be fixed in the future! It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p029",1.6667,0,1,1.3333

4690,313,191,0,"Person 1","I find myself on the fence about this article. While I feel sympathy for those fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries, I also understand Germany not wanting to just open it's doors to everyone. Very much like situations we're facing here in the US at this time. What are your thoughts on the situation?","p055","p004",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
4691,313,191,1,"Person 2","I agree, it appears that the system is overburdened as well.","p055","p004",1.3333,1.3333,3,1.3333
4692,313,191,2,"Person 1","It does seem so. I find it interesting that Germany makes decisions based on where the people are coming from as well. We hear so often how the US is the only country being selective or not wanting too many refugees but everyone is facing similar situations.","p055","p004",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
4693,313,191,3,"Person 2","Well, I think their priority is war torn countries. The claims are easier to prove.","p055","p004",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
4694,313,191,4,"Person 1","Perhaps. I think the trouble is there are just too many for any country to take them all. Every story is troubling, but wouldn't it be better to focus on improving conditions in those countries rather than letting everyone leave and overburden other countries?","p055","p004",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4695,313,191,5,"Person 2","OH, I absolutely agree. But, in the case of a small country like Germany-what can they do? It seems we are no longer aligned with out European neighbors, so relying on the US is worthless.","p055","p004",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
4696,313,191,6,"Person 1","I believe Germany has to do what it can to protect itself first, otherwise how can it help anyone? I feel bad for some of the people talked about in the article, but I can understand why Germany has had to draw some hard lines.","p055","p004",2.3333,1,3,1.6667
4697,313,191,7,"Person 2","I feel for them as well. The USA has done very little for immigrants. If we could just help the Syrians, maybe the rest of Europe could help other countries.","p055","p004",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
4698,313,191,8,"Person 1","I don't agree that the US has done little for immigrants or anyone else. We can't be the world police. We have our own issues and our own borders are overwhelmed by those attempting to flee Central and South America. I think it is a world problem that the world needs to work on to do better. Helping the war torn countries as a whole. The burden shouldn't fall on any one country.","p055","p004",3,1.6667,2.3333,3.3333
4699,313,191,9,"Person 2","Well, not one country, but countries that have the resources should take on their proportionate share. Canada, for a small country handles immigration rather well.","p055","p004",2,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333
4700,313,191,10,"Person 1","I don't know much about how Canada handles immigration. I do think the problem isn't about immigration though but why the people are leaving their home countries. I feel that efforts need to be made to solve the problems in the countries people are fleeing to help a larger number of people and reduce the burden on other countries like in Germany that are often overwhelmed by those seeking a safer place to live.","p055","p004",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.6667
4701,313,191,11,"Person 2","I agree. It seems as if there is no clear solution, especially in case hard to prove. The poor Pakistani man probably faces real danger if he returned to his village, but what about another area of the country. Same with the Nigerian.","p055","p004",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
4702,313,191,12,"Person 1","I agree. The people highlighted in the story seem to have a true need to find safety somewhere else. Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed.","p055","p004",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
4703,313,191,13,"Person 2","They same could be said for the many Central Americans coming into the US. Although I take issue when the president claims they are rapist and gang members. Most immigrants just want a better life.","p055","p004",2.6667,1.3333,3,2
4704,313,191,14,"Person 1","I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem.","p055","p004",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
4705,313,191,15,"Person 2","True, but our system is underfunded and overwhelmed as well. I live in Florida and know a few illegals-they are good people and contribute to my community.","p055","p004",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4706,313,191,16,"Person 1","Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made.","p055","p004",2.6667,1.3333,3,2.3333
4707,313,191,17,"Person 2","In the case of the illegals I know, they were desperate to provide for their families and so- I guess you're right-they cut in line. But I'm not sure they had a choice. their families were starving.","p055","p004",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
4708,313,191,18,"Person 1","I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution. Thanks for sharing your thoughts today. goodbye","p055","p004",2.3333,1,2,2
4709,313,191,19,"Person 2","bye","p055","p004",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4710,313,192,0,"Person 1","I feel sorry for all the people who get turned back.","p035","p064",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
4711,313,192,1,"Person 2","I do too","p035","p064",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
4712,313,192,2,"Person 1","I think the solution is to help their home countries.","p035","p064",1.3333,0.6667,3,2.3333
4713,313,192,3,"Person 2","Yes that would be ideal, their local authorities should be invovled","p035","p064",1.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
4714,313,192,4,"Person 1","I think people don't realize how bad it has to be for a person to float across the sea on a small boat with 200 other people.","p035","p064",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.6667
4715,313,192,5,"Person 2","Yes, they are very unsympathetic in the fact that that person had to leave everything behind to try to get into Germany just to be turned away, I couldn't imagine being in a situation like that","p035","p064",2.6667,2,2.6667,3
4716,313,192,6,"Person 1","Yeah, it makes me grateful for the things that I have.","p035","p064",2.6667,0.3333,3.3333,3
4717,313,192,7,"Person 2","It makes me very grateful as well, I wish that people didn't have to live that way","p035","p064",3,1,2.6667,2.6667
4718,313,192,8,"Person 1","me either, some people take joy in seeing other people have less than them.","p035","p064",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
4719,313,192,9,"Person 2","Also, I am sure they probably accept some people that are trying to get into Germany for the wrong reasons, like the economy but don't accept people that are in trouble with the cartel","p035","p064",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
4720,313,192,10,"Person 1","I don't like that they play favors with certain countries. The world will be a better place when we see each other as one.","p035","p064",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,3
4721,313,192,11,"Person 2","Exactly, just people some people are from certain countries doesn't mean they are bad people","p035","p064",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
4722,313,192,12,"Person 1","Hopefully German and the USA will get this right in the future.","p035","p064",2.3333,0.6667,3.3333,2
4723,313,192,13,"Person 2","Yea this whole thing reminded me of the USA as well, Its disgusting how they treat these children","p035","p064",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
4724,313,192,14,"Person 1","I totally agree with you. It is inhumane.","p035","p064",4,2,3.3333,2.6667
4725,313,192,15,"Person 2","So inhumane and sad","p035","p064",3.3333,2,3.3333,3
4726,313,192,16,"Person 1","I think we are in the silent majority.","p035","p064",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
4727,313,192,17,"Person 2","Yes I think so too, its very strange to me when people support the unfair treatment of immigrants","p035","p064",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
4728,313,192,18,"Person 1","Sadly this country, the world, is built on unfair treatment.","p035","p064",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
4729,313,192,19,"Person 2","Yes it is, every aspect is","p035","p064",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2

4737,313,193,3,"Person 2","yeah its human nature to always try and cheat the system. i guess that's why there are difficulties now","p024","p044",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
4738,313,193,4,"Person 1","The problem needs to be fixed from the root and thats in those countries","p024","p044",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
4739,313,193,5,"Person 2","of course. all these cause of unnecessary wars are what drives people away","p024","p044",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333

4756,313,194,0,"Person 1","hello, what did you think of this?","p029","p019",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4757,313,194,1,"Person 2","I thought it was interesting... I never really hear about immigration outside the US border stuff","p029","p019",1,1,1,1.6667
4758,313,194,2,"Person 1","Yeah me neither, you're right.  I felt really bad for the men it described, I mean how scary, but on the same token Germany has a right to turn away whomever they want","p029","p019",2.3333,2,3,2
4759,313,194,3,"Person 2","It is scary for sure... but yes they have their rights, and I get it... I just wish there were better ways to deal with this kind of things ya knwow","p029","p019",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
4760,313,194,4,"Person 1","yeah for sure, I do too.  Like a nation refugees could go to that was made just for them.","p029","p019",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
4761,313,194,5,"Person 2","That would be interesting... or even just a more streamlined, human based process","p029","p019",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
4762,313,194,6,"Person 1","yes,that considered each individual sitution.  I can't imagine how many applications they have to process, though, and someone has to pay for all this","p029","p019",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
4763,313,194,7,"Person 2","For sure, it's got to be a crazy crazy workload....","p029","p019",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
4764,313,194,8,"Person 1","yeah no doubt.  It","p029","p019",1.3333,1,0.6667,1

4766,313,194,10,"Person 1","sorry, I hit enter too soon.  yes, so true!!  it just seems like such a sad situation without any real practical solution","p029","p019",2.6667,2,3,2
4767,313,194,11,"Person 2","It also sucks that there is such a negative connotation with it all because of the people who come over illegaly","p029","p019",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
4768,313,194,12,"Person 1","yeah it's definitely a situation where the bad actions of some ruin it for many","p029","p019",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
4769,313,194,13,"Person 2","And the people in charge just want to waste money and time on building walls and \"blocking\" them from coming in instead of making it possible for them to come in and be productive members of society","p029","p019",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
4770,313,194,14,"Person 1","sometimes walls are necessary, as there are many who want to come in and not be productive members of society.  again, the bad who ruin it for the good","p029","p019",2.3333,2,2,2
4771,313,194,15,"Person 2","agreed, it could be helpful, but it seems there are other actions we could be taking","p029","p019",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
4772,313,194,16,"Person 1","like what?","p029","p019",0.6667,1,1,1
4773,313,194,17,"Person 2","Like streamlining the process of imigration and making it more attainable. Streamline the process of becoming a citizen if you are already residing in the US. If their already living here, why not collect taxes from them?","p029","p019",2.3333,1,2,2
4774,313,194,18,"Person 1","yes, but the wall isn't made for people already living here.  anyway, I hear you and you seem to have a good heart.  I must go, have a good day! bye!","p029","p019",2,0.6667,1.6667,2

4777,313,195,1,"Person 2","it was interesting they need to send the refugees back","p024","p039",1.6667,1,1.3333,2

4798,398,196,0,"Person 1","Hey there.  I find it distressing anytime human technology is leading to the death of animals.  It seems so very frequent and common.  What did you think?","p029","p062",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
4799,398,196,1,"Person 2","Yes, we certainly have a habit of encroaching on animals' habitats and doing harm to them.","p029","p062",2,2,2.6667,1.6667
4800,398,196,2,"Person 1","Yes indeed we do.  It's really unfair to them but it's like an inevitable thing as society continues to grow.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
4801,398,196,3,"Person 2","Yes, there will always be compromises to be made.  Do we trade more greenhouse gasses for more dead birds, etc.  We're something of an invasive species and will continue to do what we do.  I think the question is just how, precisely, and what we choose to compromise.","p029","p062",2.3333,1,3,1.6667
4802,398,196,4,"Person 1","Yes I agree.  It seems particularly sad when it is an endangered species that is being compromised.  I did not see anything in the article about what they planned to do to fix the situation, did you?","p029","p062",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
4803,398,196,5,"Person 2","No, I didn't.  They were just talking about using this finding as further food-for-thought for wind farms.  I've also always wondered whether wind farms affect weather patterns.  You can't just take energy out of the air \"for free.\"  That affects something.  I wonder if, like this bird situation, we truly understand the ramifications of these wind farms, and whether it's the right alternative energy to be pursuing so aggressively.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
4804,398,196,6,"Person 1","Yeah I agree with what you are saying completely.  It seems like in trying to fix things, there are often unintended consequences that further harm other things.","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
4805,398,196,7,"Person 2","Yes, and we start down a path without being fully informed about what the ramifications are.  We did the same thing 100+ years ago with coal and oil!","p029","p062",3,1.6667,3,2.6667
4806,398,196,8,"Person 1","Yeah totally!  And so many other things.  You would think we would have learned our lesson by now but nope.","p029","p062",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
4807,398,196,9,"Person 2","Indeed.  I do wonder if there are specific things they can do to protect the birds, though.  Someone must be thinking of something.  Like, scents that deter them, or colors or something.  I don't know much about birds but you'd think there'd be some way to scare them or deter them from those locations.","p029","p062",2,1,3,2.6667
4808,398,196,10,"Person 1","Yeah that is a really good point.  You would think there would be something.  Surely scientists have vetted this out?","p029","p062",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
4809,398,196,11,"Person 2","I would think so, but maybe it isn't a high priority or something.  I'm guessing the companies with a vested interest in wind farms don't want the bird killing to be paid attention to.  And maybe animal rights groups don't have the resources or something.  Not sure but I personally never hear that much about wind farms, positive or negative.  Energy talk tends to center around oil and coal.","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
4810,398,196,12,"Person 1","Yeah I don't hear much about it either.  I don't really seek out that info though but I do read the news every day and I never see anything about it.  I have heard about the bird issue just over the years in different settings.  It seems to be an ongoing issue for sure.","p029","p062",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.6667
4811,398,196,13,"Person 2","I'd be interested to see how people felt if we just lay all the cards on the table.  Obviously we aren't this knowledgeable, but if we just said, \"These are the pros and cons of wind, solar, oil, nuclear, etc. what do the people prefer?\"  In other words, what do you sacrifice?  Dead birds, cost, nuclear fears, Carbon dioxide/global warming, etc.  I'd be interested to see how people chose because, again, you have to compromise somewhere.","p029","p062",2.6667,1,3.6667,2.6667
4812,398,196,14,"Person 1","Yeah totally.  It's easy for people to sit there and throw out idealistic notions but when it really came down to the practicality of it all and the pros and cons were laid out including cost, what would people choose","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4813,398,196,15,"Person 2","Right.  And I also feel like we, the people, don't get to have that much say.  This is a larger conversation than we have time for, but my energy costs have spiked dramatically in the last few years because the energy company is going towards wind, and it's expensive.  I'm not saying that isn't what I'd ultimately choose, but I don't even get a choice.  I have one utility company and have to accept their monopoly.","p029","p062",3,1.3333,2,3
4814,398,196,16,"Person 1","That is a good point as far as not getting any input.  Our costs have gone up too and we only have one company to choose from.","p029","p062",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
4815,398,196,17,"Person 2","The other thing I'd be interested about is what rodent populations are like around these wind farms.  If you kill all the birds of prey, how does that affect these lands for farming or grazing.  You wonder if land owners, who've agreed to have these wind turbines erected on their lands, will regret it.","p029","p062",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
4816,398,196,18,"Person 1","Oh yes true, ike the other populations will get out of control.  It could set the entire ecosystem out of balance.  Such is the danger when we tamper with nature.  Well I have enjoyed hearing your insights and hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2,3
4817,398,196,19,"Person 2","Yes, it was great chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p029","p062",1.3333,0,1,1.3333
4818,398,197,0,"Person 1","who knew that wind turbines are killing eagles.","p035","p064",1.6667,1.6667,3,1
4819,398,197,1,"Person 2","Yes, I had no idea that this was even an issue","p035","p064",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
4820,398,197,2,"Person 1","It is hard to think about because wind is clean power","p035","p064",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
4821,398,197,3,"Person 2","Exactly and it seems like, hopefully, we will head in to that direction to slow down global warming.. i guess you can never win no matter what you do","p035","p064",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
4822,398,197,4,"Person 1","Yeah, eagles and bats vs everything else.","p035","p064",1.3333,1.3333,2,1
4823,398,197,5,"Person 2","Because I believe coal fired energy kills birds as well","p035","p064",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
4824,398,197,6,"Person 1","I agree. I wonder what are the downsides to solar.","p035","p064",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
4825,398,197,7,"Person 2","I wonder if they could make something that stops them from coming near the windmills","p035","p064",1.3333,1,3,1.3333
4826,398,197,8,"Person 1","I don't know, but that is a good idea.","p035","p064",1,0,2,1.6667
4827,398,197,9,"Person 2","Yes, there needs to be a way to do something since coal fired energy is probably worse","p035","p064",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
4828,398,197,10,"Person 1","I read an article about the good side of nuclear power.","p035","p064",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
4829,398,197,11,"Person 2","Really? I didn't know there was a good side","p035","p064",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
4830,398,197,12,"Person 1","it is clean and safe if done right","p035","p064",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1
4831,398,197,13,"Person 2","That's very interesting","p035","p064",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
4832,398,197,14,"Person 1","what do you think is the best power?","p035","p064",1,1,1,1
4833,398,197,15,"Person 2","Couldn't solar panels produce the same amount of energy","p035","p064",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
4834,398,197,16,"Person 1","you need a lot of solar panels","p035","p064",1,1.3333,1.3333,1
4835,398,197,17,"Person 2","What do you think is the best kind of power? I read an article that wind turbines cause cancer","p035","p064",1.6667,2,2.3333,2
4836,398,197,18,"Person 1","I like natural gas, but it is limited.","p035","p064",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
4837,398,197,19,"Person 2","That is true","p035","p064",1,1,1,1
4838,398,197,20,"Person 1","have you ever seen a wild eagle?","p035","p064",1,1,1.3333,1
4839,398,197,21,"Person 2","Yes i have, they are beautiful. I saw one at a park in NJ. Have you?","p035","p064",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.3333
4840,398,197,22,"Person 1","Yes, its scary how big they are","p035","p064",2.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
4841,398,197,23,"Person 2","Yea haha. I have seen a few large birds pick up baby squirrels by my house to eat them. Freaked me out","p035","p064",3,1,2,3
4842,398,197,24,"Person 1","I would be freaked out too.","p035","p064",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
4843,398,197,25,"Person 2","Maybe they can make smaller wind turbines so they don't kill birds","p035","p064",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
4844,398,197,26,"Person 1","Yeah, or change the color or been them make a sound the birds don't like","p035","p064",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4845,398,197,27,"Person 2","They are attracted to the wind it creates because it helps them glide better... its like putting sugar out on your counter and not expecting to get ants","p035","p064",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
4846,398,197,28,"Person 1","Do you have any other points about the article?","p035","p064",1,1,0.6667,1
4847,398,197,29,"Person 2","No, do you?","p035","p064",1,1,0.6667,1
4848,398,197,30,"Person 1","No, nice chatting with you! bye","p035","p064",2,0.3333,0.6667,1
4849,398,197,31,"Person 2","bye","p035","p064",1,1,0.6667,1
4850,398,198,0,"Person 1","man, what an article. About the birds, right?","p027","p073",2.3333,1,2,1.3333
4851,398,198,1,"Person 2","yeah, really makes you wonder","p027","p073",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
4852,398,198,2,"Person 1","wonder what, friend?","p027","p073",1,1,1,1
4853,398,198,3,"Person 2","If what we are doing is really improving life on earth","p027","p073",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
4854,398,198,4,"Person 1","everything we do harms somehting. Like a bunch of Godzillas crushing everything, indiferrently. If you want to walk ten paes, you have to crush a dozen living things under your stupid feet","p027","p073",3,2,2,2
4855,398,198,5,"Person 2","Yeah, but are the wind energy generators something that should be used or not? And there are not that many yet. Have you ever seen areas where they are?","p027","p073",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
4856,398,198,6,"Person 1","i have seen these things. They don't seem to be filled with the corpses of dead birds, though.","p027","p073",1.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
4857,398,198,7,"Person 2","I'm thinking of the fields of giant windmills. I see them sometimes when I am driving in rural areas. They are massive and each area has many windmills. It seems that they go on for miles. I can't imagine being a bird and trying to navigate that.","p027","p073",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
4858,398,198,8,"Person 1","yes. its troublesome that everything we do, we kill some natural, simple thing. It's not u to me, though, but I guess just by having electricity or whatever I'm complicit.","p027","p073",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
4859,398,198,9,"Person 2","It just really makes you wonder, when we look back on technologies, will we have done the right thing or did we end up damaging the earth more in our efforts to help.","p027","p073",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4860,398,198,10,"Person 1","well, we're definetly not trying to help the earth, or if we are, its for our own benifit and no one elses, just so we can keep living","p027","p073",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
4861,398,198,11,"Person 2","Yeah, it's been a relatively short time that humans have been living on the earth in civilized societies. I can't imagine how long we can continue this without destroying everything.","p027","p073",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
4862,398,198,12,"Person 1","its troubling. what does life even mean if it can just be wasted, used up on wind turbines or pollution, or green energy, or land deveopment. Just being alive doesn't seem to be worth so much, if it ever was.","p027","p073",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
4863,398,198,13,"Person 2","A lot of people probably don't think that way. They just have to have all of the latest and greatest and don't really think about how future generations are going to suffer.","p027","p073",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
4864,398,198,14,"Person 1","but its us, too. you and me, right now, benifiting form all of it. If you could have the choice between a life of air conditioning, or a living bird, what would you do? We've all already made that choice.","p027","p073",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
4865,398,198,15,"Person 2","You are right. It would be impossible to live in this society without using these things.","p027","p073",2,1,1,1.6667
4866,398,198,16,"Person 1","bird would do it to us if they got the chance. If they could have shelter and protection a our expense, they wouldn't care. Life is just so cruel and selfish.","p027","p073",2.3333,2,1,2
4867,398,198,17,"Person 2","I guess that's true, but the bird doesn't have the knowledge that we do. Maybe they can just figure out a way to put giant cages around the windmills or something so that the birds can't fly into the fans.","p027","p073",2,1,2,2
4868,398,198,18,"Person 1","or a signal that makes birds avoid it, something only they can hear, but the point isn't about the birds","p027","p073",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
4869,398,198,19,"Person 2","Yeah, that would be a good idea.","p027","p073",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.3333
4870,398,198,20,"Person 1","its a grain of sand on a beach of utter inhumanity","p027","p073",3.3333,2,1,1.3333
4871,398,198,21,"Person 2","I'm just trying to look for a little positive. Maybe we can figure out a way to all live happily!","p027","p073",2.6667,0,1.6667,2
4872,398,198,22,"Person 1","we can't. i'm running out of tie. bye?","p027","p073",1,2,1,1.3333

4917,398,200,0,"Person 1","hey what did you thin about the article","p068","p024",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4918,398,200,1,"Person 2","I think thats a crazy death to have just flying around and running into a wind turbine","p068","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
4919,398,200,2,"Person 1","Same here, they are great sources of energy but I didnt know they were killing machines","p068","p024",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
4920,398,200,3,"Person 2","It makes sense since birds also run into windows from houses all the time that they would run into wind turbines","p068","p024",1.3333,1,2.6667,1
4921,398,200,4,"Person 1","Yeah that is true I wonder if they could do anything to prevent it","p068","p024",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
4922,398,200,5,"Person 2","do you think they can do anything to prevent it","p068","p024",0.6667,1,2.3333,1
4923,398,200,6,"Person 1","Mybe some kind of gate system around them","p068","p024",1,1,3,1
4924,398,200,7,"Person 2","yeah or like a chemical sprayed around the area that birds and flying animals are digusted by and fly around because of the smell","p068","p024",1,1,3,1.3333
4925,398,200,8,"Person 1","Oh thats a really good one! they should use the fine money to come up with solutions","p068","p024",2,0,2.3333,1.3333
4926,398,200,9,"Person 2","yeah i agree it has to be planned out right","p068","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
4927,398,200,10,"Person 1","And they should account for local and migrating birds","p068","p024",1,1,2.3333,1.3333
4928,398,200,11,"Person 2","Yeah after that the deaths should lower","p068","p024",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
4929,398,200,12,"Person 1","yeah more attention to it would help","p068","p024",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
4930,398,200,13,"Person 2","hopefully things do get better","p068","p024",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.3333
4931,398,200,14,"Person 1","I think they will as more research is done the technology is newer","p068","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2
4932,398,200,15,"Person 2","yeah as technology improves so does everything else and this will be no exception","p068","p024",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.3333
4933,398,200,16,"Person 1","True we never know the bumps in the road until investigations like this are done","p068","p024",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
4934,398,200,17,"Person 2","yeah it must be tested thorougly first","p068","p024",1,1,1.6667,1.3333
4935,398,200,18,"Person 1","its been a pleasure talking with you! bye","p068","p024",1.3333,0,0.6667,1
4936,398,200,19,"Person 2","bye","p068","p024",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4937,31,201,0,"Person 1","Hello. What did you think of the article?","p060","p028",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
4938,31,201,1,"Person 2","I found it to be incredibly frustrating and sad, i think it is a shame that more is not being done to protect that forest and more importantly the Orangutan that call it home.","p060","p028",3,2,2.6667,2.6667
4939,31,201,2,"Person 1","I agree. I can't believe that people get to make money off of destroying nature.","p060","p028",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
4940,31,201,3,"Person 2","Exactly, and whats even more questionable is the lack of action from the Indonesian government. Almost like people have just decided it is okay if certain species go extinct.","p060","p028",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
4941,31,201,4,"Person 1","While I was reading the article I started thinking that the Indonesian government must be getting some sort of financial incentive to ignore the destruction.","p060","p028",1.6667,1.6667,3,2
4942,31,201,5,"Person 2","More likely than not. Even though it shouldn't be necessary maybe if only there were tax incentives or something for these companies if they are helpful with the environment.","p060","p028",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
4943,31,201,6,"Person 1","That's a great idea. I don't know what will make companies stop destroying the earth. Nothing seems to be working.","p060","p028",2.6667,1,2.6667,2
4944,31,201,7,"Person 2","Yeah i don't think they will stop until we are actually at the brink, or stopping makes them more money of course.","p060","p028",3,2,2,2
4945,31,201,8,"Person 1","Have you ever seen an orangutan in real life? It is unreal how human like they seem. I kept thinking about that while reading the article, they must be so scared.","p060","p028",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
4946,31,201,9,"Person 2","Never had the chance myself but that is even more chilling, it is very easy to forget just how intelligent these animals really are. It doesn't make sense how people could look at the animals that are affected and not think maybe we shouldn't do this.","p060","p028",3.3333,2,2.3333,3
4947,31,201,10,"Person 1","I feel like sadly it is only going to get worse because right now a lot of the world is refusing to believe they are destroying the earth.","p060","p028",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
4948,31,201,11,"Person 2","I agree, i actually don't think it is possible for it to get better before it gets worse. People need to actually see the outcome of there actions before they can change.","p060","p028",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
4949,31,201,12,"Person 1","I know this is kind of morbid, but I feel like maybe all the scientists are right and we really only have a certain number of years left before we kill the earth. Feels like they are getting close to cutting all the trees down at least.","p060","p028",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
4950,31,201,13,"Person 2","They have to be getting close, and i believe it honestly. With how much pollution that has occured for the sake of greed i pray that we are able to change before the we finish the job on the earth.","p060","p028",3.3333,2,2,2.6667
4951,31,201,14,"Person 1","It would be nice to see some sort of group created that has the power to punish all countries that allow stuff like this to happen.","p060","p028",2.3333,0.3333,2,2
4952,31,201,15,"Person 2","I agree, almost like a united nations for environmental protection. Where the largest countries come together and ensure that change begins to occur. But that wont happen with so many people currently in power denying the issue.","p060","p028",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
4953,31,201,16,"Person 1","I know, here in America is feels like the government wants to destroy the environment. Maybe everyone in power is getting paid to keep quiet about he issues","p060","p028",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
4954,31,201,17,"Person 2","They are definetely making a ton of money on keeping quiet and ignoring the issue. My big hope is maybe all this greed and innovation leads to the renewable energies like wind and solar starting to pay off big for us and maybe we start to phase out oil.","p060","p028",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
4955,31,201,18,"Person 1","I hope so, it makes so much more sense. I think sometimes nothing is going to change because so many people are afraid of new technology","p060","p028",2,1,2,2.3333
4956,31,201,19,"Person 2","I agree, but it is either accept new technology and change or watch as the world just gets worse and worse in the coming years","p060","p028",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
4957,31,201,20,"Person 1","Lets hope that doesnt happen! It was nice to meet you, have a great day. goodbye","p060","p028",2,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
4958,31,201,21,"Person 2","Yeah lets hope, and nice to meet you also. goodbye.","p060","p028",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
4959,31,202,0,"Person 1","I feel bad for the orangutans!  But this palm oil issue seems to be a very big one in Indonesia.","p062","p029",3.3333,2,3,2
4960,31,202,1,"Person 2","Yeah I feel bad for them too.  I don't know much about the whole palm oil issue, I found it a little confusing.","p062","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
4961,31,202,2,"Person 1","Yes, the article sure was.  But apparently Indonesia cuts down forests to grow palm trees to make palm oil.  But the palm oil industry is apparently terrible for the environment in all sorts of ways.","p062","p029",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
4962,31,202,3,"Person 2","The whole deforestation thing sounds damaging to me in and of itself.  It seems we should b e protecting forests, not destroying them.","p062","p029",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
4963,31,202,4,"Person 1","Right, particularly when what they're doing apparently violates an international agreement they're apparently part of.  But it's about economics, so that usually wins out.","p062","p029",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
4964,31,202,5,"Person 2","Yes, that too.  It seems so damaging on many levels.  I guess their country is pretty impoverished though and this is one of their main economic resources?","p062","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
4965,31,202,6,"Person 1","Yes.  So you have the age-old question of what are the rights of mankind and what are the rights of nature?  But also, what is best for mankind's present versus the future?  There's always a compromise, and we usually choose us, and now.","p062","p029",2.3333,1,2,2.3333
4966,31,202,7,"Person 2","Yeah totally.  I mean I try to put myself in the shoes of people that live there and perhaps that is their only means.  I really don't know enough about Indonesia to say.","p062","p029",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
4967,31,202,8,"Person 1","Yeah, me too.   These are complicated issues.  There isn't some simple, perfect answer or we'd likely have found it.","p062","p029",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
4968,31,202,9,"Person 2","Yeah exactly.  I'd like to think they are doing the best they can and trying to ensure their people survive.  I don't know.","p062","p029",2.3333,1,2,2.3333
4969,31,202,10,"Person 1","But I do think it underscores one challenge we have in these global issues.  Different countries/cultures/economies see the world very differently.  In the west, in our relative prosperity, we focus on certain things.  And in these high-population, low-wealth countries, they focus on much more basic goals.  Sort of like a Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs thing.  The point is, getting everyone to go along with some worldwide issue like reducing greenhouse gases, is extremely difficult if not impossible.","p062","p029",3,1,2.6667,3
4970,31,202,11,"Person 2","Yeah I agree.  It's like we are on different pages.  So we need to be able to take their perspective before we judge I Guess.","p062","p029",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
4971,31,202,12,"Person 1","For sure.  I was also wondering about orangutan populations and how bad they actually are.  Not sure where else they live, or if there are healthier populations elsewhere.","p062","p029",2.3333,1,3,2.3333
4972,31,202,13,"Person 2","Yeah I really know practically nothing about them.  The estimate of how many were dying was really vague, like a very wide range.  I reckon it is hard for them to even know exactly the impact they are having.","p062","p029",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
4973,31,202,14,"Person 1","That's the other thing with all these issues.  I admit I'm ignorant, but I'm also not sure if I can even trust information and data we get, or for sources to really represent the whole picture.  Everything is so political and narrow.  And we're just bombarded with so many issues and opinions these days.  At some point you just throw up your hands and say, I'm not sure what to think.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.6667,1,3.3333
4974,31,202,15,"Person 2","Yeah totally, that is so very true.  And everyone has a bias or a political agenda they are trying to promote, and you can distort facts to sway things a certain way with almost anything.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
4975,31,202,16,"Person 1","That's the thing about the internet.  I think people feel they're MORE informed these days, but I'm not sure it's the opposite.  There's just too much information.  I don't think our brains are designed to handle so much.  We can make sense of what we can touch (figuratively) but trying to comprehend this incomprehensibly large planet?  I think it's too much.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
4976,31,202,17,"Person 2","Yeah exactly!  And we all have our biases and seek out information that confirms the things we believe and ignore other info.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
4977,31,202,18,"Person 1","Yes, I admit that I'm as guilty as anyone.  I cherry pick opinions and stories that corroborate my beliefs.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
4978,31,202,19,"Person 2","Yeah I totally do too.  And go to my favorite news sources which are biased towards my beliefs.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you enjoy your day.  bye","p062","p029",2,0.3333,1.3333,3
4979,31,202,20,"Person 1","Yes, nice taking with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p062","p029",2,0.3333,0.6667,1
4980,31,203,0,"Person 1","That just angers me.","p024","p035",4,2,3.6667,1.6667

4982,31,203,2,"Person 1","We need to do more to keep these endangered species afloat.","p024","p035",2.6667,1.3333,3.3333,1.6667
4983,31,203,3,"Person 2","I think they need to pay countries to not harvest their natural resources.","p024","p035",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
4984,31,203,4,"Person 1","They need to find other ways to go about doing things","p024","p035",2,1.3333,3,1.3333

4986,31,203,6,"Person 1","Orangutans are endangered in that province so  it tends to make people angrier than usual","p024","p035",3,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
4987,31,203,7,"Person 2","Yea, I would hate to lose orangutans","p024","p035",2,2,3.6667,1.6667
4988,31,203,8,"Person 1","the risk of fires would increase if sungai putry was drained and deforested so its odd they'd do all that.","p024","p035",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
4989,31,203,9,"Person 2","Corporations rule the environment","p024","p035",2,2,2,1.6667
4990,31,203,10,"Person 1","nah, money rules all. money is the root of all evil. someone with money can do that doesnt have to be a big corporation unfortunately money is the key thing here","p024","p035",2.6667,2,2,2
4991,31,203,11,"Person 2","What do you think we could do to help them stop?","p024","p035",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
4992,31,203,12,"Person 1","give sanctions to the country","p024","p035",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
4993,31,203,13,"Person 2","That could work","p024","p035",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
4994,31,203,14,"Person 1","what do you think should be done to stop them?","p024","p035",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
4995,31,203,15,"Person 2","I would pay them to make a large part of the forest a national park.","p024","p035",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
4996,31,203,16,"Person 1","thats actually a good idea as well","p024","p035",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
4997,31,203,17,"Person 2","I think that is what they do in Africa for large game parks","p024","p035",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
4998,31,203,18,"Person 1","yeah thats true","p024","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333

5006,31,203,26,"Person 1","not really do you?","p024","p035",1,1,0.6667,1
5007,31,203,27,"Person 2","No, it was really nice chatting with you. bye","p024","p035",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1
5008,31,203,28,"Person 1","bye","p024","p035",1,1,0.6667,1
5085,201,206,0,"Person 1","hello, how did you feel about the article?","p009","p029",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
5086,201,206,1,"Person 2","I was so disgusted.  Sorry if you disagree.  I just think going out and looting and acting uncivilized in response to something you disagree with is such a horrible way to respond.  There are many other more mature ways to react.  And as a result, another man is dead.  What did you think?","p009","p029",3.6667,2,3,3.3333
5087,201,206,2,"Person 1","I agree. it is sad for many reasons","p009","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
5088,201,206,3,"Person 2","Yes very much so.  But at the end of the day, the officer reacted in an effort to protect himself and the lives of other officers.  They have a very difficult job and are threatened constantly and have to make snap decisions sometimes.  This was not a racial thing.  The officer himself was African American.  So the reaction of the community was entirely inappropriate to me.  They LOOTED a Hornets store!!!  What on earth.","p009","p029",4.3333,2,3,3.3333
5089,201,206,4,"Person 1","I think the looting is awful because it affects innocent shop owners","p009","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.6667
5090,201,206,5,"Person 2","Yes, totally innocent people who had nothing to do with this.  Now their store is destroyed.  How on earth is this an appropriate response to being upset about a shooting","p009","p029",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
5091,201,206,6,"Person 1","it doesnt make any sense","p009","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
5092,201,206,7,"Person 2","No, it's totally illogical.","p009","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5093,201,206,8,"Person 1","unfortunate that more have to suffer","p009","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
5094,201,206,9,"Person 2","Yes, very sad and unfortunate.  If you disagree with things that happen int he community you should write your representatives or political leaders and express your feelings","p009","p029",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
5095,201,206,10,"Person 1","i dont mind protesting, just without damaging things","p009","p029",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
5096,201,206,11,"Person 2","I think protesting in general is absurd but it is people's first amendment right.","p009","p029",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5097,201,206,12,"Person 1","by protesting i dont mean looting and rioting","p009","p029",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
5098,201,206,13,"Person 2","yeah it just seems like it usually turns into that.  But a peaceful protest is people's right, I have no problem with that.  I just personally would never waste my time doing something like that.  That's just me.  I don't care if others do.","p009","p029",3,1.3333,2,2.6667
5099,201,206,14,"Person 1","i can agree with that","p009","p029",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
5100,201,206,15,"Person 2","Anyhow, I'm not really sure that there is a solution to these violent protests.  It seems like it's a fairly common occurrence and it's a huge threat to the communities involved.  When will it end","p009","p029",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
5101,201,206,16,"Person 1","im not sure but i hope it comes to an end soon","p009","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
5102,201,206,17,"Person 2","Yes so do I.  It seems like harsher punishments would be good but it's hard to arrest and control a humongous rioting crowd.","p009","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
5103,201,206,18,"Person 1","yeah true that can escalate the violence","p009","p029",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
5104,201,206,19,"Person 2","yes exactly, and make things worse","p009","p029",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5105,201,206,20,"Person 1","nice chatting with you, goodbye","p009","p029",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1
5106,201,206,21,"Person 2","goodbye","p009","p029",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
5107,201,207,0,"Person 1","This is certainly a contentious issue.","p062","p055",2,1,2,1.3333
5108,201,207,1,"Person 2","It is very much. I am afraid we're going to keep seeing it. However, I feel we are only getting half the story and we're only making national headlines about cops shooting people and not people shooting cops.","p062","p055",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
5109,201,207,2,"Person 1","Yes, I like to say that just because a story is true, doesn't make it representative of the country as a whole.  If the news decided to run stories about kidnappings, they could very easily have the country go into a panic over that.  We get just the slightest sliver of a glimpse of the country through the news, and it skews our perspective.","p062","p055",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
5110,201,207,3,"Person 2","I totally agree. We tend to see the media picking and choosing what they focus on. We don't even get a fair representation of happenings. Instead, we get a skewed view to press a political hot button and not giving a fair understanding of the incidents.","p062","p055",2.6667,2,2,3.3333
5111,201,207,4,"Person 1","Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do.","p062","p055",3,1.6667,2,2.6667
5112,201,207,5,"Person 2","I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas.","p062","p055",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,3.3333
5113,201,207,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens.","p062","p055",4,2,2.3333,3
5114,201,207,7,"Person 2","I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves.","p062","p055",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5115,201,207,8,"Person 1","Yeah, precisely.  I also ask myself in these issues, how much danger do we expect these cops to put themselves in?  How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do.","p062","p055",3.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
5116,201,207,9,"Person 2","I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media.","p062","p055",3.3333,1.6667,2,3.3333
5117,201,207,10,"Person 1","Yes, that's the question I want answered.  It's not, \"Why are people getting shot by police?\"  It's, \"Why is there a generation of people, and apparently predominantly blacks, who don't think they have to respect the law and law enforcement?\"","p062","p055",3,1.6667,1.6667,3
5118,201,207,11,"Person 2","I'm afraid it's what they are being taught by parents, social media and even music. They are told people are, \"out to get them\" and so they don't have to listen to anyone -- not just cops, but teachers and anyone in authority. It's a sad state of affairs I'm afraid.","p062","p055",2.3333,2,2,3
5119,201,207,12,"Person 1","Yes, I think that teachers and principals have largely abdicated their authority and influence.  Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children.","p062","p055",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5120,201,207,13,"Person 2","Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way.","p062","p055",3,1.6667,2,3
5121,201,207,14,"Person 1","Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion.","p062","p055",3,2,1.6667,2.6667
5122,201,207,15,"Person 2","It is. It's like everything in society now, though. We have gone to the extreme to avoid upsetting anyone or offending anyone. Doesn't anymore remember the old saying, \"You can't please all of the people, all of the time!\" Suddenly, everyone thinks they get to always have their way no matter what because otherwise, I'm offended!","p062","p055",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
5123,201,207,16,"Person 1","Yeah, it's just crazy.  Even the people who believe that's how it should be can't help offending people.  There's always someone who's going to be offended.  We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims.","p062","p055",3.3333,2,2,2.6667
5124,201,207,17,"Person 2","It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did.","p062","p055",3.6667,2,1.6667,3
5125,201,207,18,"Person 1","Absolutely.  And the ultimate irony is that by trying to make everyone's life struggle-free, we increase their struggles by making everyone less capable of dealing with them.  We know it's unhealthy and unproductive to treat kids like this, make them soft and feeble.  It's not just silly, it's actually detrimental to the people we're trying to protect.","p062","p055",3.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
5126,201,207,19,"Person 2","Exactly! Instead of letting them learn when they're young and the disappointments are more minor that they can survive not always getting what they want. We let them grow up thinking everything should go their way. Then suddenly, they don't get into the college they want or get the job they want and they can't deal with it.","p062","p055",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
5127,201,207,20,"Person 1","Yeah, it's a bizarre tack we've taken and I wonder when it or if we'll change course.  Anyway, it was great talking with you.  I really enjoyed it.  Hope you have a great day.  bye","p062","p055",2.6667,0,1,2
5128,201,207,21,"Person 2","Was great chatting with you as well. Enjoy your day. goodbye","p062","p055",2,0,0.6667,1.3333
5129,201,208,0,"Person 1","man, that was more than an article. Like several mashed together, but. It really makes you empathetic, don't you think?","p027","p024",2.6667,2,3,1.3333
5130,201,208,1,"Person 2","yeah i agree.","p027","p024",1.3333,1,2.6667,1
5131,201,208,2,"Person 1","people are ddying in the streets. Being slaughtered. Sad is that so many people like it this way.","p027","p024",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2
5132,201,208,3,"Person 2","gun control is needed","p027","p024",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
5133,201,208,4,"Person 1","my solution: all handguns are illegal. You can own two guns by law, eithe a single shot rifle, or a single shot shotgun. No more than those weapons, and only one of each. that's my gun control. will you support it if i write it in a bill?","p027","p024",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
5134,201,208,5,"Person 2","that probably a good idea you cant go on a shooting spree with a single shot","p027","p024",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
5135,201,208,6,"Person 1","its too common sense, though. it would never work","p027","p024",2,2,2,1.3333
5136,201,208,7,"Person 2","common sense never gets passed into law","p027","p024",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
5137,201,208,8,"Person 1","no. all cops should not have guns either. they ahould be trained tode escalate stuff. not just shoot. people like it htough. they like innocent peoplebeing killed they watch too much tv","p027","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
5138,201,208,9,"Person 2","theyre not trained enough period","p027","p024",3,1.6667,2,2.3333
5139,201,208,10,"Person 1","and this stuff has been going on forever. its just not being reported.","p027","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
5140,201,208,11,"Person 2","its just we now have social media and it becomes more known","p027","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
5141,201,208,12,"Person 1","yeah. people have power, but its just more surveilance. its like they tricked us into being walking video amerasso we have no privacy, anyone can moniter anyone anymore. i just wished the innocent black kids and adults wouldn't have to get blown away by rednecks","p027","p024",3.6667,2,2,2.3333
5142,201,208,13,"Person 2","well the only good thing is people know its a problem now at least thats the first step","p027","p024",2.3333,0.3333,2,1.6667
5143,201,208,14,"Person 1","yes. i'm somewhat hopeful. but we're so complacent in usa. we know more about it, but the system is so ingrained, its hard to overcome","p027","p024",2.6667,1,2,1.6667
5144,201,208,15,"Person 2","after reading the article you cant help but feel urgency","p027","p024",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
5145,201,208,16,"Person 1","urgency, and also emotions. for the slain. the impoverished, and the bullied.","p027","p024",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
5146,201,208,17,"Person 2","no doubt about it","p027","p024",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
5147,201,208,18,"Person 1","crazy low IQ militarized force, no consequences for what they do. itsgetting to be more and more militarized. We're losing the battle for our own rights","p027","p024",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
5148,201,208,19,"Person 2","were all being trained to be slaves by the government","p027","p024",2.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
5149,201,208,20,"Person 1","hell, yeah, brother. you know whats up","p027","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1,1
5150,201,208,21,"Person 2","its the only conclusion","p027","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1,1
5151,201,208,22,"Person 1","is that ten turns yet?","p027","p024",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
5152,201,208,23,"Person 2","was a good talk. bye","p027","p024",1,0.3333,0.6667,1
5153,201,208,24,"Person 1","bye","p027","p024",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
5154,201,209,0,"Person 1","This article is a bit old, referencing the 2016 campaign, but it is still poignant and relevant today.","p065","p035",2,1,2,2
5155,201,209,1,"Person 2","I agree. How do you think police and race relations can be handled better?","p065","p035",1,1,1,1
5156,201,209,2,"Person 1","I don't think they can directly. They are symptoms of a larger problem.","p065","p035",2,1,2,3
5157,201,209,3,"Person 2","This is why NFL players were taking a knee.","p065","p035",2,1,1,3
5158,201,209,4,"Person 1","Yes, even though that was co-opted to become about being anti-patriotic...","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5159,201,209,5,"Person 2","I know the police know how to take people in alive, look at most mass shooters.","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5160,201,209,6,"Person 1","True. Now, I believe that there are way more good police than bad, but it's obvious that some people are attracted to police work because it gives them a gun and the license to use it in public without fear of retribution","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5161,201,209,7,"Person 2","I agree that there are good police. I think they should be held to a high standard","p065","p035",2,0,2,3
5162,201,209,8,"Person 1","Yes. Really, again, these are just symptoms though. Most of these social conflicts are really just proxies for the real problem, which is wealth disparity, which leads to scapegoating","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5163,201,209,9,"Person 2","Yeah, most super rich people do not care what happens to people no matter what their race is.","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5164,201,209,10,"Person 1","Yeah, or rather they only care so far as it keeps them entrenched in the 1%","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5165,201,209,11,"Person 2","I always wonder when enough money is enough.","p065","p035",3,2,2,3
5166,201,209,12,"Person 1","Well, it's tough, because competition and profit fuels development, but it's a fact that wages have been stagnate (or even dropped against the value of the dollar) since the mid-90s","p065","p035",2,2,2,3
5167,201,209,13,"Person 2","Jeff Bezos could pay more, but he rather see the fake number go up in his bank account.","p065","p035",3,2,3,4
5168,201,209,14,"Person 1","Ha, oh, that number is very real...","p065","p035",2,1,2,1
5169,201,209,15,"Person 2","Can he withdraw 75 billion dollars?. At some point it is just a number in account. I see your point too.","p065","p035",3,1,3,3
5170,201,209,16,"Person 1","Yeah, all you need to know about what Bezos thinks of people is look at mturk: we're all busting our butts in bubble hell to sniff minimum wage - but, at least I can do it in my robe...","p065","p035",3,2,3,2
5171,201,209,17,"Person 2","Do you think all this class,race is just part of the human condition?","p065","p035",1,1,1,1
5172,201,209,18,"Person 1","That's an interesting question. Probably. I often say that if you want to know what humanity is about, just look around at what we do. We are what we do. But, a lot of it is due to developing in a climate of scarcity, where there is the perception that there are not enough to go around (which really should not be true anymore).","p065","p035",2,2,3,3
5173,201,209,19,"Person 2","I agree. I think people are just scared to let their guard down because they do not want to lose what they have.","p065","p035",2,2,3,3
5174,201,209,20,"Person 1","Yes. It's tough. But, what is going to happen in 20 years when automation, robotics, and AI eliminates A LOT of jobs. WE're already nearing a tipping point. What happens when there are simply not enough jobs for people anymore?","p065","p035",2,2,3,3
5175,201,209,21,"Person 2","Hopefully universal basic income.","p065","p035",1,0,2,1
5176,201,209,22,"Person 1","Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Basically, a form of socialism, but it's hard to get there without a real economic collapse. As long as it functions somewhat, then we're stuck with the current economic model, which means more racial scapegoating and more violence.","p065","p035",2,2,3,1
5177,201,209,23,"Person 2","Sadly I have to agree with you. Most American think health care is not a right.","p065","p035",3,2,3,2
5178,201,209,24,"Person 1","Yeah, and that's the problem. We're just content with what we're given.","p065","p035",2,2,3,2
5179,201,209,25,"Person 2","Police departments and Fire departments are forms of socialism but people don't complain about them.","p065","p035",2,2,3,1
5180,201,209,26,"Person 1","Yeah, our values are just out of whack. But, again, it is who we are. We want to point a finger at some 'other', some boogeyman, because it's easier and safer than point a finger at a crooked system, because that seems like too big of a problem to solve.","p065","p035",2,2,3,1
5181,201,209,27,"Person 2","The government has long stopped working in the interest of the common man.","p065","p035",2,2,2,1
5182,201,209,28,"Person 1","True, but it's not just the government, it's everything, all of it. The whole structure and processes of society. It's a massive problem that will only be solved if we reach some crisis that necessitates huge change.","p065","p035",3,2,2,1
5183,201,209,29,"Person 2","Climate change or an asteroid.","p065","p035",1,2,2,1
5184,201,209,30,"Person 1","Yes, something at that level. People won't change unless their comfort is threatened. It doesn't have to be existential, but big enough to rattle everyone.","p065","p035",3,2,2,1
5185,201,209,31,"Person 2","Do you think police should be enforcing laws dealing with what an adult does with their own body?","p065","p035",1,1,1,1
5186,201,209,32,"Person 1","Well, I think there are way too many laws governing personal behavior. Most things that do not directly harm others should be legal. Abortion. Suicide. Gambling. Prostitution. Some drugs. Legalize, regulate and tax. The problem isn't the act themselves, it's the criminality, which breeds abuse and exploitation, because where can you turn if you know that what you're doing could get you locked up?","p065","p035",3,2,2,1
5187,201,209,33,"Person 2","I can see how see how some women can be forced into prostitution. I believe all drugs should be legal. I would hate for one of my children to overdose, but I would also hate for one of my children to die from a heart attack from eating Big Macs all day which is not illegal.","p065","p035",3,2,2,2
5188,201,209,34,"Person 1","Yes, that's right. Our society shouldn't punish people for making what others would deem to be a mistake. It should be more forgiving and permissive. Drug addition should not be a criminal matter - it should be viewed as a public health matter.","p065","p035",2,0,3,2
5189,201,209,35,"Person 2","Do you think we should make police less militarized?","p065","p035",1,1,1,1
5190,201,209,36,"Person 1","Probably, but I also think that there should be way more police. And, yeah, the role of police should shift away from 'catching bad guys' to supporting communities.","p065","p035",3,0,2,1
5191,201,209,37,"Person 2","Like back in the day when they knew the people's names in the community.","p065","p035",2,0,2,1
5192,201,209,38,"Person 1","Yes, exactly - I also think that police should live in the precincts they work in.","p065","p035",2,0,3,1
5193,201,209,39,"Person 2","I agree with that.","p065","p035",2,1,1,1
5194,201,209,40,"Person 1","Well, ti was really cool chatting with you. I don't know if we solved any of society's problems, but it was fun. goodbye","p065","p035",2,1,2,1
5195,201,209,41,"Person 2","Great chatting with you too! goodbye","p065","p035",0,1,0,1
5196,201,210,0,"Person 1","I think the whole trigger happy law enforcement situation in America is kinda messed up. What do you think?","p007","p060",3,2,3,2
5197,201,210,1,"Person 2","I agree. I think it is completely out of hand. It is a hard situation to fix though, so many people think the police can do no wrong.","p007","p060",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
5198,201,210,2,"Person 1","For real. I live in the south and minorities are profiled constantly. An officer was just removed from the force in Chattanooga because he profiled a man just sitting on his porch and ende dup shooting the poor guy and his dog.","p007","p060",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
5199,201,210,3,"Person 2","I can't even imagine what it must be like to be black and have to deal with the cops I would be so scared all the time. I never realized how lucky I was in all my dealings with the police in my life.","p007","p060",3.6667,2,3.6667,3
5200,201,210,4,"Person 1","Yea around here if you are white the cops don't care unless you are dealing drugs. It is pretty sad that I can wlak alone at 3am and they dont care but as soon as they see a black guy hes getting searched.","p007","p060",3,2,3,3
5201,201,210,5,"Person 2","There was a big case here in New York, some poor guy was selling bootleg cigarettes on the corner in New York City and the cops arrested him. The guy was kind of big I guess and they were scared of him so they wound up choking him to death. For selling illegal cigarettes. The cops got to keep their jobs too I think. White people here mostly think the cops are perfect so nothing will ever change","p007","p060",3,2,3,2.6667
5202,201,210,6,"Person 1","Around here everyone doesn't like cops. They are shady. There have meen many cases of them being removed from the force; plus cases of people impersonating them to do messed up stuff. Oh and the excessive force.","p007","p060",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
5203,201,210,7,"Person 2","It's good that they are at least being held accountable. Know what really blows my mind, is that until a few years ago when the Trayvon Martin case happened, no one even knew these things were happening. I never would have believed that cops were murdering black people for no reason. It's so crazy that  everyone ignored what was happening","p007","p060",3,1.3333,2,2.6667
5204,201,210,8,"Person 1","Yea people tend to ignore things when it isn't happening to them personally or when it is swept under the rug. I just wish we as a whole weren't so prejudice towards eachother. It's dumb we're all people who cares about what ethnicity we are.","p007","p060",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
5205,201,210,9,"Person 2","I agree. It just seems to be getting worse. There are so many people who I would have sworn were not racist, and now they very clearly are. I guess they were all in hiding waiting until they felt safe enough acting racist. It's terrible. I don't know how it can't be fixed","p007","p060",3,2,2,2.3333
5206,201,210,10,"Person 1","Yea lately there seems to be these emerging polar opposite sides in society. And both sides take things too far. Violence isn't the answer people. Ghandi and MLK did a ton without ever raising a hand against anyone. Things now adays are getting so far out of hand with all these shootings and riots.","p007","p060",3.3333,2,2,1.6667
5207,201,210,11,"Person 2","I always think about what would happen if everyone just went blind tomorrow. We wouldn't be able to see what anyone looked like. We would actually have to judge people on meaningful things other than their skin tone of their body shape. I mean obviously it would be terrible to not be able to see, but its interesting to think about.","p007","p060",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
5208,201,210,12,"Person 1","If only we could actually act like that. Here in the south it is disgusting how people act towards eachother. I hear nbombs constantly. People always judge you by how you look. Especially the older people. They can be the worst. I remember being in a grocery store once and an older man wouldn't go through the checkout line unless it was a white girl ringing him up. caused a big scene voer something so stupid.","p007","p060",3,2,2.3333,3.3333
5209,201,210,13,"Person 2","Wow that is so obnoxious. It is amazing people like that have made it this long without getting into a ton of fights everywhere they go","p007","p060",3.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
5210,201,210,14,"Person 1","I know right? God cops though of all people need to practice being non biased. They're supposed to protect people not shoot up people because of their skin color.","p007","p060",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
5211,201,210,15,"Person 2","What do you think would even help the situation at this point?","p007","p060",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1
5212,201,210,16,"Person 1","I'm not sure. It really just comes down to us human beings not being trash. Maybe some stricter laws or soemthing pertaining to when you can actually shoot someone as a cop. But yea i really don't know.","p007","p060",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
5213,201,210,17,"Person 2","I agree. People really are terrible. Hopefully as all the older people leave this planet the younger people can act differently, but it isn't looking too promising","p007","p060",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
5214,201,210,18,"Person 1","Yea. I don't wish death on the older people but theya re so stuck in their ways that I don't think we can make positive change until 20ish years in the future..","p007","p060",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
5215,201,210,19,"Person 2","Well I meant as they die naturally, I dopnt","p007","p060",2,1,0.6667,1
5216,201,210,20,"Person 1","Oh haha sorry I misunderstood. Anyway it's been a great convo random turker! Have a great rest of the day c: goodbye!","p007","p060",2.3333,0,0.3333,1
5217,201,210,21,"Person 2","Sorry my last message got cut off because I pressed enter too soon ! Have a great day. goodbye","p007","p060",2,0.6667,0.3333,1
5218,273,211,0,"Person 1","This whole situation just sucks.  I can see things from both parties perspectives.  I hope it gets cleared up without any casualties.","p063","p073",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
5219,273,211,1,"Person 2","I completely agree with you, neither side is purposefully trying to hurt the other. It seems that the oil people would have more resources to figure something out than the Native Americans.","p063","p073",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
5220,273,211,2,"Person 1","So you're saying the oil people should move the pipeline, or determine some other means of remedy?","p063","p073",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
5221,273,211,3,"Person 2","I just think that they might be able to figure something out. They probably have a lot more resources and money.","p063","p073",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.6667
5222,273,211,4,"Person 1","That's probably true.  Divert it somewhere.  I wonder what the costs would be though?  We'll probably never know.","p063","p073",2,1,2,2.3333
5223,273,211,5,"Person 2","I feel horribly for the Native Americans though. This seems to really be threatening their way of life.","p063","p073",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
5224,273,211,6,"Person 1","Possibly, whenever I see how the article states there are native americans, and protestors, it makes me wonder how much of this is a feigned movement by radical lefters.","p063","p073",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
5225,273,211,7,"Person 2","Yeah, like the MAGA hat kid story","p063","p073",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
5226,273,211,8,"Person 1","Exactly.  I hate to get like this, but I don't trust a word from the media anymore.  They'll frame anything to get the point across that they want to.","p063","p073",3,2,1,3
5227,273,211,9,"Person 2","Totally agreed! And I had not read the article closely enough. I thought the Native Americans were protesting themselves. I didn't realize they were there with the environmental activists.","p063","p073",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5228,273,211,10,"Person 1","Yeah I don't remember verbatim, but that's basically what was said.  \"Around 150 Native Americans and protestors\", or something like that.  It reminds me of when there was that huge backlash against the Washington Redskins, and that name being derogatory.  But over 95% of Native Americans polled said they didn't care, and many schools in reserves were named the Redskins... Just interest groups deciding to be upset about something.","p063","p073",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3
5229,273,211,11,"Person 2","If that is the case though, even more sad for the Native Americans that are being used by the activists and getting hurt in the protests.","p063","p073",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
5230,273,211,12,"Person 1","True.  Either way you look at it, Native Americans have been getting shit on in this country for like 500 years.","p063","p073",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
5231,273,211,13,"Person 2","So true.","p063","p073",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
5232,273,211,14,"Person 1","I guess with that being said, maybe I am more in favor of them changing the pipeline somehow.  Even if there is just a small chance of leaking, maybe the NA's have been f'd with enough.","p063","p073",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5233,273,211,15,"Person 2","If there is a way to do it and avoid going through that land, that might be the best thing to do.","p063","p073",2,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5234,273,211,16,"Person 1","Yeah.  I wonder if any of the oil bigwigs have discussed that at all, or if they're just planning on ompletly muscling these people, knowing they have the support of the Government.","p063","p073",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
5235,273,211,17,"Person 2","I would think the protests might have them thinking a little about it at least. But I think it said the land was owned by the federal government, but the Native Americans thought they had some right to it because of some treaty.","p063","p073",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
5236,273,211,18,"Person 1","If I remember correctly, the land itself is owned by the government, but the problem would be if the the pipeline burst.  If that happened, oil would seep into the groundwater, and pollute the (sacred) lake that the NA's use.","p063","p073",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
5237,273,211,19,"Person 2","That makes sense. It seems that there should be a way to make it safe so that the Native Americans are ok with it. And it could help them get jobs too.","p063","p073",2,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
5238,273,211,20,"Person 1","That's true.  That would be a good olive branch.  Not only would they have jobs, but also maybe have an opportunity to ensure that the pipe is done well, and minmize any chance of pipe failure.","p063","p073",2.3333,0,3,2.6667
5239,273,211,21,"Person 2","That is a great idea!","p063","p073",3,0,1.6667,1
5240,273,211,22,"Person 1","It would probably just be an issue of whether they have any of the qualifications.  I'm sure at least the labor jobs they could assist.","p063","p073",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
5241,273,211,23,"Person 2","It's been great talking to you!","p063","p073",2.3333,0,1.3333,1
5242,273,211,24,"Person 1","same to you!","p063","p073",2,0,1,1
5243,273,211,25,"Person 2","bye!","p063","p073",1,0.6667,0.6667,1

5246,273,212,1,"Person 2","True. but I dont believe one should be above the law","p024","p000",1.6667,1.6667,1,2
5247,273,212,2,"Person 1","im with the protestors here we already took enough of the native americans land","p024","p000",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
5248,273,212,3,"Person 2","true but there are other forms of protest.","p024","p000",2,1.6667,1,1.6667
5249,273,212,4,"Person 1","what about the protest rubbed you the wrong way?","p024","p000",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.3333
5250,273,212,5,"Person 2","The protest itself didnt rub me the wrong way. the way the police handled it wasnt prob not the greatest esp when they shot the horse","p024","p000",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
5251,273,212,6,"Person 1","yeah i didnt see them do anything wrong but the police on the other hand..","p024","p000",2,1.6667,3,2
5252,273,212,7,"Person 2","I agree that it was handled in a very wrong manner, and the police officers showing up in the riot gear was interesting","p024","p000",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
5253,273,212,8,"Person 1","riot gear to fight the tough elderly people i guess","p024","p000",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
5254,273,212,9,"Person 2","it felt like they went there expecting a fight.","p024","p000",2,2,2.3333,2
5255,273,212,10,"Person 1","yeah i wonder why","p024","p000",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
5256,273,212,11,"Person 2","I wonder if it had to do with the media hype of the protest and they expected more backlash. not sure","p024","p000",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
5257,273,212,12,"Person 1","probably. fox news tends to overblow things","p024","p000",2,2,1.6667,2
5258,273,212,13,"Person 2","Thats the truth, I mean yea, they needed to be cleared, but the aggressiveness of the round up was too much","p024","p000",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
5259,273,212,14,"Person 1","maybe they can learn from this as a police department","p024","p000",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
5260,273,212,15,"Person 2","That should definately be looked into as a state training. because it wasnt just one dept that rounded them up","p024","p000",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
5261,273,212,16,"Person 1","i feel cops need to be trained more in all states","p024","p000",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5262,273,212,17,"Person 2","I dont think its all police but there has been a uptick in fresh recruits and I think that the new recruit in this day and day are not properly trained to handle situtations","p024","p000",2,2,1.3333,2.6667
5263,273,212,18,"Person 1","most cops are great but the bad ones ruin it for the rest","p024","p000",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
5264,273,212,19,"Person 2","I agree it casts a shadow that is really hard to get out of esp.","p024","p000",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
5265,273,212,20,"Person 1","yeah with youtube and phone cameras its tough","p024","p000",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
5266,273,212,21,"Person 2","Our local dept all have cameras. But I really like the fact they have live PD and things like that. But social media has made the job way harder, because you only hear 1 side of the story","p024","p000",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
5267,273,212,22,"Person 1","live PD is a great show. Yeah, cop body cameras are great but I feel like they can be better","p024","p000",1.6667,0,2,2
5268,273,212,23,"Person 2","I think the mouths of the officers on the show need to be better, but I know if a cop told me stop or be shot, I would be stopping","p024","p000",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,3
5269,273,212,24,"Person 1","the problem is a shot being a cops first option instead of something less lethal. esp when the suspect has no weapon","p024","p000",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
5270,273,212,25,"Person 2","That is very true.","p024","p000",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
5271,273,212,26,"Person 1","yeah i always wondered why theyre trained that way","p024","p000",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
5272,273,212,27,"Person 2","I believe its because the one time you dont, it can cost you your life. But one life is not greater than another","p024","p000",2,1.3333,2,2
5273,273,212,28,"Person 1","i agree with that. its been a great talk i enjoyed it. bye","p024","p000",1.6667,0,1,1.3333

5275,273,213,0,"Person 1","I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate articles in their personalizd inboxes in ways that relate to them through working means, and however as mTurk workers working remotely sometimes our means to relate are removed, and this relates to this message I received from this article.","p018","p039",3,1.5,1.3333,2.3333
5276,273,213,1,"Person 2","What do you mean?","p018","p039",1.3333,1,0.3333,1
5277,273,213,2,"Person 1","I mean that if I were ordering through a produce app on my smart phone, because I work remotely online as a contractor, my personlized internet of things will probably make it so that I don't even know the farmer or where the goods come from or whatever.","p018","p039",2,1,1,2
5278,273,213,3,"Person 2","Yes but how is this related to the article?","p018","p039",1.3333,1,0.3333,1
5279,273,213,4,"Person 1","Like there are ladders in place in society that keep everything in check, and somehow by working more incorporated (in my opinion) we have lost the ladder? Did they spill into the water supply in cohort with the protest? These are things that can make sense in order to bring a light to us stuck on the edge, but I don't see the relation and what it means to us.","p018","p039",2.3333,1,2,2

5283,273,213,8,"Person 1","Like that makes sense if this is supposed to be a how to discussion guide on how to relate to workers anywhere, but then what about the ladder they removed that allowed them to spill.","p018","p039",1.6667,1,1.3333,1

5301,273,214,1,"Person 2","I feel sorry for the people, but I don't think these protests are appropriate at all.

5338,273,215,18,"Person 1","Really? I hear about this story but I have not followed it very well","p019","p068",2,1,2,1.6667
5339,273,215,19,"Person 2","Oh yeah I believe so that is what i heard and many people were so sad","p019","p068",3,1.6667,3,1.3333
5340,273,215,20,"Person 1","That sukcs...","p019","p068",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
5341,273,215,21,"Person 2","it was great chatting with you!","p019","p068",2,0.3333,0.6667,1
5342,273,215,22,"Person 1","you as well! bye","p019","p068",2,0.3333,0.6667,1
5343,273,215,23,"Person 2","bye","p019","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
5344,247,216,0,"Person 1","I thought about this in a while. Really makes you think about all the tragedies that newer stuff just pushes out of the way","p027","p062",3.3333,1.6667,3,2
5345,247,216,1,"Person 2","Yes, we have short memories now.  One tragedy or threat or whatever replaces another with great speed.","p027","p062",2,1,2.6667,1.6667
5346,247,216,2,"Person 1","i thnk that we're just bombarded with new information about everything that it just becomes a list ofstuff that's horrible after a while","p027","p062",3,1.6667,2,2
5347,247,216,3,"Person 2","Yes, I worry at what point we collectively stop caring.  Is the world a better place because I learn about some school bus that crashes in some part of the world I know nothing about?  That sounds callous but the world is incomprehensibly large.  We can't concern ourselves with the fate of all 7 billion people.","p027","p062",3.3333,2,2.6667,3
5348,247,216,4,"Person 1","callus is right. The more we go on learning of this stuff, it builds up like a callus, or it eats so far into you. bad to say, but it feels like if a certain number of people don't get murdered, then its not worth my attention. that's horrible","p027","p062",3,2,2,2.6667
5349,247,216,5,"Person 2","One thing in the story that stuck out to me was the band that played the show that got attacked.  I'd feel awful for the rest of my life if that had been my band.  People came to MY show.  I WANTED them to come to MY show.  And they ended up dead or traumatized because of it.  I'd feel devastated by that.","p027","p062",3.6667,2,3.3333,3.3333
5350,247,216,6,"Person 1","yeah. i didn't even consider that. they were there to see them. the reason for showing up. Damn.","p027","p062",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
5351,247,216,7,"Person 2","The response of France also sounded a lot like a U.S. response to a similar event.  The government claims more power to insure safety.  Backlash against Muslims increases for a time.  People mourn.  It could have been America after 9/11.  My point is, people are largely people, even though other countries like to paint the U.S. as different.  Of course it is in ways, but we're also just all people.","p027","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
5352,247,216,8,"Person 1","stuff gets taken advantage of. People's lives get turned into politcal tools by the charasmatic sociopaths who govern us. Its in a lot of people's interest to drive us apart. It's like in in prince machevelia or somehting.","p027","p062",3,2,1.6667,2.6667
5353,247,216,9,"Person 2","Yeah, I agree.  There's a lot of that.  Apropos your original point, I sort of can't remember the last time a Western country had one of these events.  (I'm not including the \"domestic terrorism\" of mass shootings in the U.S.)  I wonder if we're due, or if it's a sign the terrorists are losing or we're just getting really capable at preventing this stuff.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
5354,247,216,10,"Person 1","boston bombing. somehting like that. It gets scary to see the reaction of militarized force to thos ehtings. I don't want to live in a country like that. But I don't know about being due, I don't think this stuff happens a lot of the time, and when it does it isn't preventable even more of the time, it's just the response the draconia militarization that comes aftwerward creating the illusion of safety","p027","p062",3,1.6667,2,3
5355,247,216,11,"Person 2","I was in Washington D.C. after 9/11.  It was always eerie driving past the Pentagon and other areas and seeing humvees with guided missiles pointing to the sky.","p027","p062",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,3
5356,247,216,12,"Person 1","people seem so eager to lose that freedom if you pretend they're safe. Terrorism in america, when we're not talking about mass shooters is nearly nonexistent, but we still need tanks in the street for some reason.","p027","p062",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
5357,247,216,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I find with a lot of these issues that we lose perspective.  The world becomes so small when we distill it down to extreme events and watch it on a screen.  But the world is incomprehensibly large.  This country is.  A state is, even a city.  I'm sure right now a lot of parents are sincerely worried about sending their kids to school.  The reality is that they're more likely to win the lottery than ever experience someone they love getting killed in a mass shooting.","p027","p062",3,1.3333,2,3
5358,247,216,14,"Person 1","exactly. But fear is a great manipulator. People are taken advantage of, told constantly that they're going to be in danger so they can watch more tv, or buy whatever, or vote a certain way, and it just creates chaos.","p027","p062",3.3333,2,1.6667,2.6667
5359,247,216,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or even an improvement.  We seem hell-bent on running towards a world of greater and greater manipulation.  We joke about \"1984\" and that type of dystopia and yet we can't put down our phones.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
5360,247,216,16,"Person 1","its hard for a lot of people, i understand that. You get like postive rewards, doepamine or whatever in a constant rush by seeing whats on your phone. It all goes hand in hand, tools of addiction, manipulation, fear. You don't want to trust anyone, everyone's a serial killer, or a rapist pedophile, or a terrorist, and if you talk about love or empathy, or trust, you're a weak retard who lives in a fantasy world. I can change myself, but by and large this is the way people are being shaped as a whole. I feel despondent or whatever.","p027","p062",3,2,1.6667,3
5361,247,216,17,"Person 2","Yeah, it's hard.  But I think that feeling of despondency is probably shared by many people, in various ways and for various reasons.  We see too much of the world now.  We recognize our own futility and insignificance and impotence more than ever.  I think our brains are designed to live in smaller worlds, worlds we feel in more control of.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
5362,247,216,18,"Person 1","i thinkthat's true","p027","p062",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
5363,247,216,19,"Person 2","I agree.  I also think what I said is true.  Maybe.","p027","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
5364,247,216,20,"Person 1","this is a good chat, but we're in too deep and my repoies are taking up too much time. You seem like a classy individual, thought. bye","p027","p062",2,0.3333,0.6667,1.6667
5365,247,216,21,"Person 2","Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye","p027","p062",2,0.3333,0.6667,1

5368,247,217,2,"Person 1","Sadly nothing. There are too many people to control everything. What do you think?","p035","p024",3,2,1.3333,1.6667
5369,247,217,3,"Person 2","its tough I have no idea either","p035","p024",2.6667,1.6667,0.6667,1.3333
5370,247,217,4,"Person 1","It would break my heart to find out my child died on social media.","p035","p024",4,2,3.6667,2

5372,247,217,6,"Person 1","I'm glad he said he was finding some peace in the things he was doing to honor his daughter","p035","p024",2.6667,0.6667,3,1.6667

5374,247,217,8,"Person 1","Do you think publishing the cartoon was the right thing to do.","p035","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
5375,247,217,9,"Person 2","can you elaborate? dont think I read about that in the article","p035","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
5376,247,217,10,"Person 1","The cartoon drawing of Muhammad","p035","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
5377,247,217,11,"Person 2","if that was the reason they attacked I think one shouldnt mess with peoples religions so it was not the right thing to do.","p035","p024",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
5378,247,217,12,"Person 1","I agree. I think attacking is too far, but you should not play with someones religion. Plus the people at the concert did not do the drawing.","p035","p024",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
5379,247,217,13,"Person 2","yeah its like youre taunting them to do it","p035","p024",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
5380,247,217,14,"Person 1","I agree with you.","p035","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
5381,247,217,15,"Person 2","most of the time in these things innocent people die which is terrible","p035","p024",3.3333,2,2,1.3333
5382,247,217,16,"Person 1","I also did not like how people blame the actions on all Muslims.","p035","p024",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5383,247,217,17,"Person 2","yeah it tends to happen which is bad","p035","p024",2.3333,2,0.6667,1.6667

5443,247,219,4,"Person 1","there seemed to have been a lot of attacks around that time","p009","p006",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
5444,247,219,5,"Person 2","Absolutely crazy how many people died due the coordinated events. I remember i was at the library at the time and reading upon the events. I cannot imagine the pain the families were and are in then and now.","p009","p006",4,2,2.6667,2.3333

5446,247,219,7,"Person 2","Terrifying. I wonder what has been done since then to protect the public from such attacks.","p009","p006",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5447,247,219,8,"Person 1","i am not sure, the aria grande attacks were arounf that same time i believe","p009","p006",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.3333

5451,247,219,12,"Person 1","i wish things like that would just not happen","p009","p006",3.3333,1.6667,2,2
5452,247,219,13,"Person 2","It's interesting to see the different types of terror attacks the occur between both the US and Europe. The US having the one man terror attacks and abroad having a more group coordinated type.  Horrible overall.","p009","p006",4,2,2.6667,2
5453,247,219,14,"Person 1","yeah i agree, i would like it all to stop","p009","p006",3,1,2.6667,2

5463,247,220,4,"Person 1","its an unfortunate event and believe improvement in security against terrorism should be in place","p044","p060",2.6667,2,3,2
5464,247,220,5,"Person 2","It is terrible. I have gone to many concerts in my life and I never had to worry about being shot. It is scary that we all have to worry about that now.","p044","p060",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
5465,247,220,6,"Person 1","yeah such an event isn't what one should experience","p044","p060",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
5466,247,220,7,"Person 2","It seems like any public event isn't safe anymore. A few weeks ago there was a shooting at a garlic festival in California. There were families there. It is so sad","p044","p060",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
5467,247,220,8,"Person 1","I just hope enough support is given to the victims of such events","p044","p060",2.6667,0.6667,3.3333,2
5468,247,220,9,"Person 2","The beginning of the article talked about a victims dad finding out his daughter was dead. It said he found out over social media. I can't imagine how scary it must be not to know if your child is alive.","p044","p060",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
5469,247,220,10,"Person 1","very true... its a terrible thing to happen to someone. i just hope the security system gets better","p044","p060",3,2,3,2

5471,247,220,12,"Person 1","same here.. well that's left to the security agencies to figure out","p044","p060",2.3333,1,2,1.3333
5472,247,220,13,"Person 2","Can you imagine being one of the people who were hiding in the venue. It said they hid for over an hour while hearing gunshots. That must have been so scary","p044","p060",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
5473,247,220,14,"Person 1","i really can't imagine such. the screams of pain and agony for over an hour .that's like a life time trauma","p044","p060",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333

5476,247,220,17,"Person 2","It is so true. I am worried for everyone in the world. If humans are able to kill each other so easily things are only going to get worse.","p044","p060",3,2,2.3333,2.3333

5482,417,221,3,"Person 2","No, but I could relate to the idea of losing a pet unexpectedly.  Have any of your pets or children or family members ever been shot in front of you?","p027","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

5486,417,221,7,"Person 2","As for the story, I sympathize with the woman but I also think it's unacceptable to have your dog off the leash like that.  I'm not saying the guy needed to kill it, but I find it wholly unacceptable to expose people to uncontrolled dogs, especially in environments where they're not allowed to be off their leashes.","p027","p062",3.3333,2,2,2.3333
5487,417,221,8,"Person 1","yeah. Keep your dog on a leash. Being a pet owner is responsibility. But also, it's so stupid people can just walk around strapped like its the wild west, looking to blow something away.","p027","p062",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
5488,417,221,9,"Person 2","It certainly makes you think about those times when you want to tell someone off or flip someone off.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
5489,417,221,10,"Person 1","I don't want to do that because I'm a good person. I don't have a lot of concern for dead animals though. They're basically replacable. Disposable. I'm sure the woman felt bad for a week, maybe, then got a cool new puppy.","p027","p062",2.3333,2,1.6667,3
5490,417,221,11,"Person 2","Yeah, but there are practical concerns, like having to think up a new name for the puppy.  That's sort of an unnecessary burden, it seems.","p027","p062",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5491,417,221,12,"Person 1","Yeah. I guess? ? That guy that shot the dog, though. I feel the worst for him. He's definetly going to shoot a family member or friend by accident.","p027","p062",3,2,2.3333,1.6667
5492,417,221,13,"Person 2","Do you feel sorry for him because of what you think he'll feel after he does that?","p027","p062",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
5493,417,221,14,"Person 1","Sorry he's such a friend moron he goes around armed. Sad for the person he's going to maim or kill. No winners here.","p027","p062",3.6667,2,2,1.6667
5494,417,221,15,"Person 2","I see.  Yeah, I guess I sort of don't understand the mentality of a guy like that, so I'm not sure I understand the situations when he'd use his gun.  I thought the most peculiar sentence in the article was when they said they walked by the two dog owners and one of the people (presumably the wife) apologized for their loss.  That just seemed wildly strange and ironice.","p027","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
5495,417,221,16,"Person 1","Sounds like a person going through the motions of saying somehting they don't mean, ust to be polite or whatever.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
5496,417,221,17,"Person 2","Absolutely.  I think that's right.  But it's so unbelievable, why bother to even say it.  I'm sort of surprised the dog owner didn't lose her mind.  Maybe she was scared of getting shot herself.  And she was also focused on her dying dog, of course.","p027","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
5497,417,221,18,"Person 1","She was for sure afraid of this clint eastwood wannabe putting some holes in her. She's probably gonna have therapy after seeing that. Or maybe she doesn't even mind anymore,. what do i know?","p027","p062",2.6667,2,2,2
5498,417,221,19,"Person 2","I saw a woman's child get run over by a car once.  The child was lying in the street (long story) and the car's tire went right over its abdomen.  The woman's first instinct was not to check on her child, who was still under the car, but to bang on the guy's windows to complain.  I thought that was interesting.","p027","p062",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
5499,417,221,20,"Person 1","I think getting mad is a normal reaction. If you can blame someone for somehting, then its like it takes the burden off of you somehow, it's like you don't have to be in control, or take resposibility if you can just blame it all on someone else, even if it was there fault or whatever.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
5500,417,221,21,"Person 2","I agree, but I would have thought her motherly instinct would have been to focus on the child first.  Apparently not.","p027","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5501,417,221,22,"Person 1","if you're not a in control, take charge type, you can just say look at what you did, you did something wrong, you fix it. You pay for it, because its beyond my control.","p027","p062",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
5502,417,221,23,"Person 2","Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a nice day.  bye","p027","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1,1

5504,417,222,0,"Person 1","In my opinion, the man was totally within his rights.  That dog should have been on a leash plus the owner failed to restrain it when it attacked him.  I'm fed up with people being inconsiderate of others and having unleashed dogs in public places that endanger the safety of others.  What if it had been a child?","p029","p064",4.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
5505,417,222,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I do agree that it is annoying when people don't follow the rules and just let their unleashed and very bad dogs in a park. I have left parks before because I have 2 small children and do not want unleashed dogs around them","p029","p064",3.6667,2,2,3
5506,417,222,2,"Person 1","Same here.  I have three small children and a teen and I don't want aggressive unleashed dogs around any of them.  Not to mention, and this is less serious, but we had to leave a park just recently bc someone's dog was pooping everywhere and they were just leaving it.  My toddlers could crawl into that and get it on their hands.  Disgusting.  So inconsiderate.","p029","p064",3.6667,2,1.3333,3.3333
5507,417,222,3,"Person 2","Yes, I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old, its enough having to watch them around water since we live by the beach. People just let their dogs go unleashed all the time and then they run towards my children and you don't know if these dogs are up to date on their vaccinations either","p029","p064",3,2,1.6667,3
5508,417,222,4,"Person 1","Oh yeah, that's totally unacceptable.  I just feel like people should be more considerate about their pets and other people.  Just have them on a leash and clean up their waste, plus take them into non-trafficked areas when they need to go.  The article also doesn't even mention the breed of the dog, I don't think, not that it really matters.  It was uncool regardless.","p029","p064",3.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
5509,417,222,5,"Person 2","I looked up the article and it was a very big black lab. Also the dog was dancing around the man, so it was going to attack him","p029","p064",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
5510,417,222,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I would have been scared myself.  You just never know with a dog.  I read things in the paper all the time about attacks.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we don't even go to their house anymore because of it.","p029","p064",3.6667,2,1.6667,3.3333
5511,417,222,7,"Person 2","I have a German Shepard, she is so sweet and is scared of her own shadow but she is never allowed to be alone with the kids. My in laws have 3 (very bad) dogs and they scare me and they are a forth of the size as my dog","p029","p064",3,1.3333,2,3
5512,417,222,8,"Person 1","Theirs is a specially trained attack Czech german shepherd.  It aggressively barks at anyone who approaches it (that is not them) and has issues.  It recently chewed up the wiring on its crate so badly that its teeth were broken.","p029","p064",3.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
5513,417,222,9,"Person 2","Yea that is terrifying. Police dogs are known to attack children too, just because they are trained to kill basically","p029","p064",3.3333,2,2,2
5514,417,222,10,"Person 1","Yeah exactly, and that's exactly what this dog is.  It has really damaged our relationship because we can't bring our kids around them anymore.  My sister doesn't even have kids and she doesn't feel comfortable going over there either.  Crazy.  Picking a dog over family.","p029","p064",4,2,1.6667,3.3333
5515,417,222,11,"Person 2","Yep, as soon as my in laws got their last dog they don't even baby sit anymore and just go googly eyes over a silly dog, kind of weird. They should want to see the grand babies","p029","p064",3.6667,2,1.6667,3
5516,417,222,12,"Person 1","yeah exactly!  it's insulting.  But anyway, it is what it is.","p029","p064",3.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
5517,417,222,13,"Person 2","It is! I would think when I have grand children I would want to see them as much as possible. I was reading up and dog people are freaking out that the guy didn't get charges pressed against him. Face palm","p029","p064",3.3333,2,1.3333,2.6667
5518,417,222,14,"Person 1","Oh I bet they are outraged!!  I was totally expecting to get a dog person defending the man with this HIT and dreading the ensuing conversation.  I would want to see my grandchildren and would easily re-home any pet that was standing in the way of that.","p029","p064",3.6667,2,2,3.3333
5519,417,222,15,"Person 2","Well when i first read it i thought the dog was just playing around and the guy was just shooting the dog because he had a few screws loose but then i looked up the article somewhere else","p029","p064",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
5520,417,222,16,"Person 1","that was a good idea.  I guess I am already slightly biased against dogs bc of the issue with my parents, plus I am always reading about dogs that killed some innocent child or baby.  It breaks my heart.  I know dogs make great pets for some people and I support that but just be responsible and considierate.","p029","p064",3.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
5521,417,222,17,"Person 2","Yea I am kind of in the middle, I know some people are violent against dogs for no reason and that is not acceptable but the dog was definitively going to attack that man.","p029","p064",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
5522,417,222,18,"Person 1","I agree with you that if it is for no reason that is unacceptable.  It is also tragic to read about inncoent dogs being abused or hurt by cruel sick people.  Well thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, I have enjoyed our conversation.  Have a great day.  goodbye","p029","p064",3.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333

5527,417,223,1,"Person 2","She is definitely partially at fault for not keeping her dog on a leash like she was supposed to but at the same time i am unsure if there is really any blame to pass around. All i know is i feel awful for her.","p035","p028",3.3333,2,2,2.6667
5528,417,223,2,"Person 1","I feel bad for the dog and her, but I can not blame the man for shooting the dog","p035","p028",3,1.3333,3,2.3333
5529,417,223,3,"Person 2","I can't blame him either, the way i see it is this is just a sad accident.","p035","p028",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
5530,417,223,4,"Person 1","Yeah, what do you think about the rules of park?","p035","p028",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
5531,417,223,5,"Person 2","I think the rules are perfectly fine, they are clear about no animals of their leashes. Do you think anyone should have been charged or fined?","p035","p028",2,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
5532,417,223,6,"Person 1","No, I support the right to bear arms, but I can not see myself carrying a gun everywhere","p035","p028",2,0.3333,2,2.6667
5533,417,223,7,"Person 2","I agree he was well within his rights and he probably really felt threatened. I could not either but i definitely understand people who do. If i was the owner i don't think i would be able to get another dog after that though.","p035","p028",2.6667,1.3333,3,3
5534,417,223,8,"Person 1","It would take me a long long time to get another dog.","p035","p028",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3
5535,417,223,9,"Person 2","Definitely, i hopefully the owner is able to find peace. At the end of the article it seems like she is coming to terms with it being an accident","p035","p028",3,0,2.6667,2.6667
5536,417,223,10,"Person 1","Yeah, she knew she could not really blame the guy for shooting the dog","p035","p028",2,0.3333,3,2.3333
5537,417,223,11,"Person 2","For sure, but once she comes to terms with not blaming him i hope she does not start to blame herself in anyway.","p035","p028",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
5538,417,223,12,"Person 1","I do not think she needs to become depressed, but it was mainly her fault","p035","p028",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.6667
5539,417,223,13,"Person 2","Yeah, hopefully the only think that comes of this is everyone moves on in their own way.","p035","p028",2,0.3333,1.3333,2
5540,417,223,14,"Person 1","I agree. I really don't think her dog was going to bite him, but was just an excited dog.","p035","p028",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
5541,417,223,15,"Person 2","Yeah most likely just a playful dog. I think if they dog were going to bite it would have lead with barking or given a sign. I wonder if the man has had any bad experiences with dogs in his life that caused him to react.","p035","p028",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.6667
5542,417,223,16,"Person 1","Yeah he could had just been afraid of dogs","p035","p028",1.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667

5553,417,224,1,"Person 2","I too find it that way and annoyed at the claim of the Gun user","p051","p044",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
5554,417,224,2,"Person 1","It seems like many others things could have been done by the other person","p051","p044",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5555,417,224,3,"Person 2","Yeah and not just concluding to just kill the dog","p051","p044",3,2,3,1.6667
5556,417,224,4,"Person 1","Granted the others person broke a leash law, but the death of their pet should not be the punishment for that","p051","p044",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
5557,417,224,5,"Person 2","You are right. i can't imagine losing such a companion","p051","p044",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
5558,417,224,6,"Person 1","The person should be fined severly and lose his conceal and carry permit/liscence for that.","p051","p044",4,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
5559,417,224,7,"Person 2","I wonder if he can murder an individual on such a claim","p051","p044",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
5560,417,224,8,"Person 1","Exactly, hypothtecially if a shady looking person walks up to him in a park to ask for change, would he have gotten away with shooting them as a precaution?","p051","p044",2.6667,2,3,2

5574,417,225,0,"Person 1","I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  For starters, the dog owner should have had her dog on a leash.  She then failed to respond and react when the man repeatedly asked her to restrain her dog.  So he acted to try to defend himself and this is the result.  I find dogs to be highly threatening and can totally understand his actions in this case.  How did you feel about it?","p029","p039",3.3333,1.6667,1,3
5575,417,225,1,"Person 2","I agree with you we need to kill more dogs","p029","p039",3,1.3333,1,2.3333

5577,417,225,3,"Person 2","Yes I personally don't understand why people need to keep violent dogs like pit pbulls","p029","p039",2,1.6667,1,3
5578,417,225,4,"Person 1","OMG thank you, I so strongly agree.  Literally about every week I see a case in the paper where an innocent child or baby or even adults is attacked and killed by some pit bull.  I don't understand how these things are not illegal.  And why do people want them?  IT's a safety hazard and unfair to other people.  It scares me that pit bull owners could move in next door and totally threaten my children's lives and mine.","p029","p039",4,2,1,4
5579,417,225,5,"Person 2","I hate it when the babies get hurt","p029","p039",3,2,2,2.6667
5580,417,225,6,"Person 1","it's totally unacceptable.  If you want a dog, fine, but get a calm family dog that is appropriate and not aggressive or violent.  And keep it on a leash.","p029","p039",3.3333,2,1,2.6667
5581,417,225,7,"Person 2","Yea you should have a fence","p029","p039",2,1.3333,1,2.3333
5582,417,225,8,"Person 1","yeah that should be a legal requirement if you're going to have a dog","p029","p039",2,1.3333,1,2

5584,417,225,10,"Person 1","yeah that's kinda gross.  But I guess a cultural thing.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we dont' even go over to their house because of that stupid dog","p029","p039",3,2,1,3
5585,417,225,11,"Person 2","Yea it is kind of weird would you eat a dog in a survival situation? like walking dead","p029","p039",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
5586,417,225,12,"Person 1","I really don't know.  I guess if I were going to die otherwise I would.  Would you?  I'm kinda picky about meat so this is disgusting to think about.","p029","p039",2.6667,2,1,2.3333
5587,417,225,13,"Person 2","I guess if I had to I would if it was a choice between a dog and people Ill pick the dog lol","p029","p039",2.3333,1,1,2.3333
5588,417,225,14,"Person 1","well yes certainly.  Hopefully it never comes to that.  I do find it a bit alarming that people in countries like Korea or wherever are like breeding dogs just to eat them.  That is foul.  Anyway,","p029","p039",2.6667,2,1,3
5589,417,225,15,"Person 2","haha that is foul I grew up in the hood and that shit is foul","p029","p039",3,1,1,3
5590,417,225,16,"Person 1","Yes it is totally not okay.  Anyway, maybe there should be some restrictions on dogs people are allowed to own.  I would get behind that.","p029","p039",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333
5591,417,225,17,"Person 2","dogs should be banned unless used to hunt other animals","p029","p039",2,1.6667,1,2.6667
5592,417,225,18,"Person 1","I don't really like dogs so I could get behind banning dogs altogether, too.  I doubt that will happen though.  Well it has been great discussing this with you but I must go.  Have a great rest of your day, goodbye","p029","p039",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.6667
5593,417,225,19,"Person 2","goodbye","p029","p039",1,1,0.6667,1
5594,139,226,0,"Person 1","Migration of species always seems to create some sort of problem.","p062","p033",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
5595,139,226,1,"Person 2","it does and in this case our intervention seems to have made it worse","p062","p033",2,2,2,1.6667
5596,139,226,2,"Person 1","Yeah, that's pretty typical.  I think we're usually pretty responsible for this type of thing.  Invasive species, habitat destruction, etc.","p062","p033",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
5597,139,226,3,"Person 2","even with the best of intentions like here, we just end up doing more bad than good","p062","p033",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
5598,139,226,4,"Person 1","I thought the end of the article was interesting.  The scientist was saying, \"We don't want to discourage people from putting in garden ponds, but just be careful about what you put in them.\"  And it's like, is there a problem or not?  Because of this is a problem I don't think we can be telling people they can do it if they want, they just need to be responsible.  That will engender zero change.","p062","p033",2,1.6667,2,2.6667
5599,139,226,5,"Person 2","true, can't really expect a normal person to know that a garden pond he made few weeks ago had damaged frog population in his area. definitely need to educate people more on these things","p062","p033",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
5600,139,226,6,"Person 1","I'm curious about where the amphibians fit into the food chain and whatever in those areas.  I guess small birds and rodents maybe eat them or something.  And they of course eat bugs and stuff.","p062","p033",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
5601,139,226,7,"Person 2","I guess, their diet is mostly insects so maybe they do control the balance of them in nature and then off course they themselves are diet to others such as snakes","p062","p033",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
5602,139,226,8,"Person 1","Talking about mosquito populations would certainly get me to take this issue seriously.","p062","p033",2,1,1.3333,2.6667
5603,139,226,9,"Person 2","oh yes. mosquitoes are just so troublesome so anything to control them should get my vote too. That being said, frogs just seem so harmless and to see them getting killed the way described must be so bad","p062","p033",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
5604,139,226,10,"Person 1","Yeah, I don't mind frogs.  I see them when I go for walks at night and they sometimes scare me because they look like rocks on the road and then they shockingly start moving.  But of course they're just frogs.","p062","p033",1.6667,1,1.3333,3
5605,139,226,11,"Person 2","frogs bring so many good memories for me, when i was a kid and our area would get flooded after rain, we would catch these small fish but only later did i get to know that those were not fish at all","p062","p033",3.3333,0,1.6667,3.3333
5606,139,226,12,"Person 1","That's a great childhood memory.  I used to catch little fish in tide ponds, although they were real fish.","p062","p033",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,3.3333
5607,139,226,13,"Person 2","thinking of this story though, there are those other deadly diseases that we got from the other animals but now they are killing us too","p062","p033",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
5608,139,226,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I think we forget that we're part of the whole natural world and are subject to all these things as well.  This is what happens to species.  They're exposed to new things and they adapt or die.  We're better at adapting to things, but we're still part of that system.","p062","p033",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
5609,139,226,15,"Person 2","And we are mostly running the system but sometimes it just feels that we can never won, there is always some new virus or bacteria that nature throws at us and we start from ground zero again and again","p062","p033",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
5610,139,226,16,"Person 1","Yeah, there will always be something that crops up and threatens us.  And at the same time we're worried about other species too.  We've certainly got a lot of balls in the air.","p062","p033",2,2,1.3333,2.3333
5611,139,226,17,"Person 2","Someone I know recently got sick with one of those superbugs and barely survived. I keep thinking to what will be the future like when those become the norm than the exceptions in hospitals","p062","p033",3,2,1.6667,3
5612,139,226,18,"Person 1","Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, those bugs are scary.  But we haven't succumbed to any major pandemic or epidemic in a while.  So I just have no idea what the likelihood of any of these bugs wiping out major portions of the population are, like Spanish flu and the plague once did.","p062","p033",3,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
5613,139,226,19,"Person 2","Probably very low since we do have some defense even for those. Plagues of old time were just so bad and humans helpless as they did not understood they causes of what was happening and why","p062","p033",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
5614,139,226,20,"Person 1","Yeah, for sure.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye","p062","p033",2,0.3333,0.6667,1
5615,139,226,21,"Person 2","you too. goodbye","p062","p033",2,1,0.6667,1
5616,139,227,0,"Person 1","I feel so bad for all those poor frogs, what do you think should be done to stop the spread of the disease.","p028","p029",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
5617,139,227,1,"Person 2","I think people should just follow some of the guildelines they were giving in the article.  Maybe they should make more of an effort to spread that information.  I felt sad for the frogs but honestly I didn't feel an overwhelming heartbreak or anything.  In general, the ponds seem to be a positive thing for wildlife.","p028","p029",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
5618,139,227,2,"Person 1","Yeah definitely, and it is a good thing that people are more interesting in helping to preserve wildlife with these man made ponds but the side effects of it are upsetting. The scientific community definitely needs to let people know before more of the population gets infected though.","p028","p029",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
5619,139,227,3,"Person 2","Yes I totally agree with you.  LIke they need to put this info out there at shops that carry the items to stock these ponds and in other sources where people can easily find them.  To protect the frogs and the spread of these diseases","p028","p029",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
5620,139,227,4,"Person 1","That would be the best way for sure, wouldn't want it to get to the point where so many of the home ponds would have to be filled.","p028","p029",2,1,2.6667,2
5621,139,227,5,"Person 2","yeah no doubt, that would not be good.  I guess it's just an example of people being careless about things and wildlife suffering as a consequence.  Happens so frequently it's ridiculous","p028","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5622,139,227,6,"Person 1","Yeah it happens way too often, The problem is is that people can't really see outside of their bubble in a way. All these people think is it would be cool to have a pond and buy some frogs to bring in. We need to be better educated on the side effects.","p028","p029",2,1.3333,2.6667,3
5623,139,227,7,"Person 2","yeah exactly!  and I think they mentioned the ornamental fish too.  Did it say it was spreading to them?  Either way, people obviously aren't thinking this stuff through as well as they should.","p028","p029",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5624,139,227,8,"Person 1","I know it mentioned that the disease did not start organically or it did not start in the UK. And for sure but can like the average person really think about something like that happening, i feel like the issue is more so about people not being informed enough when they want to do something like this.","p028","p029",2.3333,1,1.3333,2.3333
5625,139,227,9,"Person 2","yeah, so the key would be more education?  getting people, consumers especially, the information they need to make appropriate choices and protect the species","p028","p029",2,1,1.6667,2
5626,139,227,10,"Person 1","Yeah maybe, building a pond is a pretty big undertaking so at some point during the process somebody should be informing them or giving them the info they need into what they are doing and the harm they could be causing right.","p028","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
5627,139,227,11,"Person 2","Yeah I totally agree.  Whose responsibility do you think it should be to inform people, or do you think the people themselves should be responsible for looking up the information?","p028","p029",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
5628,139,227,12,"Person 1","I think they should definitely get some of the info themselves but i think the shops are also a big part of where they should get the info from.","p028","p029",2,1,1.3333,2.3333
5629,139,227,13,"Person 2","Yes I agree the shops should be a main source.  They're the ones profiting from this whole thing too","p028","p029",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
5630,139,227,14,"Person 1","Exactly, it feels like at some point anyone who wants to build a pond they should come into contact with someone who should be knowledgeable about the current issues and inform them. Maybe require some form of education before you can own something like this?","p028","p029",2.3333,1,2,2
5631,139,227,15,"Person 2","Yeah like a contiuing ed class, it could be offered online","p028","p029",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
5632,139,227,16,"Person 1","Yeah that would be for the best. That way people know the current issues and can help protect the environment. Sadly it doesn't completely solve the issue but it is a step in the right direction","p028","p029",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
5633,139,227,17,"Person 2","Yes I'd like to think it would at least help a little and make a difference","p028","p029",2,0,2.3333,2
5634,139,227,18,"Person 1","For sure it would, i just hope that the UK amphibian population is able to build itself back up once more immune frogs start reproducing.","p028","p029",2,0,3,1.6667
5635,139,227,19,"Person 2","You make a good point about how dire these things can wind up being.  It has been good talking to you.  goodbye","p028","p029",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1
5636,139,227,20,"Person 1","Likewise, goodbye","p028","p029",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1
5637,139,228,0,"Person 1","Who knew backyard ponds could cause so much harm.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
5638,139,228,1,"Person 2","Certainly not me.","p035","p030",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
5639,139,228,2,"Person 1","I knew the pet trade caused bad things for environment and animals","p035","p030",1.3333,1.6667,2,2
5640,139,228,3,"Person 2","Pet trade? I thought the article was more about the transfer of material from human constructs to natural ones?","p035","p030",1,1,2,1.3333
5641,139,228,4,"Person 1","and moving frogs from different ponds to ponds.","p035","p030",1,1,2.3333,1.3333
5642,139,228,5,"Person 2","I guess the pet trade could potentially be involved. Do you know anyone with pet frogs?","p035","p030",1,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
5643,139,228,6,"Person 1","yeah frog are not good pets","p035","p030",1.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
5644,139,228,7,"Person 2","I've always been a bit persnickety about the caging of animals.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
5645,139,228,8,"Person 1","I agree animals shouldn't be caged","p035","p030",2,1.3333,2,2
5646,139,228,9,"Person 2","Honestly, this article lacked some of the emotional appeal that others I have read have had. I mean, I feel for the frogs, but it didn't really offer any solutions to the problem.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
5647,139,228,10,"Person 1","I agree, but for me it was more about human involvement animals","p035","p030",1.3333,1,3,1.6667
5648,139,228,11,"Person 2","I felt the human involvement part was minimized by the fact that they mentioned people definitely shouldn't stop building garden ponds. I mean, it's hard to believe people are consciously moving amphibians from garden ponds to natural ones, but what do I know.","p035","p030",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
5649,139,228,12,"Person 1","I'm never surprised by what people do anymore. I bet people would read this still move the frogs to a urban pond.","p035","p030",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
5650,139,228,13,"Person 2","You have a point. I wonder if the problem is isolated in the UK or if it is a problem elsewhere too.","p035","p030",1.3333,1,2,1
5651,139,228,14,"Person 1","That is a good question. Hopefully it is isolated to the UK.","p035","p030",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
5652,139,228,15,"Person 2","Do you think there are any practical solutions that weren't mentioned in the article?","p035","p030",1,1,1.6667,1
5653,139,228,16,"Person 1","I can not think of any, what about you?","p035","p030",1,1,1,1
5654,139,228,17,"Person 2","Hm, perhaps if they manufactured a cure for the virus that could be spread in the same way as the virus itself, but that would probably take more time and resources than people were willing to commit.","p035","p030",2,1,2.3333,2
5655,139,228,18,"Person 1","Yeah, most people do not care that much about frogs.","p035","p030",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
5656,139,228,19,"Person 2","Well, thanks for chatting! have a good one! goodbye","p035","p030",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1

5658,139,229,0,"Person 1","Sad story for these frogs :(","p073","p009",2.6667,2,3.6667,1.6667
5659,139,229,1,"Person 2","I agree! i don't like to hear about animals suffering or dying","p073","p009",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
5660,139,229,2,"Person 1","I wonder if the general public has been told anything about what they can do to stop the spread of the disease.","p073","p009",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
5661,139,229,3,"Person 2","I'm not sure but i hope so","p073","p009",2.3333,0,1,1.6667
5662,139,229,4,"Person 1","I would think most people with garden ponds wouldn't want to endanger the frogs if they knew about it","p073","p009",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
5663,139,229,5,"Person 2","I agree. fish too!","p073","p009",2.3333,1,2.6667,2
5664,139,229,6,"Person 1","Yeah, and if it's being spread by whatever they are getting from aquatic stores, the stores should have to test before they sell anything","p073","p009",2,1.3333,3,2
5665,139,229,7,"Person 2","i agree it is not safe for the local community","p073","p009",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
5666,139,229,8,"Person 1","They said that the garden ponds could act like stepping stones, but they aren't discouraging people from having them so I wonder if they think there is a way to stop it.","p073","p009",2.3333,1,3,2
5667,139,229,9,"Person 2","True, I","p073","p009",1,1,2,1
5668,139,229,10,"Person 1","Maybe some type of antivirus to add to their ponds?","p073","p009",1,1,2.6667,1.3333
5669,139,229,11,"Person 2","I was thinking they could spread the cure the same way the disease was spread","p073","p009",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
5670,139,229,12,"Person 1","Yeah, like some type of bait","p073","p009",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
5671,139,229,13,"Person 2","i think that would be a great start","p073","p009",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.6667
5672,139,229,14,"Person 1","Even if there was something for homeowners to do to stop it at their own ponds, then it would be harder for the virus to spread","p073","p009",2,1,2.3333,2
5673,139,229,15,"Person 2","yeah i agree, it would be a community effort","p073","p009",2,0,2.3333,1.6667
5674,139,229,16,"Person 1","I agree, the community would all have to work together!","p073","p009",3,0,2,1.6667
5675,139,229,17,"Person 2","I think it would be well worth it","p073","p009",2.3333,0,2,1.6667
5676,139,229,18,"Person 1","Yes, if it's going to protect the frogs and fish and whatever other wildlife will eventually be affected.","p073","p009",2.3333,0.6667,3.6667,2.3333
5677,139,229,19,"Person 2","which will have a chain reaction","p073","p009",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
5678,139,229,20,"Person 1","Yeah, it's crazy how the loss of one species in an environment can totally throw off the whole ecosystem.","p073","p009",3,1.6667,2.3333,2
5679,139,229,21,"Person 2","I agree! a small problem can turn into a big one quickly","p073","p009",3,1.3333,2.3333,2

5693,139,230,8,"Person 1","It sounds like the governemtn is trying to make people aware, but also that they could be doing more","p019","p068",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
5694,139,230,9,"Person 2","I agree more like on the news or in newspapers radio","p019","p068",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
5695,139,230,10,"Person 1","yes, or even at places that sell ponds, make it madatory that they come with some sort of info panfelt","p019","p068",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
5696,139,230,11,"Person 2","Oh that is a great idea some kind of warning","p019","p068",2.3333,0,1.6667,1.6667
5697,139,230,12,"Person 1","yah that way it will reach everyone who is getting one or updating theirs","p019","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
5698,139,230,13,"Person 2","Very true some sort of law two","p019","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
5699,139,230,14,"Person 1","that would help also","p019","p068",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
5700,139,230,15,"Person 2","poor little guys seems very painful","p019","p068",3,2,3,2
5701,139,230,16,"Person 1","Yes they've got to be suffering","p019","p068",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
5702,139,230,17,"Person 2","wish there was a cure for them","p019","p068",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
5703,139,230,18,"Person 1","I wonder if anyone is working on finding one","p019","p068",2,0.6667,2,1.6667
5704,139,230,19,"Person 2","Maybe the zooligist as frogs are important to the ecosystem","p019","p068",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
5705,139,230,20,"Person 1","that's true, we need them around","p019","p068",1.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
5706,139,230,21,"Person 2","its been great chatting with you!","p019","p068",2.3333,0,0.6667,1.3333
5707,139,230,22,"Person 1","you too! bye","p019","p068",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
5708,139,230,23,"Person 2","bye","p019","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
5709,128,231,0,"Person 1","As a man this makes me sick to see other men behave this way.","p035","p062",4,2,3,3
5710,128,231,1,"Person 2","It's definitely an issue that's existed forever and I wonder whether it can truly change.","p035","p062",2,2,2,2
5711,128,231,2,"Person 1","Your right, I do not think it will change either.","p035","p062",1,2,2,1
5712,128,231,3,"Person 2","I'm afraid that it's also become such a contentious issue that it's hard to even trust allegations anymore when they're in the political sphere.  Which is very sad for people who do experience actual harassment.","p035","p062",3,2,4,1
5713,128,231,4,"Person 1","It is hard but when you hear somebody say grab them by the P, it is not hard to see that person actually doing that.","p035","p062",3,2,2,1
5714,128,231,5,"Person 2","Sure, although the person you're referring to also makes a lot of boasts and claims that are not true, so who's to say that wasn't just him bragging.  I'm just saying that every time there's a false allegation, and there are, it undermines the credibility of every single woman who legitimately experiences it.","p035","p062",3,2,4,1
5715,128,231,6,"Person 1","I agree that some woman make false allegations, but I do not think it is the majority.","p035","p062",2,0,2,1
5716,128,231,7,"Person 2","I agree, I think most allegations have some truth.  But I also think we've gotten hysterical about this stuff, so when someone says, \"I was sexually harassed,\" or even \"assaulted,\" I don't know what that means.  I think that's unfortunate too.","p035","p062",2,2,3,1
5717,128,231,8,"Person 1","It is the climate we live in today. Some of the claims you say, wait a minute that does not sound right, but we should still listen.","p035","p062",2,2,2,1
5718,128,231,9,"Person 2","The other thing about these issues is that we just seem to cycle through them and then lose interest and go onto something else.  Sexual harassment, blacks getting shot by cops, mass shooting, something Trump has done, North Korea or Russia or China, and then back to someone being sexually harassed.  It's just weird how quickly these issues come and go and then come back again, seemingly with no progress, just more ire.","p035","p062",3,2,3,1
5719,128,231,10,"Person 1","Yeah all of these issues need to be addressed in the proper manner. The world is so fast paced that most people do not have time to worry about issues that do not effect them.","p035","p062",3,2,4,1
5720,128,231,11,"Person 2","I think we were all a lot happier when we were less \"informed.\"  Connection and information are a double-edged sword, if nothing else.","p035","p062",2,2,4,1
5721,128,231,12,"Person 1","We would be happier, but some people would be suffering in the dark.","p035","p062",2,2,5,1
5722,128,231,13,"Person 2","Sure.  But are they being helped now?  I guess that's the question.  All of our consternation and anger--is it genuinely improving people's lives?  That's a complicated question, of course.  And certainly some people's are.  I just wonder what the net effect is.","p035","p062",3,2,3,1
5723,128,231,14,"Person 1","I think bringing these issues to the light are helping some people. I think it is better than not thinking about them or hiding them.","p035","p062",2,2,5,1
5724,128,231,15,"Person 2","Certainly could be.  Do you think the net effect of the metoo stuff (apropos this article) has been positive?","p035","p062",3,2,3,1
5725,128,231,16,"Person 1","Yes, because more men are thinking about their behavior.","p035","p062",2,0,4,1
5726,128,231,17,"Person 2","That's probably true.  Do you think there are any downsides?","p035","p062",2,1,1,1
5727,128,231,18,"Person 1","Yes, some women are over reacting and some are flat out lying. What do you think?","p035","p062",3,2,2,3
5728,128,231,19,"Person 2","I think it's a mixed bag.  I think the goal of having women not sexually harassed and assaulted is good and I agree some people are probably thinking about their behavior or even changing it now.  But I think the general relationship between men and women is strained and growing contentious.  I'm not sure how to address some of these issues without that happening, unfortunately.  But I think that, at times, there is a definite \"men versus women\" mentality growing in the country and world, and, at least in the short term, it's harmful in ways.  Is the end result worth it?  Maybe. But it's still an issue, I think.","p035","p062",3,2,3,4
5729,128,231,20,"Person 1","I think there is a small group of women who think it is us vs them. I have three daughters, a mother, female coworkers and friends. I can empathize with them without thinking that I'm being judged as a man","p035","p062",2,1,2,4
5730,128,231,21,"Person 2","That's good.  That's a start.","p035","p062",2,0,2,1
5731,128,231,22,"Person 1","Men should not take this personal unless they know they are guilty of that type of behavior","p035","p062",2,0,3,2
5732,128,231,23,"Person 2","That's true.","p035","p062",1,1,1,1
5733,128,231,24,"Person 1","has anybody you know been a part of the me too movement?","p035","p062",1,1,1,1
5734,128,231,25,"Person 2","Not that I'm aware of.  But I don't have social media accounts, which is where I'm most likely to see that type of thing.","p035","p062",2,1,1,2
5735,128,231,26,"Person 1","I'm glad the movement has given women the courage to speak out.","p035","p062",3,0,3,2
5736,128,231,27,"Person 2","Do you know anyone who's been part of it?","p035","p062",1,1,1,1
5737,128,231,28,"Person 1","Yes, one of my sisters was date raped at a party while she was in college and she is just know talking about it. I always wonder why women wait to say something, but I have never been in their shoes.","p035","p062",2,2,2,4
5738,128,231,29,"Person 2","I'm not surprised they don't report it.  I'm sure there's a lot of fear and shame involved.  I do think it's an impediment to this issue being handled properly though.  If men are going to be held accountable, accusations can't come 30 years later.","p035","p062",2,2,2,3
5739,128,231,30,"Person 1","I agree with you.","p035","p062",1,1,1,2
5740,128,231,31,"Person 2","Any other thoughts on this issue?  I'm mostly tapped out, I think.","p035","p062",1,1,1,1
5741,128,231,32,"Person 1","Me too, no pun intended. Nice chatting with you. bye","p035","p062",1,1,1,1
5742,128,231,33,"Person 2","(Nice one!)  Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p035","p062",2,1,1,1
5743,128,232,0,"Person 1","Well I probably have an unpopular opinion about this but it's how I feel.  I think the #metoo movement has gone too far honestly.  I find a lot of these allegations highly questionable and I'm skeptical.  In this case, her roommates from the time period do recall her mentioning it supposedly so there seems to be some validity there.  But you just never really k now with these things, especially when it's brought up twenty years later.  Seems like a lot of women just do this for attention or whatever weird reasons they might have.","p029","p061",3,1.6667,1,3.3333
5744,128,232,1,"Person 2","In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this.","p029","p061",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
5745,128,232,2,"Person 1","Yeah totally.  It comes down to a \"he says, she says\" in so many cases.  I agree that the fact that she mentioned it at the time lends some credibility to the story.  I just feel like so many men have been unfairly crucified by this whole movement.","p029","p061",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.6667
5746,128,232,3,"Person 2","In some cases maybe. Or maybe more women are just speaking up when they were afraid to before, since it's so hard to prove one way or the other.","p029","p061",2,1.3333,3,2
5747,128,232,4,"Person 1","I would guess a little bit of both, but it could also be that more women are wanting to fabricate things and get int he spotlight bc they see it happening with other women","p029","p061",2.6667,2,1.3333,2.6667
5748,128,232,5,"Person 2","I guess it's hard to imagine anyone would want to be recognized for something like that. I mean you never know, I guess. What do you think a woman should do if she's been a victim but has no proof? It's pretty easy to just grab or touch someone without anyone else seeing","p029","p061",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
5749,128,232,6,"Person 1","I find it very easy to believe someone would want to be recognized for that.  People will do anything for attention.  Look at reality TV and social media.  I think people should report things when they happen, not 20 years later.","p029","p061",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,3
5750,128,232,7,"Person 2","Sure, that would be helpful but even then if you have no proof it doesn't really matter if it just happened does it? It could still be seen as a ploy for attention or an attempt to bring someone down. Or there could be shame involved too. Not everyone is just out to get attention. Some victims are too ashamed to say anything.","p029","p061",3,1.3333,3,2.3333
5751,128,232,8,"Person 1","Yep I agree, but the ones who are fabricating it and doing it for attention are ruining it for the genuine victims","p029","p061",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
5752,128,232,9,"Person 2","I suppose so. But we can't really punish women for coming forward just because they don't have proof.","p029","p061",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
5753,128,232,10,"Person 1","No, you can't punish them, but honestly in my opinion you can't treat a man as though he's guilty unless there is proof.  But unfortunately, once these people make their allegations the public basically treats the person as though they are guilty and their life is destroyed, and often their career and the lives of their family members.  So to me it is just very sad.  And it scares me for my sons.  My husband doesn't even want to be around women at work bc he is scared someone might make up some allegation.  THAT is a hostile environment and unfair to men.","p029","p061",4,1.3333,1.6667,3.6667
5754,128,232,11,"Person 2","That's true, there needs to be proof before punishment. Anyone who is fired for something like that without proof should be able to sue for wrongful termination.","p029","p061",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
5755,128,232,12,"Person 1","Yes they should.  But I do understand what you're saying about the true victims and the predicament they are in.  I Just think it's a very sad situation for everyone and it's distressing that this is an issue in our society now.","p029","p061",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5756,128,232,13,"Person 2","It is definitely a difficult situation.","p029","p061",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
5757,128,232,14,"Person 1","Yes really without any good solution.  People would have to constantly be wearing body cameras to have definitive proof one way or the other, which is absurd.","p029","p061",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
5758,128,232,15,"Person 2","Yep. Or companies would have to start putting cameras up everywhere which is also ridiculous. We just need to teach our children how to handle these situations and hope for the best.","p029","p061",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
5759,128,232,16,"Person 1","Yeah, no doubt.  Maybe the next generation can see some improvement if parents work to teach them better when they are young.  I don't know.","p029","p061",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5760,128,232,17,"Person 2","I hope so.","p029","p061",1.6667,0.3333,1,1.3333
5761,128,232,18,"Person 1","You and me both.  Well thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you have a good day.  goodbye","p029","p061",1.6667,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
5762,128,232,19,"Person 2","You too. bye","p029","p061",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1
5763,128,233,0,"Person 1","Hello! How do you feel about this story?","p073","p063",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
5764,128,233,1,"Person 2","Honestly, I'm sure it sounds insensitive, but I'm tired of these.","p073","p063",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
5765,128,233,2,"Person 1","I agree, who knows if it really happened or if this is just political.","p073","p063",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
5766,128,233,3,"Person 2","Yeah and at this point, particularly after the Smollet, and Kavanaugh case, I just tend to doubt the accuser more.  Especially when the accusations are dated by decades.","p073","p063",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.6667
5767,128,233,4,"Person 1","Exactly, the timing is always very suspicious.","p073","p063",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
5768,128,233,5,"Person 2","I understand it form the other perspective too, maybe the name, such as Kavanaugh, becomes so huge in the news, that it infuriates you and you feel like you have to say something. I still just don't buy it though.","p073","p063",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
5769,128,233,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I can see that too. But it's not like Clarence Thomas just became a big thing recently.","p073","p063",2,1.6667,2,2
5770,128,233,7,"Person 2","Yeah.  A lot of this supreme court stuff, I think the democrats saw the opportunity for the gop to take a massive majority in the court, and decided they had to take drastic efforts to curb that.  They were too eager to push this narrative, even though the evidence wasn't there.","p073","p063",2.3333,1.6667,2,3
5771,128,233,8,"Person 1","I think these things must really bother people who have been actually attacked / raped... She says he cupped his hand over her butt. If that happened to me, I would probably forget about it by the next day.","p073","p063",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5772,128,233,9,"Person 2","Seriously.  Ok, this might be a little off the wall, but I think this is the human evolution catching up to society.  It used to be that man protected and hunted, women took care of kids, and were prized for their looks and maternal instincts.  Nowadays, woman have caught up to men in their working ability.  Men have to learn that women aren't their property anymore, and this is a dynamic that might take time to set in with the elitely wealthy.","p073","p063",3,2,2.3333,3.3333
5773,128,233,10,"Person 1","If women and men are completely equal. I think men wouldn't really think twice about a women touching their butt. And I don't think 20 that they would be going public about it 20 years later.","p073","p063",2.3333,1.6667,2,3
5774,128,233,11,"Person 2","Lol.  Every man's wildest fantasy includes a woman touching his butt unanounced.  But no, I don't think men and women are necessariliy equal in abilities and talents, I'm not one of those people.","p073","p063",3.3333,1,2.3333,3.3333
5775,128,233,12,"Person 1","Too funny! If he did intentionally cup his hand over her butt 20 years ago, would there be anything legally to do about it anyway?","p073","p063",3.3333,1,1.6667,2
5776,128,233,13,"Person 2","I would assume only in the court of public opinion.  There would be a push to take away his seat.  Which is just another reason to think this was politially motivated.","p073","p063",3,1.6667,2,2.3333
5777,128,233,14,"Person 1","The world is a scary place. I feel for my kids having to grow up in this environment.","p073","p063",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
5778,128,233,15,"Person 2","Yeah I think the same thing sometime.  However, when you really think about it, the world could go completely south in the next few years, and still be leaps and bounds better than it was 200/500/1000 years ago.","p073","p063",3,0.6667,1.3333,2
5779,128,233,16,"Person 1","That's a good way to look at it!","p073","p063",3.3333,0,1,1.3333
5780,128,233,17,"Person 2","Lol, I do however doubt humanity is going to be around for another thousand years.  I'm sure that we're going to find some way to eff things up in the next century or two.","p073","p063",3.3333,1.6667,1,2.3333
5781,128,233,18,"Person 1","I think about that all of the time. When you do look at how much it's changed from even just 200 years ago. I wonder how long it can keep going.","p073","p063",3,2,1,2
5782,128,233,19,"Person 2","yeah, I remember hearing couple years ago about how we've basically reached the limit that we can on processor speed or storage or something like that.  I wonder when that kind of thing will start to hit our other technologies.","p073","p063",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5783,128,233,20,"Person 1","Yeah, who knows. I can't imagine the future progressing as quickly as it has over the past 100 years.","p073","p063",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
5784,128,233,21,"Person 2","Yeah it's like we had the industrial revolution, and maybe now we're nearing the end of the technological revolution.  But who knows...","p073","p063",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
5785,128,233,22,"Person 1","Great conversation! Went from butt touching to the end of technological revolution! Nice talking to you!","p073","p063",3,0,1.3333,1.3333
5786,128,233,23,"Person 2","lol yeah good talk. bye","p073","p063",2,0,1,1
5787,128,233,24,"Person 1","bye","p073","p063",1,1,0.6667,1
5788,128,234,0,"Person 1","What did you think about this?","p029","p019",1,1,0.6667,1
5789,128,234,1,"Person 2","I think that it's sad she was questioned and doubted what seems like right off the bat","p029","p019",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
5790,128,234,2,"Person 1","You think they should have just automatically believed her?","p029","p019",1.3333,1,1,1
5791,128,234,3,"Person 2","pretty much yah... innocent until proven guilty, just flipped right","p029","p019",2,1.5,1.6667,2
5792,128,234,4,"Person 1","I disagree, what if they assumed all allegations against men were true?","p029","p019",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
5793,128,234,5,"Person 2","You have to assume that first yes. and then investigate and go from there. If you doubt initiallly what does that do to the victim if it is legit","p029","p019",1.6667,1.5,1.6667,2.3333
5794,128,234,6,"Person 1","I think you have to be neutral until you gather facts.  if you assume guilt, what does that do to the accused if later it is found they were innocent??","p029","p019",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
5795,128,234,7,"Person 2","same visa versa though, what does it do to the victim? I think what you're saying about remaining neutral is smart... But you have to think like, you call the cops and tell them your house got robbed, and they start off with doubt. Their not gonna pour all the effort they could into solving this for you.The doubt needs to be based on facts just like the belief","p029","p019",2,1,2,3
5796,128,234,8,"Person 1","that analogy is not the same bc it is not potentially ruining someone's life and reputation, but anyhow I don't want to have a debate bc we clearly disagree and I am not going to change my mind.  as far as the article, it did seem he is probably guilty in this case.  I feel bad for the woman","p029","p019",2.6667,1.5,3.3333,2.6667
5797,128,234,9,"Person 2","agreed, I think he's guilty too. I feel bad for her... lifelong thing to deal with","p029","p019",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
5798,128,234,10,"Person 1","yep and she had to sit on it for so long","p029","p019",2,2,3,1.6667
5799,128,234,11,"Person 2","i wonder why she did that","p029","p019",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
5800,128,234,12,"Person 1","I wondered the same.  maybe she was scared bc he was powerful?  or didn't want to mess up her career? what do you think","p029","p019",2,1,3.3333,2.3333
5801,128,234,13,"Person 2","Those are both valid points, could have been both. I'd probably feel/act the same way I think","p029","p019",2,1,2.6667,2.3333
5802,128,234,14,"Person 1","yeah it would definitely be an uncomfortable position to be in for sure, it's good she finally came forward","p029","p019",2.3333,0,3,2
5803,128,234,15,"Person 2","Agreed, that guy needed to be stopped from being able to do this again. Very strong of her to do!","p029","p019",2.3333,0,3,2
5804,128,234,16,"Person 1","yes! he was clearly abusing his power in a grotesque way","p029","p019",3,1.5,3.3333,2.3333
5805,128,234,17,"Person 2","for sure... People can be awful.","p029","p019",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
5806,128,234,18,"Person 1","they really can.  it is so disgusting and sad.  well i hope you have a good day, I gotta go.  bye!","p029","p019",2.6667,1.5,2.3333,2
5807,128,234,19,"Person 2","you too! bye","p029","p019",1.3333,0.5,0.6667,1
5808,128,235,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p024","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
5809,128,235,1,"Person 2","I feel so bad for women going through this","p024","p068",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
5810,128,235,2,"Person 1","do you think it really happened or do you think she might be lying","p024","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.3333
5811,128,235,3,"Person 2","I think we should never question assault it sets a bad thing moving forward","p024","p068",3.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
5812,128,235,4,"Person 1","thats true i sort of believe her because she was young when it happened","p024","p068",2,1,2,2.3333
5813,128,235,5,"Person 2","True and another woman came forward as well","p024","p068",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
5814,128,235,6,"Person 1","yeah it makes sense that its true and not a lie given that fact","p024","p068",2,1,2,2.3333
5815,128,235,7,"Person 2","men in power doing this are more and more its crazy","p024","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
5816,128,235,8,"Person 1","yeah they feel like since they have some power they can get women to do whatever they want","p024","p068",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
5817,128,235,9,"Person 2","it is so gross how do they think its okay","p024","p068",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
5818,128,235,10,"Person 1","yeah i wonder why they feel that way","p024","p068",2,1,1.6667,1
5819,128,235,11,"Person 2","more needs to be done","p024","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5820,128,235,12,"Person 1","what do you think can be done","p024","p068",1.6667,1,0.6667,1
5821,128,235,13,"Person 2","more education in school i think on harrasment","p024","p068",2,1,2,2.3333
5822,128,235,14,"Person 1","yeah and at home from the parents","p024","p068",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
5823,128,235,15,"Person 2","true more values and morals especially for young men","p024","p068",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.6667
5824,128,235,16,"Person 1","yeah that would help a lot","p024","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1,1.6667
5825,128,235,17,"Person 2","Also, more ways for women to feel safe coming forward against them","p024","p068",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
5826,128,235,18,"Person 1","do you know anyone that has gone through what that woman went through","p024","p068",2,1,1.3333,1
5827,128,235,19,"Person 2","A couple girls from college it happens there alot and swept under the rug","p024","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
5828,128,235,20,"Person 1","yeah i hear that stuff happens a ton in college","p024","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
5829,128,235,21,"Person 2","it was great talking to you today!","p024","p068",2,0,0.6667,1
5830,128,235,22,"Person 1","bye","p024","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
5831,128,235,23,"Person 2","bye","p024","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
5832,245,236,0,"Person 1","I'm glad the lady was found otherwise she might have been in serious trouble out in the cold.","p062","p033",2.6667,0,3.6667,2.6667
5833,245,236,1,"Person 2","that's right. Also they did the right thing to send her for medical checkup","p062","p033",2,0,3.3333,2.3333
5834,245,236,2,"Person 1","Yes.  I assume she is mentally ill or has dementia, or was maybe just under the influence of something.  Her family must have been very worried.","p062","p033",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
5835,245,236,3,"Person 2","Can't imagine what would they be going through if she was indeed sick with dementia or something","p062","p033",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
5836,245,236,4,"Person 1","I wonder if this kind of thing is happening more often now.  People are living longer and maybe more people are forced to take care of elderly or sick relatives at home.","p062","p033",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
5837,245,236,5,"Person 2","People are definitely living longer and though we are getting better physical treatments but brain seems to age at its separate pace","p062","p033",2,1,2,2
5838,245,236,6,"Person 1","Yes, it's definitely a problem.  I see on TV some ad saying that \"the first survivor of Alzheimer's is alive today,\" or something like that.  So maybe cures for some of these brain diseases are around the corner.","p062","p033",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
5839,245,236,7,"Person 2","I hope so, when I think about the old age this is the thing I most fear about. Losing memories of all your life slowly but progressively would really be terrorizing","p062","p033",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
5840,245,236,8,"Person 1","Yeah, I think so too.  I'd rather meet a swift end than have my brain deteriorate.  My grandfather had Alzheimer's.  It's hard on everyone.","p062","p033",4,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5841,245,236,9,"Person 2","It must really be a tough time, my grandmother too had dementia but this is something that is really hard to live through I guess. Hard for someone to imagine the pain as it is not a physical one","p062","p033",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
5842,245,236,10,"Person 1","Yeah, it's definitely hard to relate.  I imagine they experience a lot of confusion and fear associated with not knowing what's going on.","p062","p033",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
5843,245,236,11,"Person 2","True, Just couple of days ago I learned that Alzheimer patients may die due to suffocation as their brain my forget how to breathe. Don't know how true that is but that is one scary state","p062","p033",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5844,245,236,12,"Person 1","Wow, that's a wild thought.  I can't even imagine what that would be like.  I also don't envy all the people who work in facilities to take care of dementia patients.  Those people are saints.","p062","p033",3,2,2,2.3333
5845,245,236,13,"Person 2","Exactly, I was thinking about that some time ago, it's like children but when we deal with children we do so with hope that they will learn and growup but there is no hope for those old patients","p062","p033",3.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
5846,245,236,14,"Person 1","I think there's probably already a shortage of these types of workers, and it will only get worse going forward.  Old folks homes and that type of thing are a massive industry now.  We used to just put our elderly in the attic.","p062","p033",2.3333,1.6667,2,3
5847,245,236,15,"Person 2","It's definitely going to be a bigger problem as people live longer and longer.","p062","p033",2,2,1.6667,2
5848,245,236,16,"Person 1","Back to this story, it's still nice to see that there's help out there in various forms.  Police get a bad rap these days but they still do plenty to help people.  And we focus on negative events and people, but there's still no shortage of people willing to help others.  We still have \"communities\" whether we recognize it often or not.","p062","p033",2.6667,0,2,2.3333
5849,245,236,17,"Person 2","Police really have a difficult job, you can do 1000's of such acts in your career but what will be remembered is one less than perfect act. I just hope that the lady in this story gets the help she obviously needs after her rescue","p062","p033",2.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.3333
5850,245,236,18,"Person 1","Yes, for sure.  And I'm sure in the short term she's well taken care of.  But the family (assuming she lives with her family) will likely struggle with her for many more years, unfortunately.","p062","p033",3,1,2.6667,2.3333
5851,245,236,19,"Person 2","Right, I wonder if the govt should get involved in these scenarios somehow. But then what really can they do to provide ease such families","p062","p033",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
5852,245,236,20,"Person 1","Yes, I think it's complicated, and not least of all costly.  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye","p062","p033",1.6667,1,1,1.6667
5853,245,236,21,"Person 2","Hopefully you will have a nice one too. goodbye","p062","p033",1.6667,0.3333,1,1
5854,245,237,0,"Person 1","Have you had any first hand experience with alzheimers or dementia?","p030","p035",1,1,2,1
5855,245,237,1,"Person 2","Yes, , my grandmother and you?","p030","p035",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
5856,245,237,2,"Person 1","My great grandfather. It's really sad to think that the police had to reach out to the community to find out where this person belonged. She must have lived alone.. or in a poorly tended elderly community.","p030","p035",3,2,3,3
5857,245,237,3,"Person 2","Yeah. It is scary thinking that can happen to any of us when with get older.","p030","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
5858,245,237,4,"Person 1","We all eventually become children a second time, it's true.","p030","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
5859,245,237,5,"Person 2","It hurt me to see my grandmother lose her Independence","p030","p035",3.3333,2,3,3
5860,245,237,6,"Person 1","That's the most unnerving part about it, how much it hurts your family to see you in such a place.","p030","p035",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
5861,245,237,7,"Person 2","I kept my grandmother at home until she died, most people wanted me to put her in a nursing home but I could not do it.","p030","p035",3,1.3333,3,3.6667
5862,245,237,8,"Person 1","That's what my grandfather did with his parents. I honestly don't think I could handle having to carry my mother to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Good on you.","p030","p035",3.6667,1,2.3333,3.3333
5863,245,237,9,"Person 2","I think you could do it. It is not easy, but it was a honor for me to be able to take care of my grandmother since she did so much for me in my life.","p030","p035",3.6667,0,2.6667,3
5864,245,237,10,"Person 1","Yeah, as difficult as it sounds, the thought of her sitting alone and confused in some nursing home would be even more psychologically damaging.","p030","p035",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
5865,245,237,11,"Person 2","I understand that some people because of work or other reasons can not do it.","p030","p035",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
5866,245,237,12,"Person 1","Well, and so people don't get along so swimmingly with their familial relations.","p030","p035",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
5867,245,237,13,"Person 2","That is true, but the ones that you do get along with, hold them close because we all are on a limited timer.","p030","p035",3.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
5868,245,237,14,"Person 1","Indeed, my uncle died unexpectedly a few years ago and now my grandparents insist that the family gets together at least once a week.","p030","p035",3,1,2.6667,3
5869,245,237,15,"Person 2","sorry to hear about your uncle. getting together,that would depend on how close with live:)","p030","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5870,245,237,16,"Person 1","One of my brothers and I live in different parts of the country, but the rest of the family participates. My grandmother sends me text messages every day. It's nice.","p030","p035",2.6667,0,2,3
5871,245,237,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I try to stay in touch with my mother, both set of grandparents have passed, my father passed, and My oldest brother died last year at age of 41.","p030","p035",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,4
5872,245,237,18,"Person 1","My condolences for your losses. I hope you treasured your time with all of them. I'm sure they treasured their time with you. Thanks for chatting with me today. goodbye","p030","p035",3.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
5873,245,237,19,"Person 2","nice chatting with you too. bye","p030","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1,1
5874,245,238,0,"Person 1","Well I thought this was a little sad.  Like, weren't the family even looking for this person?","p029","p073",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
5875,245,238,1,"Person 2","I was thinking about that, but if she still lives by herself, they might not have realized that she was gone yet.","p029","p073",1.3333,1.3333,3,2
5876,245,238,2,"Person 1","yeah I considered that, too.  Did the article mention how long it's been","p029","p073",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
5877,245,238,3,"Person 2","I don't recall an exact time but it seemed that it was recent that she had been found.","p029","p073",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
5878,245,238,4,"Person 1","yeah so maybe the family will realize soon and come locate her.  I hope.","p029","p073",2.3333,0,3,2.3333
5879,245,238,5,"Person 2","Yeah, Alzheimer's runs badly in my dad's family and he is starting to show signs of it. I worry about something like this happening all of the time.","p029","p073",3,1.6667,2,3.6667
5880,245,238,6,"Person 1","I am sorry to hear that, I know it can be very difficult for family members.","p029","p073",2.3333,2,2,2
5881,245,238,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it's almost more the family than the person with the disease. I read a story once similar to this and when the family picked up the lady, she was like, \"Hey, where are we going now.\" She didn't even realize what had just happened.","p029","p073",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
5882,245,238,8,"Person 1","That is what I have heard about the family.  That's so sad.  My husband's grandmother had alzheimers and passed away last year.  It was very hard on their family too.","p029","p073",2.6667,2,3,3
5883,245,238,9,"Person 2","So sorry. I keep hearing that they are so close to a cure. I hope so!","p029","p073",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5884,245,238,10,"Person 1","Oh yeah, that would be amazing.  It would really impact a lot of families for sure","p029","p073",2.3333,0.6667,3,2
5885,245,238,11,"Person 2","I just remembered the story said she was wearing scrub pants. That sounds like she was in a facility. If so, that is horrible if they haven't realized that she is missing.","p029","p073",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
5886,245,238,12,"Person 1","Oh true, I did not notice that.  That is horrible.  I'm always reading stories of abuse and negligence in these facilities.  That's unforgivable.","p029","p073",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
5887,245,238,13,"Person 2","I wonder if they noticed she was missing but didn't want to tell the police.","p029","p073",2,1.3333,3,2
5888,245,238,14,"Person 1","I would say that's definitely possible.  how sad","p029","p073",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
5889,245,238,15,"Person 2","That would be sad. I've seen too many stories of facilities covering things up to save their reputation. Maybe they thought she would wander and then eventually return.","p029","p073",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
5890,245,238,16,"Person 1","YEah I have seen those stories too!  Preying on a highly vulnerable population","p029","p073",2.6667,2,2,2
5891,245,238,17,"Person 2","It is so sad, I'm sure it would be hard enough just to make the decision to put someone in a facility, and then to have to deal with this kind of thing.","p029","p073",3.6667,2,3.3333,2
5892,245,238,18,"Person 1","Yes, for sure.  It would just add to the feelings of guilt.  Well thank you for sharing your feelings with me, have a great day!  goodbye","p029","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
5893,245,238,19,"Person 2","bye","p029","p073",1,1,1,1
5894,245,239,0,"Person 1","i wonder what was wrong with that woman","p024","p063",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
5895,245,239,1,"Person 2","yeah sounds like she had some serious medical problems.  wouldn't be this much hubbub if it was just a drunk person.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5896,245,239,2,"Person 1","yeah its obvious she has mental problems","p024","p063",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
5897,245,239,3,"Person 2","I saw that she was almost seventy.  In my line of work, you see a lot dementia or alzheimers patients tht get out of their house and wander.","p024","p063",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
5898,245,239,4,"Person 1","yeah it happens to some people at that age which begs the question who was taking care of her","p024","p063",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5899,245,239,5,"Person 2","Yeah, it's hard to blame the caretaker though.  There's a lot of people out there who are afraid of homes, and think they can take care of their spouse in their later years.  Gets difficult, and next thing you know George snuck his way out of the house while you were taking a shower.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
5900,245,239,6,"Person 1","Surely someone will step up","p024","p063",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
5901,245,239,7,"Person 2","There's a lot of people without family out there, and even then, caring for a mentally ill older patient can be incredibly difficult and time consuming.","p024","p063",2,2,2,2.3333
5902,245,239,8,"Person 1","if that was my parent none of that would matter tbh. id care for them.","p024","p063",3,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
5903,245,239,9,"Person 2","If you have a job, that becomes impossible.  If you don't have a job, how do you make money?","p024","p063",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5904,245,239,10,"Person 1","theres people you can pay to look after them while working. caring for someone does not mean you are with them 24/7 lol","p024","p063",2.6667,1,2,1.6667
5905,245,239,11,"Person 2","Lol do you have any experience with this? Do you have any idea how expensive home health care nurses are?  Most people cannot afford those services, and even if you can, most home health care only show up for an hour a day.  To pay for help to watch your parent full time, while you work full time, would be pointless.","p024","p063",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
5906,245,239,12,"Person 1","well I guess thats a price I'm willing to pay for my parents who took care of my annoying self as a child even though I was not always nice to them. There is more than just health care nurses out there lol.","p024","p063",3,0.6667,2,2.3333
5907,245,239,13,"Person 2","Look, this isn't even about caring for a parent, this is about caring for a parent, who also wants to wake up at 2 am, and head to the grocery store that doens't exist.  I'm aware that you think you've got it all figured out, but I can assure you, life with a spouse who has dementia is tougher than you think.","p024","p063",4,1.6667,3,2.6667
5908,245,239,14,"Person 1","trust me I'm currently caring for kids that were taken from my sister because of her mental problems. I am now taking care of them as seen by the state. I am not with them 24/7 and I find ways to look after them and make sure their homework is done on time. Even the bad child who was out until 4 am when he was under my sisters care doesn't sneak out now. I am not new to caring for people. Someone with dementia is a whole other ballgame. No one has it all figured out, its just that caring for loved ones is not that difficult. Maybe we were raised differently.","p024","p063",4.3333,1,2.3333,3.3333
5909,245,239,15,"Person 2","I'm not saying that you can't care for people, I just think blaming the caretakers for a sick old person getting out is kind of jumping the gun.","p024","p063",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
5910,245,239,16,"Person 1","if you know someone you are looking after has dementia you raise you level of care. You install alarm systems, phone apps etc. The technology is there. Ofc it wont work all the time and I am not trying to discredit your points because they are valid. But you just have to step your game up according to the circumstances","p024","p063",2.6667,1,2.6667,2
5911,245,239,17,"Person 2","Well I agree with that.","p024","p063",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
5912,245,239,18,"Person 1","I agree with many of your points as well its just if there is a will theres a way","p024","p063",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
5913,245,239,19,"Person 2","True, just remember it isn't the will of a thirty year old we're talking about here a lot, it's a seventy something year old spouse who doesn't want to stop caring for their loved one.  But I hear ya.","p024","p063",3,1.3333,2,2
5914,245,239,20,"Person 1","yeah most definitely my parents are up there in age thank god they are still with me mentally.","p024","p063",2.3333,0,2.6667,2.3333
5915,245,239,21,"Person 2","That's definitely got to be one of those diseases that really affects the kids and spouses more than the patient themselves.  I couldn't imagine my wife or parents forgetting who I was, or the memories we shared.","p024","p063",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
5916,245,239,22,"Person 1","Thats a scary thought bro. We have to be thankful everyday no one close to us has that disease and hope it stays that way.","p024","p063",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
5917,245,239,23,"Person 2","I always love reading the news that they're close to finding a cure for alzheimers.  Hope that that'll never be something I deal with.","p024","p063",2.6667,0,2.6667,3
5918,245,239,24,"Person 1","yeah we always read about these cures but to be honest they still seem far away","p024","p063",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5919,245,239,25,"Person 2","True. I'm sure a lot of them are just clickbait.","p024","p063",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
5920,245,239,26,"Person 1","Yeah these sites that clickbait these cures need to be removed. I can't imagine getting my hopes up if my wife had dementia only to click on it and see it was nothing. Thats playing with peoples emotions a little too much. Anyway, this has been the best talk I've had on one of these hits brother. I respect you very much for that. Hope the rest of your day goes well. bye","p024","p063",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667

5922,245,240,0,"Person 1","What did you think of it?","p029","p068",1,1,1,1
5923,245,240,1,"Person 2","You just feel for older people so sad","p029","p068",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
5924,245,240,2,"Person 1","yeah exactly how it made me feel!  it is sad to see such decline","p029","p068",3,2,3,2
5925,245,240,3,"Person 2","I think this type of thing is happening more and more these days","p029","p068",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
5926,245,240,4,"Person 1","yeah I have noticed that to, why do you think that is?","p029","p068",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
5927,245,240,5,"Person 2","I am not sure maybe something about how that generation lived","p029","p068",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
5928,245,240,6,"Person 1","maybe so, or maybe just a breakdown of family, I really don't know.   probably a combination of many factors.  people are too busy to deal with it.","p029","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
5929,245,240,7,"Person 2","I agree Dr oz his mother just got althiemers he said many families just dont want to face reality","p029","p068",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
5930,245,240,8,"Person 1","yeah that's a good point, too.  It's a lot to swallow.  my grandfather is 98 and needs constant care, it's really hard on my mom","p029","p068",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
5931,245,240,9,"Person 2","aw i am so sorry i could not imagine mentally and emotionally so sad","p029","p068",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
5932,245,240,10,"Person 1","yeah it is pretty sad, his wife died two years ago, they had been married since they were 18 and sweethearts since age 14 or so.  really sad.","p029","p068",4,2,3.3333,3.3333
5933,245,240,11,"Person 2","oh i could not imagine how heartbreaking that is seems like theyve been able to live a very long life good for them","p029","p068",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
5934,245,240,12,"Person 1","yeah I guess so.  I think it gets rough at a certian point, like are people even meant to live that long?","p029","p068",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5935,245,240,13,"Person 2","I agree I dont think I would want to","p029","p068",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333

5938,245,240,16,"Person 1","yeah I agree, it seems people get so miserable","p029","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
5939,245,240,17,"Person 2","miserable and then just lose there minds not a great quality of life","p029","p068",3,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
5940,245,240,18,"Person 1","No, it is not at all.  well I must go, nice talking to you.  bye!","p029","p068",2,0.3333,1,1
5941,245,240,19,"Person 2","you two thank you bye","p029","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1,1
5942,19,241,0,"Person 1","Hi did you read about the artical on smugglers?","p003","p030",1.3333,1,1,1
5943,19,241,1,"Person 2","Smugglers and refugees, yes. You?","p003","p030",1.6667,1,1,1.6667
5944,19,241,2,"Person 1","Yes indeed, It was aufull to read to know so many are affected. what did you think of it?","p003","p030",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
5945,19,241,3,"Person 2","I think that even though the article was from 2016 it is still very relevant. I also thought it quite morbid that no accounts of rescue were mentioned. These people are drowning along well trafficked routes through the Mediterranean and no one can be bothered to help? At all?","p003","p030",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
5946,19,241,4,"Person 1","I agree, what I found was really terrible was that thousands of people drowned in the Medaterain, and goverments arnt doing anything to stop that from happening","p003","p030",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
5947,19,241,5,"Person 2","I wonder how many of the one million refugees Merkel promised to harbor actually made it to Germany.","p003","p030",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5948,19,241,6,"Person 1","That a good question. This article was a little hard to take it all in, I wish they would of made it a bit more readable because there was so MUCH important information concerning so many countries in the word.","p003","p030",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
5949,19,241,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it was a little discursive. One minute were talking about smugglers, then were on to drownings and finally some war reporting. It would have scanned better emotionally with better focus.","p003","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
5950,19,241,8,"Person 1","Indeed, Perhaps they can segment it better so they can make three articles out of this focusing on different countries concerning smugglers, that would certainly help... again there was SO much information it was hard to tak in all of it..","p003","p030",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
5951,19,241,9,"Person 2","Also, smugglers barely got a mention in passing. What kind of smugglers were they? Where are they from? That was a lead to nowhere.","p003","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
5952,19,241,10,"Person 1","Yes and they mention that goverments are just turning a blind eye -- does that mean all countries? they're just not really clear.","p003","p030",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
5953,19,241,11,"Person 2","Now am wondering which journalist, and more importantly, which journal of opinion, would run such a slap dash article.","p003","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
5954,19,241,12,"Person 1","I'm not sure, but I remember that this was an article from CNN, or so it stated as a resource at the very beginning -- CNN is ver impartial though, and a lot of what was in it seemed a bit emotional, and not detached factual, I hope that sounded right! :)","p003","p030",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
5955,19,241,13,"Person 2","Wow, you really paid your dues in attention. I don't watch/read much CNN. You have any ideas on how to deal with integration of all these refugees into western society?","p003","p030",2,1,2,2.3333
5956,19,241,14,"Person 1","Thank you! CNN was in parenthesizes before the first sentence. I wish I had a solution, but I think that if more goverments got involved in the countries it was effecting, perhaps it would help. Maybe pursuing the matter more through the UN.","p003","p030",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
5957,19,241,15,"Person 2","I wonder about the UN's effectiveness sometimes. I'd like to see some numbers on how these people are being settled.","p003","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
5958,19,241,16,"Person 1","That is a very interesting point. I know that the UN typicly will get involved, but it is a process...and the effectiveness it has usually relies on the international help of other countries involvements.","p003","p030",2.6667,1,2,2
5959,19,241,17,"Person 2","Not just international help, but international agreement on the correct course of action, the place has to be a hornets nest.","p003","p030",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
5960,19,241,18,"Person 1","I wish there was a good way to solve these issues. I'm not the best when it comes to issues, I try to keep up with news, but these poor people that are just trying to get away from war in their county, and theirs little to no help.","p003","p030",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
5961,19,241,19,"Person 2","Right, it's not like anyone wants to leave their home. They are forced from the houses of their father's and then drown in the ocean alone and afraid. Jeez.. thanks for chatting, bye","p003","p030",3,2,3,2.6667
5962,19,241,20,"Person 1","bye!","p003","p030",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
5963,19,242,0,"Person 1","That was a sad article","p024","p035",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
5964,19,242,1,"Person 2","I agree, what do you think can be done to help?","p024","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
5965,19,242,2,"Person 1","We can probably help better those countries","p024","p035",1.3333,1,2,2
5966,19,242,3,"Person 2","I agree. It makes me think how good we have it.","p024","p035",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,2.6667
5967,19,242,4,"Person 1","Yeah what do you think should be done","p024","p035",1,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
5968,19,242,5,"Person 2","Allow more people in and help the countries better themselves for people do not have to leave.","p024","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
5969,19,242,6,"Person 1","i think thats a good idea","p024","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2,2.3333
5970,19,242,7,"Person 2","I think people in this world need my empathy for others. Nobody risks their life on a cheap boat because they want to steal from your country or take what you have. They just want a better life.","p024","p035",2.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
5971,19,242,8,"Person 1","I think we need to just let some in not all because most countries cant handle all of that to be honest","p024","p035",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
5972,19,242,9,"Person 2","I agree, the main focus should be country improvements.","p024","p035",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
5973,19,242,10,"Person 1","also hold those accountable that are doing harm to those countries","p024","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2,3
5974,19,242,11,"Person 2","I hate to say it but we are part of the problem.","p024","p035",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
5975,19,242,12,"Person 1","yes true but what i mean by that is the dictators","p024","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
5976,19,242,13,"Person 2","We took out Liyba's dictator and leave them without a government.","p024","p035",1.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
5977,19,242,14,"Person 1","that was a mess that guy was doing good things for that country","p024","p035",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
5978,19,242,15,"Person 2","now they say it is a waste land. I know these problems do not have simple answers, but they do have answers.","p024","p035",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
5979,19,242,16,"Person 1","its a slippery slope","p024","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
5980,19,242,17,"Person 2","I would hate to be on a nice modern ship in the ocean. It would be hard for me to get on a cheap boat with 300 people hanging on, but I guess I would not have a choice.","p024","p035",2.6667,1.6667,3,3
5981,19,242,18,"Person 1","yeah when your kids are at risk you do anything to save them","p024","p035",2,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
5982,19,242,19,"Person 2","sadly a lot kids die on those boats too.","p024","p035",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
5983,19,242,20,"Person 1","its either die on a boat or die in your homeland. its a pick your poison type of situation","p024","p035",2.3333,2,3.6667,2
5984,19,242,21,"Person 2","Do you have any other thoughts about the article?","p024","p035",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
5985,19,242,22,"Person 1","just hope for the best for them. it was a good talk. bye","p024","p035",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2
5986,19,242,23,"Person 2","you too bye","p024","p035",1,1,0.3333,1
5987,19,243,0,"Person 1","That's a heckuva lot of refugees heading towards Europe!","p062","p029",3,1,1.3333,2
5988,19,243,1,"Person 2","Yeah I found the numbers staggering too.  Plus the death toll were shockingly high.","p062","p029",3,2,2,2
5989,19,243,2,"Person 1","I was curious how the deal with Turkey has decreased numbers in that path to Europe.  I wonder how Turkey is slowing/stopping the migration.","p062","p029",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
5990,19,243,3,"Person 2","I don't know anything about the deal with Turkey, fill me in?","p062","p029",1.6667,1,1,2
5991,19,243,4,"Person 1","The article described the three paths the migrants are using to get to Europe.  Basically Western Africa, which isn't a lot, Libya/Central Africa, and then through Turkey.  But it said that a deal had been made between Greece and Turkey (I think), to limit that number, suggesting Turkey was keeping migrants from moving through their country and into Greece/Europe.  Sort of like the US is asking Mexico to prevent migrants from C. America to move through their country and into ours.  I was just curious how Turkey was accomplishing this.","p062","p029",2,1,1,2.3333
5992,19,243,5,"Person 2","ahhh gotcha.  Maybe some form of heightened border patrol?  Good question.","p062","p029",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
5993,19,243,6,"Person 1","Yeah.  I'd think that once the migrants got into Turkey it would be harder to do anything about them.  Either way this is a big challenge for Europe.","p062","p029",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
5994,19,243,7,"Person 2","Yeah definitely!  And it doesn't seem like it will be getting better anytime soon.","p062","p029",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
5995,19,243,8,"Person 1","Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or if there is one.  Certainly it has to do with reforming these peoples' home countries.  That's where the problem starts, of course.  But how to do that.","p062","p029",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
5996,19,243,9,"Person 2","Yeah no doubt,  That's the million dollar question.  I guess it's just really sad for all the innocent victims like the kids","p062","p029",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
5997,19,243,10,"Person 1","Yes, I can't imagine growing up in environments like Syria.  I wonder what the long-term repercussions are for the health and well being of children raised there, whether or not they're forced to flee.","p062","p029",3,2,3.3333,2.6667
5998,19,243,11,"Person 2","Yeah and if it has an impact on relationships, like are people scared to get close to each other bc you can lose people so easily","p062","p029",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
5999,19,243,12,"Person 1","Yeah, that's an interesting point.  I'd never thought of that.  I'd certainly be devastated losing someone close, so i could definitely see myself being hesitant to get close to people.","p062","p029",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6000,19,243,13,"Person 2","Yeah, how very tragic.  I guess it makes me grateful to live in this beautiful country","p062","p029",3,1,2.3333,2.3333
6001,19,243,14,"Person 1","Indeed.  I wonder what birth rates are like in these countries while these things are going on.  And what the birth rates are like for refugees once they get to a new country where they feel safe.  Not sure it's important, just curious, I suppose.","p062","p029",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
6002,19,243,15,"Person 2","Yeah that would be interesting to see!  Like does it affect their willingness to have more children","p062","p029",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
6003,19,243,16,"Person 1","I'd certainly hope that living in a warzone would give people pause, but who knows.  I never put it past people to have children they probably would be better off not having.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
6004,19,243,17,"Person 2","Well there are so many horrendous parents out there, it is sometimes astonishing so yeah, I agree","p062","p029",2.3333,2,1.3333,3
6005,19,243,18,"Person 1","I'm amazed that Germany agreed to take 1 million refugees.  I wonder what the reaction in Germany was like.","p062","p029",2.6667,1,1.3333,2
6006,19,243,19,"Person 2","I was also shocked by that!  Like, what the heck!?!?  That will surely have an impact on their economy.  Well I gotta run, it's been great chatting with you.  Have a great weekend.  bye!","p062","p029",3,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333

6009,19,244,1,"Person 2","neither can i, it sounds awful","p073","p009",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
6010,19,244,2,"Person 1","I guess risking your life to leave would be worth it when you are already living in such a dangerous area.","p073","p009",3,1.3333,3.6667,2
6011,19,244,3,"Person 2","yeah im sure thats what motivates them","p073","p009",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
6012,19,244,4,"Person 1","I wonder how this situation is now. The article said Obama was president at the time. It said 1 out of every 50 people in the country had been killed at that time.","p073","p009",2,1,3,1
6013,19,244,5,"Person 2","i dont know. i know isis has been basically completely taken out of the area since then","p073","p009",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333

6016,19,244,8,"Person 1","It really makes me thankful that I can live somewhere that I am not constantly in fear of my life. I just feel so horribly for anyone that has to live in that type of situation.","p073","p009",4,1,2.3333,2.3333
6017,19,244,9,"Person 2","me too, especially children","p073","p009",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
6018,19,244,10,"Person 1","Yeah, and to be a parent of a small child, to see their innocence and want to protect that for them.","p073","p009",4,1.6667,1.6667,2
6019,19,244,11,"Person 2","true","p073","p009",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
6020,19,244,12,"Person 1","If I was in that situation I would try to leave too.","p073","p009",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6021,19,244,13,"Person 2","me too. i just wish the country was more stable so that noone of them had to leave their homes","p073","p009",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
6022,19,244,14,"Person 1","That would be best. I can't imagine having to leave whatever you have and go to a new country and start from nothing.","p073","p009",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
6023,19,244,15,"Person 2","that would be horrible!","p073","p009",4.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
6024,19,244,16,"Person 1","Actually thinking about it that way, I don't know if I would have the courage to leave.","p073","p009",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
6025,19,244,17,"Person 2","you probably would if you were in those conditions","p073","p009",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
6026,19,244,18,"Person 1","Maybe, but it would be really scary. I can't imagine having to start a completely new life in a new country. The people that do leave must be very strong people!","p073","p009",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
6027,19,244,19,"Person 2","definitely. desperation plays a role too","p073","p009",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
6028,19,244,20,"Person 1","True, I guess it's choosing the best between two not great things.","p073","p009",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

6058,177,246,1,"Person 2","No, not really.  I didn't care for her or the Clintons so there is that.  I'm sorry for the loss of a life and the loss for the loved ones left behind I suppose.  How about you?","p009","p029",3,2,1.3333,3
6059,177,246,2,"Person 1","It was interesting to learn about her. Famous politicians always fascinate me whether i agree with their views or not","p009","p029",2,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6060,177,246,3,"Person 2","Yeah it is always interesting to read.  I agree with that for sure.","p009","p029",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2
6061,177,246,4,"Person 1","i am too young to remember a lot of her, i almost remember the saturday night live sketches of her more than her actual deeds","p009","p029",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
6062,177,246,5,"Person 2","hahaha.  I find anyone associated with the Clintons to be distasteful but whatever, at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal to me.","p009","p029",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
6063,177,246,6,"Person 1","yeah i agree with that. dont have much of a soft spot for many politicians these days","p009","p029",2,2,2.3333,2.6667

6065,177,246,8,"Person 1","they probably wouldnt spare any tears for any of us lol","p009","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
6066,177,246,9,"Person 2","lol no I seriously doubt they would.  I think most of what they do is just an act put on for the public.  It is definitely interesting to read about though.","p009","p029",2,2,1.6667,2
6067,177,246,10,"Person 1","yeah tahts true i agree","p009","p029",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
6068,177,246,11,"Person 2","I was young during the whole Janet Reno era too, I just remember her name being mentioned at the time.  Some of the things the article mentioned were disturbing.","p009","p029",2.6667,2,2,2.6667
6069,177,246,12,"Person 1","i agree with that. like i said most of my memories of her were from SNL haha","p009","p029",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6070,177,246,13,"Person 2","haha I Never saw that show before, but I know what it is.  I'm sure Parkinson's is probably an unpleasant way to go.","p009","p029",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
6071,177,246,14,"Person 1","yeah i definitely agree there","p009","p029",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667

6079,177,247,2,"Person 1","yeah, did you hear about her before this article?","p024","p030",1,1,1,1.3333
6080,177,247,3,"Person 2","I had, but I was a very small child during the Clinton admin, so I didn't really know her function or capacity as a politician.","p024","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,2.3333

6087,177,247,10,"Person 1","I just know you lose your memory","p024","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
6088,177,247,11,"Person 2","Is that part of it? Doesn't it make your hands shake also?","p024","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6089,177,247,12,"Person 1","yeah I believe that happens too","p024","p030",1,1,1,1.6667
6090,177,247,13,"Person 2","Do you think there will be another female attorney general in the near future?","p024","p030",2,1,1,1.3333
6091,177,247,14,"Person 1","most likely. once the first one comes through it opens the door one would think for the next generation of females. whats your opinion?","p024","p030",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2
6092,177,247,15,"Person 2","I think its likely. I don't know who it might be though.","p024","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
6093,177,247,16,"Person 1","yeah i have no idea about politics to be honest","p024","p030",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
6094,177,247,17,"Person 2","I follow them with mild interest. It gets to be very depressing after a while though. Do you vote?","p024","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
6095,177,247,18,"Person 1","yeah I definitely vote. More likely to vote now with all that trouble going on in the white house.","p024","p030",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667

6097,177,247,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p030",1,1,1,1
6098,177,248,0,"Person 1","The thing I remember most about Janet Reno is Will Ferrell playing her on Saturday Night Live.","p062","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1,2.3333
6099,177,248,1,"Person 2","I remember that. I'm glad she broke barriers for women","p062","p035",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
6100,177,248,2,"Person 1","Actually, I'm just kidding.  I remember her for her actual job.  She was a very high profile Attorney General.  A lot of really big events took place in the 1990s with her involved.","p062","p035",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6101,177,248,3,"Person 2","Yeah, but looking back at her work with the Clinton makes me wonder.","p062","p035",2,2,1,2
6102,177,248,4,"Person 1","She certainly didn't get out of her job with a squeaky clean reputation.","p062","p035",2.6667,2,1,1.6667
6103,177,248,5,"Person 2","How do you think that era will be looked at in history?","p062","p035",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
6104,177,248,6,"Person 1","That's a good question.  I suppose it depends on who you ask.  But it was post-Cold War and Clinton didn't do much overseas, so it was mostly domestic stuff.  Clinton scandals, domestic terrorism, and a good economy.  I guess those are the things I remember.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333
6105,177,248,7,"Person 2","Yeah, with all this 92 crime bill talk, makes me look at the whole group differently.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
6106,177,248,8,"Person 1","What's the 92 crime bill talk?","p062","p035",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
6107,177,248,9,"Person 2","Mainly Joe Biden voting for Clinton's 92 crime bill","p062","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
6108,177,248,10,"Person 1","Okay.  Do you think the crime bill was driven by malice or just ignorance?","p062","p035",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
6109,177,248,11,"Person 2","Both","p062","p035",1,1.6667,1.3333,2
6110,177,248,12,"Person 1","Hmm.  Back to Reno for a second, I wonder if her \"stiffness\" was related to her eventual Parkinson's.  I assume it was, although I don't know much about Parkinson's, at least in its early form.","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
6111,177,248,13,"Person 2","It could have been, my grandmother had Parkinson's and it locked up her arms and hands","p062","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,3
6112,177,248,14,"Person 1","I thought the quote from Holder was interesting about Reno always asking what the \"right\" thing to do was, since neither of them always did the right thing.","p062","p035",2,2,1.3333,2.3333
6113,177,248,15,"Person 2","As I get older I look at all people in high positions as being human and having the same flaws as everybody else.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
6114,177,248,16,"Person 1","So do you think that pretty much anyone who got to those positions would corrupt and do sketchy or even illegal things?","p062","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6115,177,248,17,"Person 2","Yes, most people look of for their best interest. I think congress both parties have sold out the American people.","p062","p035",2,2,1.6667,2
6116,177,248,18,"Person 1","Yeah.  I also tend to think that the rare person who WOULD remain truly ethical and pure would never rise to the heights of national office.  I don't think they'd ever get there in the first place.  You have to be more ruthless and self-serving than that.","p062","p035",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
6117,177,248,19,"Person 2","Agreed. I think the two party system is for us the people to fight while the people at the top keep enjoying the soils","p062","p035",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.6667
6118,177,248,20,"Person 1","Yes, it certainly seems like a rich-get-richer type system at this point.  Oh well, at least everyone, including apparently Janet Reno, eventually dies.  That's gotta be some relief.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Have a great day.  bye","p062","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333

6123,177,249,3,"Person 2","I didn't watch the news much growing up so I had no idea ho she was before reading this. It;s so sad she suffered from parkinsons for 20 years.","p024","p020",3.3333,2,2.3333,3
6124,177,249,4,"Person 1","that disease is terrible","p024","p020",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
6125,177,249,5,"Person 2","i cannot even imagine having it. Constantly moving, but I wonder if any medicine can control it some","p024","p020",3.3333,2,3,2
6126,177,249,6,"Person 1","yeah and forgetting things thats scary","p024","p020",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
6127,177,249,7,"Person 2","I saw a video online of a lady with dementia and herson took her out to dinner and she didn't recognize him at all. It broke my heart.","p024","p020",4,2,2.6667,3
6128,177,249,8,"Person 1","yeah my father had a stroke a few years back and the only thing I was worried about was if he would recognize us all, thankfully he did others are not so lucky.","p024","p020",3.3333,1,2.6667,3.6667
6129,177,249,9,"Person 2","I'm so sorry! That had to be so scary. I am glad he recognized you. That is a big fear of  mine , forgetting people or having someone you love forget you.","p024","p020",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,3.3333
6130,177,249,10,"Person 1","Thanks and yeah I hope they find something out or figure out ways to repair the brain","p024","p020",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333

6133,177,249,13,"Person 2","It makes me greatful for everyday I have with my family. Sometimes I forget to be thankfull in the small stresses of life","p024","p020",4,0.3333,2,3
6134,177,249,14,"Person 1","I agree we wake up and see our family and think nothing of it like its supposed to be this way at all times. Little do we know we are lucky to be that healthy still.","p024","p020",4,0.6667,2.3333,3
6135,177,249,15,"Person 2","That;s a great way to look at it. Enjoy the times now and try to be happy so when you need to look back at the memories they bring you joy.","p024","p020",3.3333,0,1.3333,2.6667
6136,177,249,16,"Person 1","Yeah most people dont realize that.","p024","p020",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6137,177,249,17,"Person 2","It stinks that it takes bad things happening for that wake up call","p024","p020",3.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
6138,177,249,18,"Person 1","Yeah, its just how we are naturally","p024","p020",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6139,177,249,19,"Person 2","Maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss","p024","p020",2.6667,1,1.3333,2
6140,177,249,20,"Person 1","It's been a great talk! Have a great and blessed day. bye","p024","p020",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
6141,177,249,21,"Person 2","bye","p024","p020",0.6667,1,1,1
6142,177,250,0,"Person 1","What did you think of this?","p029","p048",1,1,0.6667,1
6143,177,250,1,"Person 2","Well it's an interesting article. I think with all political bias' aside, Parkinson's disease is not a fun illness to live with. What do you think about it?","p029","p048",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
6144,177,250,2,"Person 1","Yes, I totally agree.  I did not like her or  her politics, but I have sympathy for anyone who went through that disease as well as their family","p029","p048",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
6145,177,250,3,"Person 2","Yes. It's slightly hard to have sympathy for her specially unfortunately. Not a huge fan of the Clinton's either so their opinion of her isn't helping her case.","p029","p048",2.6667,2,1,2.6667
6146,177,250,4,"Person 1","yeah haha you and me both.  But I am trying to muster some sympathy.  maybe for the family.","p029","p048",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
6147,177,250,5,"Person 2","Yes exactly. I'm not much in to politics but this made me chuckle because it seemed very bias. I'm sure this lady wasn't perfect.","p029","p048",2.3333,1.3333,1,3
6148,177,250,6,"Person 1","Yeah it was biased.  I try to keep up with politics but I'm not fanatical.  Either way, I know enough to know she does not endorse the same things I do.  So maybe I am biased too.","p029","p048",2.3333,1.6667,1,3
6149,177,250,7,"Person 2","I can agree completely. It's the first article I've read on here that I didn't feel any sympathy to be honest","p029","p048",1.6667,1.3333,1,2.6667
6150,177,250,8,"Person 1","haha omg I think me too!!  well I may have seen a few others but this is one of the top for sure.","p029","p048",2,0.6667,1,2.6667
6151,177,250,9,"Person 2","And I was slightly worried I would be matched with a hardcore Clinton lover and it was going to get interesting!","p029","p048",3,0.6667,1,2.6667
6152,177,250,10,"Person 1","hahaha I was too.  No, hardcore Clinton hater here.  sorry not sorry","p029","p048",2.3333,0.6667,1,3
6153,177,250,11,"Person 2","I can 100% agree. I just don't understand the people who can read the news or media and not see the corruption. I rarely read it and can see it!","p029","p048",2.6667,1.6667,1,3
6154,177,250,12,"Person 1","Me too!!!  Are they so blind?  It seriously shocks me.  It is infuriating.","p029","p048",3.3333,2,1,3
6155,177,250,13,"Person 2","It's heartbreaking honestly. I have sympathy for those people for sure!","p029","p048",3.3333,2,1.6667,3.3333
6156,177,250,14,"Person 1","Yeah I guess I should.  I feel like the news is partly to blame bc it is so biased but people should know better","p029","p048",2,2,1,2.3333
6157,177,250,15,"Person 2","It's true. I do feel like media has such a strong impact on the next generation. People are so brainwashed.","p029","p048",2.3333,2,1,2.3333
6158,177,250,16,"Person 1","Yes they really are, and people seem to believe whatever they read.  It is sad really","p029","p048",3,2,1,2
6159,177,250,17,"Person 2","It's crazy really. I do so much research just on selecting a new brand of bread!","p029","p048",3,1.6667,1,2.6667
6160,177,250,18,"Person 1","hahaha you are funny.  I am the same way!!  well thanks for the talk, it has truly been a pleasure.  have a good day, bye!","p029","p048",2.6667,0,1,2.3333
6161,177,250,19,"Person 2","goodbye","p029","p048",1,1,1,1
6162,413,251,0,"Person 1","I found this to be quite tragic.  Any incident like this is just terrible, especially for the families and people involved.","p029","p062",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
6163,413,251,1,"Person 2","Yes, I thought the article showed quite a broad range of experiences.  People trying to survive the incident itself.  People finding out and dealing with dead loved ones.  People angry about it.  Officials trying to maintain safety and order going forward.","p029","p062",4,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
6164,413,251,2,"Person 1","Yeah, it just goes to show how many lives are impacted when something like this happens.  It just seems like it happens all too frequent nowadays.  It's terrible.","p029","p062",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
6165,413,251,3,"Person 2","For sure.  I thought the portrayal of the father was quite poignant.  I found him to be quite reflective and I could really feel his suffering.","p029","p062",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2.6667
6166,413,251,4,"Person 1","Yeah totally, me too.  That impacted me the most out of the entire article.  As a mother of four, that's just the ultimate tragedy for a parent.  I\"m so sad for him.","p029","p062",4.3333,2,3.3333,3.3333
6167,413,251,5,"Person 2","I also wondered about the guilt of the band playing that night.  Angels of Death Metal, I think they were called.  Imagine being the band that night, who advertised for people to come, wanted people to come, and then they were subjected to terror because of it.  They'll have to live with that guilt their whole lives, I'm sure.","p029","p062",3.6667,2,3.6667,3
6168,413,251,6,"Person 1","Yeah, just like in the situation in Las Vegas in the USA.  That concert where so many people were killed.  I can't imagine the band or artist playing wouldn't feel somehow guilty.","p029","p062",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
6169,413,251,7,"Person 2","The other thing that stood out was the description of people hiding and listening to gunfire for like 3 hours.  Starting and stopping.  That would be terrifying.","p029","p062",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
6170,413,251,8,"Person 1","Wouldn't it?  Like crouched in some area not knowing if you'll make it out alive or not.  That's so sad too.","p029","p062",3.6667,2,3.6667,3
6171,413,251,9,"Person 2","I'm sure a lot of people have PTSD from that event.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6172,413,251,10,"Person 1","Oh yeah, no doubt.  It would be traumatizing probably for the rest of their lives.","p029","p062",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
6173,413,251,11,"Person 2","I sort of felt ambivalent about them saying they repaired the site and removed any traces of the incident.  On one hand I understand that. on the other I guess I felt like, to some extent you don't want to forget.  You want to admit what happened so you can acknowledge you survived it.","p029","p062",2.3333,1,3,2.6667
6174,413,251,12,"Person 1","Yeah that's a really good point.  Like they should have done something else to signify the fact that a tragedy happened there for the survivors maybe.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
6175,413,251,13,"Person 2","I also wondered what the increased governmental powers that were mentioned referred to.  Sort of like the US with the Patriot Act after 9/11.  A lot of how France reacted seemed pretty consistent with how the U.S. responds.","p029","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
6176,413,251,14,"Person 1","Yeah, did they mention what those powers specifically were?  Perhaps they were following the lead of the U.S.","p029","p062",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
6177,413,251,15,"Person 2","No, I don't think they mentioned specifics.  I wondered if it was something akin to Marshall Law, like curfews or just the power to search people or something.","p029","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
6178,413,251,16,"Person 1","Yeah probably so.  Things like that seem to follow mass tragedies like this.","p029","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
6179,413,251,17,"Person 2","I think we've been pretty good at preventing this type of terrorism (I'm ignoring domestic terrorism/mass shootings) for a while.  Hopefully that's a sign we can police it or that the forces behind it are being defeated or something.","p029","p062",2.3333,0,1.6667,2.6667
6180,413,251,18,"Person 1","Hopefully you are right.  I think we must remain vigilant.  Hope you enjoy your day, goodbye","p029","p062",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2
6181,413,251,19,"Person 2","Yes, it was nice talking to you.  I agree, this is something we'll have to be diligent about for a long time.  Have a good day, too. bye","p029","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6182,413,252,0,"Person 1","It is a bit sad to say but i had forgotten about this terrorist attack because of how often they happen now a days but reading this article is so heartbreaking.","p028","p024",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
6183,413,252,1,"Person 2","yeah I had totally forgotten about this attack as well","p028","p024",2,1.3333,1.3333,2
6184,413,252,2,"Person 1","It makes me upset in a way that the fact that we can even forget about something this horrific is possible. It feels like nothing is being done, or at least nothing is being accomplished.","p028","p024",3.3333,2,2,1.6667
6185,413,252,3,"Person 2","what do you think can be done to prevent these things in the future","p028","p024",1,1,1,1
6186,413,252,4,"Person 1","I am not sure really. I want to say just stop trying to meddle in other countries business cause that is what creates resentment and these people.","p028","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
6187,413,252,5,"Person 2","countries shouldnt behave like the world police i agree","p028","p024",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
6188,413,252,6,"Person 1","Let the other countries solve their problems on their own and focus on the problems we have at home cause there are many of them. But then the world may look at those countries as selfish no?","p028","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
6189,413,252,7,"Person 2","i just say we focus on our own problems and let them deal with their own as well","p028","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
6190,413,252,8,"Person 1","Yeah i agree. I feel so bad for all of those families effected also. There must have been some who lost more than one person in the attack.","p028","p024",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
6191,413,252,9,"Person 2","I can only imagine the pain they went through...","p028","p024",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6192,413,252,10,"Person 1","I always wonder how someone who survives something like that moves on afterwords, i feel like feeling safe after is difficult.","p028","p024",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2
6193,413,252,11,"Person 2","hopefully they receive the correct help from people trained for those types of situations","p028","p024",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
6194,413,252,12,"Person 1","Yeah for sure, Reading the article is always harder when they include names and faces. Really reminds you that these are people instead of just the number of them hurt.","p028","p024",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6195,413,252,13,"Person 2","Yeah, for example Denys Plaud who survived because when the attackers burst in he was up on the balcony where there was more room.","p028","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1
6196,413,252,14,"Person 1","Yeah he was lucky, it really feels like at it is just about being lucky sometimes to live through these things","p028","p024",2,0,2.6667,1.6667
6197,413,252,15,"Person 2","its about being lucky and being at the right place at the right time. too many things tbh i rather just not be in that situation","p028","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
6198,413,252,16,"Person 1","Definetely so many of things, just everything completely out of your control. Hopefully something like that does not happen again soon.","p028","p024",3,1,2.3333,1.3333
6199,413,252,17,"Person 2","yeah one can only wish for things to change","p028","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
6200,413,252,18,"Person 1","That and making sure that everyday counts, things like that really remind me of that.","p028","p024",3.3333,0,1.6667,2
6201,413,252,19,"Person 2","life is too short and fragile and these stories reinforce that feeling","p028","p024",3,1.3333,1.6667,2
6202,413,252,20,"Person 1","Definetely, even though the story was heartbreaking it was nice talking to you. goodbye","p028","p024",3,1.3333,1.6667,2
6203,413,252,21,"Person 2","bye","p028","p024",1,1,1,1
6204,413,253,0,"Person 1","This story is horrible.","p073","p014",3.6667,2,3,2
6205,413,253,1,"Person 2","I would tend to agree, its so hard to read that","p073","p014",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
6206,413,253,2,"Person 1","I know, very hard to read. I can't even imagine having to live through it.","p073","p014",4.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
6207,413,253,3,"Person 2","it was so surreal sounding. I can read the words, but its hard to truly imagine it happening","p073","p014",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
6208,413,253,4,"Person 1","Exactly, and I read it buy it was like looking at something and trying so hard not to see it.","p073","p014",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
6209,413,253,5,"Person 2","how the father learned of his daughters death was harrowing too.","p073","p014",4,2,2.6667,2
6210,413,253,6,"Person 1","No one should have to find something like that out on social media, but I don't think anyway of finding that out would be horrible.","p073","p014",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
6211,413,253,7,"Person 2","definitely, there is no easy way to get that news.","p073","p014",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6212,413,253,8,"Person 1","Also, the people that survived it. I think it said it went on for 3 hours, hearing shooting. I can't imagine life ever being normal again after that.","p073","p014",4,2,3,2.6667
6213,413,253,9,"Person 2","I was just thinking something along the same lines. I remember hearing about this when it happened, but I don't remember it being over such a long period of time.","p073","p014",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
6214,413,253,10,"Person 1","Yeah me too, I didn't realize how long it lasted.","p073","p014",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
6215,413,253,11,"Person 2","they must be affected still, as anticipating death for three hours would take a toll on anyone","p073","p014",3,1.6667,2.3333,2
6216,413,253,12,"Person 1","Hopefully the survivors were able to get help.","p073","p014",2.6667,1,2,1.6667
6217,413,253,13,"Person 2","yeah, that feeling of being trapped for so long is really hard to imagine. I hope they find some solace","p073","p014",3.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
6218,413,253,14,"Person 1","It sounded like there were lots of things done in the city to support the victims and survivors, but that probably only helps for a short time.","p073","p014",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6219,413,253,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I don't know how I would feel about it, if I were a relative or a victim to have so much media attention on the anniversary of the day","p073","p014",3,1,2.6667,2.3333
6220,413,253,16,"Person 1","I know, I wonder to. It may help some people, but some people are probably annoyed by it. It's kind of like how my brother died from cancer and I hate all of the cancer t-shirts and ribbons and stuff. I feel like its celebrating cancer.","p073","p014",4.6667,2,3,3.3333
6221,413,253,17,"Person 2","plus its just a reminder of the awfulness that caused the tragedy, and you may not necessarily want to think about it","p073","p014",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
6222,413,253,18,"Person 1","I think that's exactly what it is.","p073","p014",2,1.3333,1.6667,1
6223,413,253,19,"Person 2","at least, they know there are people there for them, if they need them though","p073","p014",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
6224,413,253,20,"Person 1","I'm sure seeing the amount of people that come out for a benefit or maybe send a note or whatever, I'm sure it helps the people a lot. But at the end of the day, that is all gone, and that is probably the most hard time.","p073","p014",3,1,3,2.6667
6225,413,253,21,"Person 2","its definitely a sorrowful event. Thanks for the chat, I think we should wrap it up!","p073","p014",3,2,1.6667,1.3333
6226,413,253,22,"Person 1","you too, bye","p073","p014",1.3333,1,1,1
6227,413,253,23,"Person 2","bye","p073","p014",1,1,1,1
6228,413,254,0,"Person 1","So, how do you feel about the Paris attacks?","p030","p035",0.6667,1,1.6667,1
6229,413,254,1,"Person 2","I think that they are senseless acts of violence, but I also do not think it is wise to made fun of people's religion. What do you think?","p030","p035",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
6230,413,254,2,"Person 1","I agree, I can't imagine being roused from bed with news that a family member had been the victim of a terrorist attack. The racist backlash is just the simplest knee jerk reaction to this kind of thing when there is no other revenge to be had.","p030","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
6231,413,254,3,"Person 2","I would hate to find out one of my children were killed on social media.","p030","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,3
6232,413,254,4,"Person 1","Yeah, of all the details that was the most barbed.","p030","p035",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
6233,413,254,5,"Person 2","Do you think the victim's father will find real peace?","p030","p035",1.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
6234,413,254,6,"Person 1","I think it depends on the type of person he is. Something tells me this is the kind of thing that will always haunt you.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
6235,413,254,7,"Person 2","Yeah, I would like to think I would not be hateful, but I have never been in his shoes.","p030","p035",2.3333,1,2.6667,2.6667
6236,413,254,8,"Person 1","I was speaking more about the loss of a child than focusing hatred on the shooters, but thankfully I don't have any firsthand experience either.","p030","p035",2,0.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6237,413,254,9,"Person 2","No matter how a child dies, natural causes, accident or murder I do not think a parent ever gets over it.","p030","p035",3,1,3.3333,2.3333
6238,413,254,10,"Person 1","Right. I'm curious as to what the demographics were of the rest of the crowd.","p030","p035",2,1,2,1.6667
6239,413,254,11,"Person 2","That is a good question. Do you think these types of terrorist acts of mass shooting are just going to be the norm from here on out?","p030","p035",2,1,2.6667,1.3333
6240,413,254,12,"Person 1","Fortunately, attacks of this scale don't happen very often. I think that there will be even more of a threat now with so many people emigrating from the middle east to new homes in Europe.","p030","p035",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
6241,413,254,13,"Person 2","Do you see the immigrants as the threat or attacks on the immigrants by like in New Zealand","p030","p035",1.6667,1,2,2
6242,413,254,14,"Person 1","I see racism and nationalism as the threat. The quickest way for someone to find themselves in this terrorist groups is to be alienated and discriminated against.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,3
6243,413,254,15,"Person 2","Sadly, I agree. I wish people can see that we are more alike than different.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.6667
6244,413,254,16,"Person 1","People love to have a simple solution to the complex problems that they have to deal with every day. Blaming immigrants is the easiest way to explain away all of their problems at once all while creating a common enemy.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
6245,413,254,17,"Person 2","I agree. I think most of thinking is pushed by the people at the top of the class system for the people at the bottom fight each other and do not look at them.","p030","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
6246,413,254,18,"Person 1","Yep, the same tactics have been used for millennia and continue to be effective.","p030","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
6247,413,254,19,"Person 2","What do you think about the book that the father was making in honor of his daughter?","p030","p035",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
6248,413,254,20,"Person 1","I think it is a very thoughtful was to memorialize anyone. I hope that he can one day find peace through constructive activities like that. Thanks for chatting today! bye","p030","p035",2.6667,0,3,2.3333
6249,413,254,21,"Person 2","Nice chatting with you too! bye","p030","p035",2,0,1.3333,1
6250,413,255,0,"Person 1","Always sadder to experience these events from the perspective of individual people, like the father, I think.","p062","p029",3.3333,2,4,2
6251,413,255,1,"Person 2","yeah his story was truly heartbreaking.  can you imagine","p062","p029",4,2,3.3333,2
6252,413,255,2,"Person 1","And also the terror that one guy made me feel as he and others hid in the balcony and listened to the gunfire for three hours.","p062","p029",4.3333,2,3.6667,1.6667
6253,413,255,3,"Person 2","yeah those were the two main things that stood out to me too.  The fear, it's just unimaginable.","p062","p029",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
6254,413,255,4,"Person 1","They didn't talk about it, but I'd feel terrible if I was the band playing that night.  I'd feel like I'd encouraged people to come to this event and then many of them died and all were traumatized.","p062","p029",4,2,4.3333,3
6255,413,255,5,"Person 2","yeah it would almost feel like it was your fault wouldn't it.  ugh.","p062","p029",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
6256,413,255,6,"Person 1","We haven't had one of these big terrorist acts (ignoring domestic mass shootings) in a while it seems.  In Europe or here.  Hopefully that means we're getting better at policing them, or the terrorists are dwindling in numbers or resources or sometihng.","p062","p029",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6257,413,255,7,"Person 2","I really hope so.  when was the last one on american soil?","p062","p029",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6258,413,255,8,"Person 1","Yeah, I'm trying to think.  Maybe that thing in California where that couple used assault rifles and stuff to shoot at their coworkers or whatever it was. But that was a few years ago, I think.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6259,413,255,9,"Person 2","yeah that is exactly what i was thinking","p062","p029",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
6260,413,255,10,"Person 1","And even that was a peculiar thing because I think they'd been here so long.  I get the feeling that it's gotten very hard to get explosives and things necessary for anything more than single people shooting or running over people.  And even then we're not seeing those types of attacks.","p062","p029",1.6667,1,2,2
6261,413,255,11,"Person 2","San Bernardino I think.  but yeah, hopefully it is dying down.  it is the domestic incidents that are still a major concern here","p062","p029",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6262,413,255,12,"Person 1","I wonder if the rise of ISIS in the middle east has their focus on that region.  Regardless of what people think about foreign wars, I do think it encourages the \"battle\" to be fought elsewhere, and not on our home soil.","p062","p029",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
6263,413,255,13,"Person 2","maybe so, that is an interesting perspective","p062","p029",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
6264,413,255,14,"Person 1","But yeah, we've got plenty of domestic incidents to be concerned about regardless.","p062","p029",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
6265,413,255,15,"Person 2","seriously.  I don't even like going to crowded places anymore.","p062","p029",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,3.3333
6266,413,255,16,"Person 1","Yeah, although I'd encourage you to keep it in perspective. You'd be as likely to win Powerball as to be the direct victim of one of these things.  Though both events are technically possible.","p062","p029",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
6267,413,255,17,"Person 2","I don't know.  I think there are more shooting victims than powerball winners, but either way I don't like crowds to start with so it's not like I'm sacrificing something I love.","p062","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3.3333
6268,413,255,18,"Person 1","Okay, well that's good.  I'm not too big on crowds myself.","p062","p029",2.6667,0.6667,1.3333,3
6269,413,255,19,"Person 2","Yeah it is just not appealing.  I'd rather be home with my family and close loved ones.  Well it has been good talking to you, have a good day!!  bye","p062","p029",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,3
6270,413,255,20,"Person 1","Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p062","p029",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1
6271,174,256,0,"Person 1","Kidnapping children is the most cowardly thing someone can do","p024","p062",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
6272,174,256,1,"Person 2","Yes, this is a pretty vile story.  Truly disgusting.","p024","p062",4,2,2,2.6667
6273,174,256,2,"Person 1","Very disgusting indeed","p024","p062",3.6667,2,2,3
6274,174,256,3,"Person 2","I'm not sure what the solution is but I certainly feel no sympathy for however ISIS is wiped out.","p024","p062",3.3333,2,1.3333,3.3333
6275,174,256,4,"Person 1","probably just hurt their finances freeze all accounts instead of the usual drone strikes? But who knows they would still find ways around it","p024","p062",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6276,174,256,5,"Person 2","Yeah, and I'm not actually sure what their strength is at this point.  Their influence outside the region certainly seems limited.","p024","p062",1.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
6277,174,256,6,"Person 1","theyre definitely not that influential outside of that region thats for sure","p024","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
6278,174,256,7,"Person 2","I sometimes wonder about the general temperament of some of these populations.  In the US we went to war against our \"oppressors.\"  At what point do these middle eastern populations get fed up with dictators and other oppressive groups?  The people have plenty of guns.  They can form militias too.  I'd rather go down fighting than just be executed in the street.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3.3333
6279,174,256,8,"Person 1","They're programmed to believe these fighers are for their religion. If they go against them they would probably be told they are going against islam and all that talk.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
6280,174,256,9,"Person 2","Yeah, that could certainly be the case.  Many forces and a lot of history acting on the people in these places, I guess.","p024","p062",1,1,1.6667,2
6281,174,256,10,"Person 1","I feel like its a lost hope in that part of the world. I don't know if its the CIA creating these groups or what, but its been going on for a while now.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6282,174,256,11,"Person 2","Yeah, it's probably pretty futile.  The issues are long-standing and complicated and oftentimes we don't fully understand them.","p024","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
6283,174,256,12,"Person 1","There's a lot that goes on that we don't know","p024","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
6284,174,256,13,"Person 2","It's also sort of interesting how we've been allies and enemies of the same groups at different times.  So in many ways there aren't always good guys and bad guys, clear and simple.","p024","p062",2,1,2,2.3333
6285,174,256,14,"Person 1","its tought to pull the trigger on the cause of why the groups are created","p024","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6286,174,256,15,"Person 2","I just hoped that trying to establish democracy in the region, like in Iraq, would give the people a greater sense or power and responsibility for their own fates.  But maybe that was too much to hope for.  Look at Russia.  They get out from under the burden of communism and many want to return to it, and they're happy with a de facto dictator like Putin.","p024","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3.6667
6287,174,256,16,"Person 1","remember Libya. They had a pretty good dictator who had the country going well yet somehow they revolted against him and now look at that country.","p024","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
6288,174,256,17,"Person 2","Yeah, it's a mess.  I guess I'm thankful I live in this part of the world.  We find a lot to complain about, but it could certainly be worse.","p024","p062",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,3.3333
6289,174,256,18,"Person 1","yeah i rather be here than there thats for sure","p024","p062",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
6290,174,256,19,"Person 2","My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and is counting down the days until he leaves.","p024","p062",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6291,174,256,20,"Person 1","i would never want to live there its too backwards. its been a good talk bro. bye","p024","p062",2,2,1.3333,2.3333
6292,174,256,21,"Person 2","yeah, see ya.  bye","p024","p062",1.3333,1,1,1
6293,174,257,0,"Person 1","Well this article just made me really grateful to be an American.  The horrors those people are enduring are truly outlandish.","p029","p030",4.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
6294,174,257,1,"Person 2","And for what? The aggressors must know that this is a fight they can't win.","p029","p030",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
6295,174,257,2,"Person 1","Yeah, it is just needless and senseless suffering and loss of innocent human lives.  The ultimate tragedy really","p029","p030",4.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6296,174,257,3,"Person 2","I mean, I can understand the whole, \"If we can't have it were not going to let anyone have it\" mindset. The resolve it must take to raze entire villages, families and resources to the ground is really something/","p029","p030",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
6297,174,257,4,"Person 1","Yeah, no doubt.  How do these people sleep at night?  It's gotta be an entirely different cultural mindset, I just can't even fathom it.","p029","p030",4,2,2,2.6667
6298,174,257,5,"Person 2","It's just basic dehumanization. It's used the world over to create a common enemy that doesn't deserve to share the air that you breathe. Since these people don't believe the same twisted dogma I do, I am doing them a favor by killing/persecuting them. I'm sure many of these murderers sleep quite well at night.","p029","p030",4,1.6667,3,2.3333
6299,174,257,6,"Person 1","I'm sure they do, it's just so ridiculous and crazy to me that other human beings can function and behave this way.","p029","p030",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
6300,174,257,7,"Person 2","It's almost anachronistic in this day and age, but these countries just haven't progressed socially or technologically at the same rate as the west due to oppressive religiosity. It's like a snapshot from 200 years ago.","p029","p030",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
6301,174,257,8,"Person 1","Yeah it is.  It seems quite primitive really.  The mindset, the behaviors, all of that.","p029","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
6302,174,257,9,"Person 2","Primitive, but effective.","p029","p030",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6303,174,257,10,"Person 1","Is it effective?  How so??","p029","p030",1.3333,1,2.3333,1
6304,174,257,11,"Person 2","Fear and intimidation are effective no matter where you are on the planet.","p029","p030",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
6305,174,257,12,"Person 1","Yeah but effective for what?  I don't see anything positive happening over there or getting accomplished, and like you said the aggressors must know this is a fight they can't win.  Everybody loses.","p029","p030",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
6306,174,257,13,"Person 2","Control. You think the warlords at the top of the ladder aren't living like kings? That's how young men are coerced into joining unwinnable fights like this. It may be myopic, but in the short term someone is making a lot of money.","p029","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6307,174,257,14,"Person 1","Ehh, I still think it's an ineffective and pointless thing.  It's been going on for as long as history can even record with no real resolution or accomplishment.  It's just a failed endeavor.","p029","p030",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
6308,174,257,15,"Person 2","I guess it's about perspective.","p029","p030",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
6309,174,257,16,"Person 1","I reckon so.  I personally see it as totally pointless and ineffective and truly an atrocity against humans.","p029","p030",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
6310,174,257,17,"Person 2","And a far right radical Muslim sees the death of each and every blasphemer as a victory in the eyes of his God. They perceive their task as divine. I'm not condoning their behavior, I'm saying that perception is relative.","p029","p030",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
6311,174,257,18,"Person 1","Most human people, however, would see it as a monstrosity.  Have a good day, goodbye.","p029","p030",3.3333,2,2.3333,2

6325,174,258,12,"Person 1","it makes me think about what I complain about in my life most of the time is really nothing compared to what some people in the world are dealing with.","p035","p064",3.3333,1.3333,3,3.3333
6326,174,258,13,"Person 2","Exactly, its all first world problems compared to this. This is pure evil","p035","p064",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667

6329,174,258,16,"Person 1","Yeah, it is a real complex problem","p035","p064",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333

6339,174,259,0,"Person 1","Reading about the crisis that these villagers are in is pretty upsetting and scary, do you think other countries should step in and help?","p028","p073",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
6340,174,259,1,"Person 2","I can't imagine not helping in this situation. It is absolutely horrifying.","p028","p073",4,2,3,2.6667
6341,174,259,2,"Person 1","It really is, over 5,000 of them hurt taken and just used as hostages it is just horrifying. I wonder just how the government and country even let it get to this point.","p028","p073",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
6342,174,259,3,"Person 2","I know, over 90% of the people in the village had been kidnapped.","p028","p073",3,2,3.3333,1.3333
6343,174,259,4,"Person 1","So many people, must be awful to be a family member of those taken. Just not knowing if they are safe. Just left to assume the worst.","p028","p073",4,2,4.3333,3
6344,174,259,5,"Person 2","And for the people that are walking, being used as human shields. One mother was pushing her disabled son in a wheelchair.","p028","p073",3.3333,2,4.3333,2.6667
6345,174,259,6,"Person 1","Horrifying, i really wonder why we do not here more about things like this in other parts of the world.","p028","p073",4,2,3.3333,2
6346,174,259,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it's hard to believe that this kind of thing is happening in the world today.","p028","p073",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
6347,174,259,8,"Person 1","Very hard to believe. You would think that massive tragedies like this shouldn't happen anymore. I wonder how much longer until Iraq is a stable country,","p028","p073",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
6348,174,259,9,"Person 2","Or if it will ever be stable.","p028","p073",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
6349,174,259,10,"Person 1","I have to believe it will be eventually. But at the same time i feel like the US has been there for the last 20 years and it is in the same spot. Maybe outside help isn't working","p028","p073",2,2,2,2
6350,174,259,11,"Person 2","Hopefully it's moving in the right direction, but if things like this story are still happening, it is very far from being stable.","p028","p073",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
6351,174,259,12,"Person 1","Definitely a long way to go. But other countries that have gone through terrible crises like this have recovered so maybe hoping and believing it will get better is okay.","p028","p073",1.6667,0.3333,2,2.6667
6352,174,259,13,"Person 2","That's true. Love the optimism!","p028","p073",3,0.3333,2,2.6667
6353,174,259,14,"Person 1","Thanks, hard to be optimistic when stuff like this happens but better that than sulk. Do you think airstrikes are the right way to solve the issue, i feel like it just creates more resentment.","p028","p073",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
6354,174,259,15,"Person 2","I would think at this point airstrikes would be hard since they have all of the civilians with them. I guess if they are targeting something that is distant to them but would cause them to release the people.","p028","p073",2,1.3333,3,2
6355,174,259,16,"Person 1","Yeah the impact it could have on the villagers is also incredibly scary. It seems like no matter what they are at risk of being harmed to get rid of the militants but as long as an effort is being made to free them.","p028","p073",2,2,3.6667,2.3333
6356,174,259,17,"Person 2","If they could somehow get the villagers away and then attack, but I don't know how they could do that. Maybe since the villagers are walking in front of the militants, they could get to them first, get them to safety and then go after the militants.","p028","p073",1.6667,1.3333,3.6667,2
6357,174,259,18,"Person 1","Yeah maybe, hopefully they just keep the safety of the villagers as one of their biggest priorities. Don't want more people to be hurt and make the situation even worse.","p028","p073",2.3333,1,3.3333,2.3333
6358,174,259,19,"Person 2","I just hope that something can be figured out to help those people.","p028","p073",3,1,2.3333,2.6667
6359,174,259,20,"Person 1","Yeah so do i, well it was nice talking to you even if it was about something sad. goodbye","p028","p073",2,1,2,1.6667

6362,174,260,1,"Person 2","I think it's horrific, using people as human shields is crazy.","p009","p058",4.3333,2,3.6667,3
6363,174,260,2,"Person 1","I agree, its very sad","p009","p058",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6364,174,260,3,"Person 2","I wonder what can be done about this, I mean, there's already a war being fought. What else can be done.","p009","p058",3,1.6667,2,2
6365,174,260,4,"Person 1","probably nothing except for destroying the islamic state","p009","p058",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6366,174,260,5,"Person 2","I wish the article mentioned when this apparently took place. It didn't even say when the article was written.","p009","p058",2.3333,1,2,1.6667
6367,174,260,6,"Person 1","im sure its something thats been going on for a while now","p009","p058",1,1,2,1.6667
6368,174,260,7,"Person 2","Can you imagine being forced out of your home and made to be someones shield in case they get shot at? Unbelievable.","p009","p058",4,2,4,2
6369,174,260,8,"Person 1","No way. but i guess they werent given much of a choice","p009","p058",2.6667,2,3,2
6370,174,260,9,"Person 2","Yeah. It said 5000 people had been kidnapped.","p009","p058",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
6371,174,260,10,"Person 1","That is awful. i feel badly for them","p009","p058",3,2,3.3333,2.6667
6372,174,260,11,"Person 2","yeah it's horrible. things like this probably happen on the regular over there too.","p009","p058",3,2,3,2.3333
6373,174,260,12,"Person 1","That and even worse. Its really sad that everything is so terrible for those people","p009","p058",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
6374,174,260,13,"Person 2","I think if i were there my main priority would be to leave that country by any means necessary.","p009","p058",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
6375,174,260,14,"Person 1","i agree but i think it may not be so easy for them","p009","p058",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
6376,174,260,15,"Person 2","yeah its definitely hard to escape that","p009","p058",2,2,3,2.3333
6377,174,260,16,"Person 1","hopefully things can change and improve for them soon","p009","p058",2,0.6667,3,2.3333
6378,174,260,17,"Person 2","im honestly not very optimistic about that. i think that place will be a war zone for a long time","p009","p058",2.6667,2,2.3333,3
6379,174,260,18,"Person 1","I agree. but i still am hopeful. nice talking to you, goodbye","p009","p058",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2
6380,174,260,19,"Person 2","you too, goodbye","p009","p058",1,1,1,1
6381,34,261,0,"Person 1","I found it kinda hard to connect to this article.  It's defiitely sad for the families involved.","p029","p058",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
6382,34,261,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I feel like I've been desensitized to what's going on over there. The war has been going on for so long.","p029","p058",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
6383,34,261,2,"Person 1","Yeah seriously, like as long as I can remember.  It's just sorta a constant thing.  The way they described it, it sounds like a problem without much solution really.","p029","p058",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
6384,34,261,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I don't see a solution at all. After all these years of war, it's still hell over there.","p029","p058",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6385,34,261,4,"Person 1","YEs exactly, like they are just spinning their wheels.  And I'm sorry if this sounds bad but I don't particularly think we can afford to keep accepting more and more and more refugees.","p029","p058",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
6386,34,261,5,"Person 2","It shouldn't all be on the USA. Helping those people should be a global responsibility. I think helping them to take back their land and make it safe over there for them would be the best option.","p029","p058",1.6667,2,3,2.3333
6387,34,261,6,"Person 1","Yeah exactly, and it feels like we and a few other countries are the only ones taking refugees and trying to help.  I don't know, I'm uninformed about the situation.  That's just how it seems to me.","p029","p058",1.3333,2,3,2.6667
6388,34,261,7,"Person 2","I've heard of a few countries taking some in, but it usually causes crime rates to sky rocket. There's just no good solution.","p029","p058",1.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
6389,34,261,8,"Person 1","Yep, exactly.  There is no good solution.  I do feel sad for people like the children involved and families though.  But what can I do.","p029","p058",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
6390,34,261,9,"Person 2","Nothing. There are people suffering in every country, every city. I mean, you ever hear about how bad things are in north korea? No one dares tackle that problem because of how big of a mess it would cause. What can we do?","p029","p058",2,2,2.3333,2
6391,34,261,10,"Person 1","Oh yeah, it's ridiculously bad over there.  I just feel grateful I live in America.","p029","p058",2.3333,1,2,2.3333
6392,34,261,11,"Person 2","Yeah. These articles leave me with an almost hopeless or helpless feeling. Like I know what's going on, but because there's nothing to be done about it, I almost wish I didn't know.","p029","p058",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
6393,34,261,12,"Person 1","Yes!  Me too!  Like, what the heck?  That would be so awful on so many levels.  Ugh!","p029","p058",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
6394,34,261,13,"Person 2","I really would like to see more positive news coming out of that area. Does it all have to be so negative?","p029","p058",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
6395,34,261,14,"Person 1","Right? Is there nothing positive to report?  Perhaps not?  I don't even like watching movies that are set over there.  Just too depressing.","p029","p058",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
6396,34,261,15,"Person 2","Yeah anytime I hear anything about Afghanistan it's always someone was killed or something bombed, or something else to do with terrorism. I can't remember the last positive thing I've heard about in that area.","p029","p058",2,2,3,2
6397,34,261,16,"Person 1","Yes it is always some tragedy.  There must be normal people living mundane lives there I would think?  I really don't know.","p029","p058",2,2,3,2.3333
6398,34,261,17,"Person 2","Yeah me either. It really puts things into perspective. No matter how bad things are in the USA, it's no where near as bad as it is over there.","p029","p058",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
6399,34,261,18,"Person 1","Yes, if we're being honest I really get sick of hearing people complain about the USA.  My mom is really bad about it.  We may have our (major) problems, but honestly it doesn't even compare to some of these other places.  I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye","p029","p058",2.6667,2,2.6667,3
6400,34,261,19,"Person 2","ok, nice talking to you, goodbye","p029","p058",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1

6402,34,262,1,"Person 2","Hi, the more I read these articles the more helpless I feel.","p009","p030",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
6403,34,262,2,"Person 1","Me too, I feel awful for these people","p009","p030",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
6404,34,262,3,"Person 2","And what can you do about it? Donate to an NGO and then hear more and more about how the situation continues to worsen and  countries have accepted all the refugees they can manage.","p009","p030",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
6405,34,262,4,"Person 1","i dont trust NGOs even. I dont know what the answer is","p009","p030",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
6406,34,262,5,"Person 2","The answer is playing out in front of us. These people will be permanently displaced, sold into slavery and forced into military service.","p009","p030",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
6407,34,262,6,"Person 1","I wish that there was another way","p009","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
6408,34,262,7,"Person 2","Most empathetic people do, but it is beyond the collective will of empathetic people to influence anything on such a grand scale.","p009","p030",3.6667,1,2.6667,2
6409,34,262,8,"Person 1","at least a step in the right direction would be nice","p009","p030",2.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
6410,34,262,9,"Person 2","I think the willingness of places like France and Germany to take in tens of thousands of refugees is a step in the right direction, but this kindness needs to be accompanied by infrastructure that can successfully integrate these people into European society.","p009","p030",2.6667,0.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6411,34,262,10,"Person 1","yeah because there was a whole new problem created by that mass influx a few years ago","p009","p030",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6412,34,262,11,"Person 2","Exactly, foreigners that are brought in and promptly alienated/become the victims of prejudice and hatred will only curry the nationalist attitudes we are seeing today.","p009","p030",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
6413,34,262,12,"Person 1","i think there are problems with both groups.i understand the refugees feeling alienated, but i also understand the europeans being upset over the mass rapings that were happening","p009","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
6414,34,262,13,"Person 2","Huh, i'm not finding any information from reliable sources about mass rapes? Could you send me a trustworthy link?","p009","p030",2,1,2,1.6667
6415,34,262,14,"Person 1","you can google the rotherham child sex scandal and the 2015–16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany where 1200 german women were raped in one night by a roaming gang of refugees. i just wish everyone could get along","p009","p030",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
6416,34,262,15,"Person 2","Goodness, well do you have any ideas to that affect? Helping people to get along?","p009","p030",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
6417,34,262,16,"Person 1","I think it would have to begin with a complete overhaul of everything we have now. Greed is what motivates and that has to change","p009","p030",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
6418,34,262,17,"Person 2","I agree, greed creates poverty and poverty is the biggest problem we have right now.","p009","p030",2,2,3,2.6667

6428,34,263,7,"Person 2","which is understandable if you think about it. family comes first","p035","p024",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
6429,34,263,8,"Person 1","family comes first, but we need to think of ourselves as human family","p035","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
6430,34,263,9,"Person 2","its sad that we will probably never see that happen","p035","p024",2.3333,2,3,3
6431,34,263,10,"Person 1","I agree. I like the part of the article saying that the UN needs to address the root of the problem. Lets make this countries better so people do not need or want to leave.","p035","p024",2,0.3333,2.6667,2.3333
6432,34,263,11,"Person 2","its working with some countries so i guess that is some sort of progress.","p035","p024",1,0.6667,2.6667,2

6435,34,263,14,"Person 1","I agree, I do not think they have a choice.","p035","p024",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
6436,34,263,15,"Person 2","Its a tough life out there","p035","p024",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
6437,34,263,16,"Person 1","Modern weapons make war so much more violent","p035","p024",1.6667,2,2.3333,2
6438,34,263,17,"Person 2","yeah it was much more humane if that can be said in the old days when it was just swords","p035","p024",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
6439,34,263,18,"Person 1","Like you said, a small few can ruin it for a lot of people now days","p035","p024",1.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333

6444,34,264,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think of the article","p022","p031",0.6667,1,1.6667,1
6445,34,264,1,"Person 2","I'm just disgusted with this war-that we have to sacrifice our soldiers and innocents civilians as well","p022","p031",4,2,2.6667,3
6446,34,264,2,"Person 1","It's so bad because these people are pretty much just wanderers.","p022","p031",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
6447,34,264,3,"Person 2","we have no business being there","p022","p031",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
6448,34,264,4,"Person 1","I agree. We should let other countries handle their own business","p022","p031",3,2,2.3333,3
6449,34,264,5,"Person 2","I saw a TV program when they interviews people from Afghanistan and they said, with tears in their eyes, that their way of life was perfectly fine before we came in and brought destruction","p022","p031",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
6450,34,264,6,"Person 1","Wow, that's so sad. We think of our country as so great but others think of us as villains.","p022","p031",3,2,3,2.3333
6451,34,264,7,"Person 2","yes, we-our military are pawns and slaves who serve the evil political interests (mainly the oil or their money over in the middle east)","p022","p031",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
6452,34,264,8,"Person 1","It's just all very corrupt. I wish war would just end.","p022","p031",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
6453,34,264,9,"Person 2","well, with Trump being held up and constantly sabotaged, I don't know when he'll ever get to it","p022","p031",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
6454,34,264,10,"Person 1","That's true. I just feel bad for all the innocent children being affected by this","p022","p031",2.6667,2,3.3333,3
6455,34,264,11,"Person 2","yes, so many young lives and potential lost for nothing","p022","p031",3.3333,2,3,2
6456,34,264,12,"Person 1","They still had their whole lives ahead of them. Would you accept them in our country illegally?","p022","p031",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.3333
6457,34,264,13,"Person 2","I don;t know about that-but what we can do is to help them rebuild their own, because right now our own country cannot take on any more burden-we have so many issues with our own poor and homeless and the economy!","p022","p031",3,2,3,2.6667
6458,34,264,14,"Person 1","I agree, let's leave helping others up to China","p022","p031",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
6459,34,264,15,"Person 2","yes, they have plenty of resources","p022","p031",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
6460,34,264,16,"Person 1","do you know anyone i nwar?","p022","p031",1,1,1.6667,1
6461,34,264,17,"Person 2","No, not presently, but my husband's father served in Vietnam War and saw a lot of horror","p022","p031",2,2,3,2.6667
6462,34,264,18,"Person 1","I can't even imagine. Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p031",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
6463,34,264,19,"Person 2","Thank you, god bless, goodbye!","p022","p031",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1
6464,34,265,0,"Person 1","What did you think about this article?","p073","p020",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
6465,34,265,1,"Person 2","I was thinking how you hear about the war but not about the innocent citizens","p073","p020",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
6466,34,265,2,"Person 1","Yeah, it's really sad for them. And I never considered that people that had previously fled would then go back.","p073","p020",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6467,34,265,3,"Person 2","we are lucky that war is not happening in america","p073","p020",2.3333,0,2,2.3333
6468,34,265,4,"Person 1","I agree, I hope that is stays this way in America for many years also.","p073","p020",2,0,2.3333,2
6469,34,265,5,"Person 2","yes, it is a scary thought that is hard to imagine. Having to flee the country hoping another would accept you.","p073","p020",3,2,3,2.3333
6470,34,265,6,"Person 1","Can you imagine just leaving everything you have and going to another country where you might not even speak the language to start a new life? And what if you had children? I feel so badly for anyone in a situation like that.","p073","p020",3.6667,2,4.3333,2
6471,34,265,7,"Person 2","wow that is daunting. especially if you have no communication with you family. the possibilty of never seeing them again is very real","p073","p020",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
6472,34,265,8,"Person 1","I think those people must be very brave. But I guess it also depends on how bad the situation is that you are living in.","p073","p020",2,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
6473,34,265,9,"Person 2","that's true. it makes me happy to hear about people who are trying to help","p073","p020",2.3333,0,3,2.3333
6474,34,265,10,"Person 1","Yeah, it didn't seem from the article that they were getting much help though.","p073","p020",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6475,34,265,11,"Person 2","I always hear of organazations like doctors without borders who go into dangerous areas to help the citizens.","p073","p020",1,1,1.6667,2
6476,34,265,12,"Person 1","I agree, those organizations exist, I just can't remember reading anything in the article about any help or hope for those people. It sounded more like the countries that they had fled to weren't doing much for them and were encouraging them to return to Afghanistan.","p073","p020",1.6667,2,2.6667,2
6477,34,265,13,"Person 2","the fact that an entire country encourages people to go back to almost certain death is mind boggling","p073","p020",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
6478,34,265,14,"Person 1","I thought it also sounded like some people decided to go back on their own because they felt they could be more successful there even if they had to deal with the danger.","p073","p020",1,1.3333,3,2
6479,34,265,15,"Person 2","I wonder what is going through their head when they make that decision","p073","p020",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
6480,34,265,16,"Person 1","I can't imagine making that decision myself, but maybe they are just trying to survive and make a living.","p073","p020",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
6481,34,265,17,"Person 2","That is true. Many people who are immigrants in america work and send money back home to support their family. Maybe it's a situation like that.","p073","p020",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6482,34,265,18,"Person 1","It's been nice chatting with you!","p073","p020",1.6667,0,1,1
6483,34,265,19,"Person 2","I appreciate how kind you have been! I have really enjoyed this convo!","p073","p020",2.6667,0,1,2
6484,34,265,20,"Person 1","You too! bye","p073","p020",1.3333,0.3333,0.6667,1
6485,34,265,21,"Person 2","bye!","p073","p020",1,0.6667,0.6667,1
6486,47,266,0,"Person 1","I wonder if this war will ever end, doesn't seem like it's anywhere close to ending any time soon.","p058","p030",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
6487,47,266,1,"Person 2","Not as long as Russia is propping up Assad's regime.","p058","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
6488,47,266,2,"Person 1","Can you imagine getting a msg saying to leave in 24 hours or be bombed? Crazy.","p058","p030",3,2,3,2.3333
6489,47,266,3,"Person 2","No, I really can't. It's hard to believe so many people are surviving in what is essentially a war zone.","p058","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
6490,47,266,4,"Person 1","Can't blame them for wanting to leave and move to another country either.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
6491,47,266,5,"Person 2","The thing is, I don't think they necessarily WANT to leave. It's a choice between fleeing and dying.","p058","p030",2,1.3333,3,2.6667
6492,47,266,6,"Person 1","I feel like the US should just stay out of this conflict, I don't know if the so called moderate rebels are any better than assads regime","p058","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6493,47,266,7,"Person 2","It's Syria's problem, no the US's. Getting involved would only make things more complicated than they already are.","p058","p030",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
6494,47,266,8,"Person 1","It always seems like the US has to get involved in every other countries conflicts. Seems like it never ends.","p058","p030",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
6495,47,266,9,"Person 2","It's not that we always have to, it's that our country has global ambitions that can be furthered by taking sides in foreign conflict. The wealthy people in this country can't afford to leave well enough alone.","p058","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6496,47,266,10,"Person 1","what's your stance on taking in refugees from these war torn countries?","p058","p030",1,1,1,1
6497,47,266,11,"Person 2","I think it's the moral thing to do, but there should be infrastructure in place to acclimate refugees into western society after they have been granted asylum, quotas should be more realistic based on the resources available for this infrastructure and volunteers are absolutely necessary to help move the process along in a supportive capacity.","p058","p030",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
6498,47,266,12,"Person 1","I think that would be fair. I think every country needs to step up and help out in any way they can.","p058","p030",2,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6499,47,266,13,"Person 2","I think that is the only way that the problem will be addressed cooperatively. If every country is dealing with the same dilemma, people will be more likely to collaborate on a solution.","p058","p030",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6500,47,266,14,"Person 1","from what i have read about france and germany, taking in refugees has caused their crime rates to skyrocket","p058","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
6501,47,266,15,"Person 2","That's because there are no structures in place to acclimate the refugees as I had mentioned before. In the Middle East, rape is non-existent. You're putting people from an anachronistic ideological system who don't speak the language out into a culture that they are incapable of understanding. A transitional period is absolutely necessary for relocation on this scale to work.","p058","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6502,47,266,16,"Person 1","yeah, and any kind of infrastructure and programs to help them would cost quite a bit, i dont think many countries are willing to spend on that.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
6503,47,266,17,"Person 2","Especially after the situation has already been so embarrassingly mishandled. The distrust and prejudice against immigrants has already taken root.","p058","p030",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
6504,47,266,18,"Person 1","oh definitely, not to mention news media are almost covering up some of the crimes committed by refugees, the average population has no idea who to trust.","p058","p030",2,2,2,2.6667
6505,47,266,19,"Person 2","The entire world is in a sorry place regarding trust these day. Thanks for chatting! goodbye","p058","p030",2.6667,2,1,2.3333
6506,47,266,20,"Person 1","Thanks for the conversation. goodbye","p058","p030",1.3333,0.3333,1,1
6507,47,267,0,"Person 1","hello what did you think of the article?","p009","p024",1,1,0.6667,1
6508,47,267,1,"Person 2","i wonder how they managed to text everyone in eastern aleppo","p009","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
6509,47,267,2,"Person 1","im not sure, maybe some sort of automated system","p009","p024",1,1,1.6667,1
6510,47,267,3,"Person 2","yeah . what do you think about the whole situation","p009","p024",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
6511,47,267,4,"Person 1","I think it must be awful to live somewhere surrounded by war","p009","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
6512,47,267,5,"Person 2","we are very lucky to be living here","p009","p024",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,3
6513,47,267,6,"Person 1","i think so too, i feel sorry for the syrians","p009","p024",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
6514,47,267,7,"Person 2","what do you think should happen to them","p009","p024",1,1,1.3333,1.6667
6515,47,267,8,"Person 1","i think the US needs to stay out and stop making things worse","p009","p024",2.6667,2,2,2
6516,47,267,9,"Person 2","yeah we are always trying to be the world police","p009","p024",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
6517,47,267,10,"Person 1","it's stupid. Assad can handle things over there perfectly fine without us","p009","p024",3,2,1.6667,1.3333
6518,47,267,11,"Person 2","yeah i totally agree with that","p009","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
6519,47,267,12,"Person 1","i believe those gas attacks were faked in order to make him look bad","p009","p024",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
6520,47,267,13,"Person 2","someone is definitely doing things and make it seem like it was assad","p009","p024",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
6521,47,267,14,"Person 1","he would have had absolutely no reason to do that especially at that point in time, i'm very skeptical","p009","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6522,47,267,15,"Person 2","its like libya with gadaffi all over again","p009","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6523,47,267,16,"Person 1","yes exactly unfortunately","p009","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6524,47,267,17,"Person 2","we probably will never know who it is though that starts these things","p009","p024",1,1.6667,1.6667,2
6525,47,267,18,"Person 1","i think some of us may have a pretty good idea, lol","p009","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
6526,47,267,19,"Person 2","who do you think it is","p009","p024",1,1,1,1.6667
6527,47,267,20,"Person 1","i think there are powerful elites behind the scenes in a global sense","p009","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6528,47,267,21,"Person 2","i agree just didnt want to say lol","p009","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
6529,47,267,22,"Person 1","true lol, these things always point right back to them","p009","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
6530,47,267,23,"Person 2","i agree theres more than just this theyve done to the world","p009","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6531,47,267,24,"Person 1","yes definitely. for centuries lol","p009","p024",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
6532,47,267,25,"Person 2","its been a good talk bro. bye","p009","p024",1.3333,0,0.6667,1
6533,47,267,26,"Person 1","you too man, goodbye","p009","p024",1.3333,0,0.6667,1
6534,47,268,0,"Person 1","Syria is a real mess.","p062","p035",1.6667,2,2,1
6535,47,268,1,"Person 2","I agree, I would hate to get that text message!","p062","p035",3,2,2.6667,3
6536,47,268,2,"Person 1","Yes, that would be surreal and very frightening.  Interesting that it didn't get followed up by the bombing that was warned about.","p062","p035",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.3333
6537,47,268,3,"Person 2","I wouldn't be around, I would had to take them on their word.","p062","p035",1.3333,2,3,2
6538,47,268,4,"Person 1","For sure.  Civil wars are interesting.  Wars usually end faster when you fight them indiscriminatly, but in a civil war you don't want to completely destroy your own country.","p062","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6539,47,268,5,"Person 2","The stories about the leader gassing his own people. I do not know who is the bad guy in this story.","p062","p035",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.3333
6540,47,268,6,"Person 1","I think they're all bad.  That's part of the problem.  But with meat at $40 per kilogram, they're probably all pretty cranky.","p062","p035",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
6541,47,268,7,"Person 2","I can not afford $40 per kilogram of meat.","p062","p035",1,2,1.3333,2.3333
6542,47,268,8,"Person 1","I wonder who's even bringing that meat in in that situation.","p062","p035",1,1,2,1.6667
6543,47,268,9,"Person 2","and what kind of meat?","p062","p035",1,1,1.3333,1
6544,47,268,10,"Person 1","Yeah!  I hadn't thought of that.  Maybe it's just stray cats or something.  That would make more sense.","p062","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
6545,47,268,11,"Person 2","These emphatic conversation hits have made me a lot grateful for my life.","p062","p035",2,1,1.6667,3
6546,47,268,12,"Person 1","For sure.  I almost always say that to myself at some point during the article: \"We complain a lot in the West but man... it could be worse.\"","p062","p035",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2
6547,47,268,13,"Person 2","a lot worse and there is so many people in the world going through so many bad things","p062","p035",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
6548,47,268,14,"Person 1","Yeah, the amount of people uprooted and trying to find new countries is remarkable.  I suppose it makes some sense with our technology making the world smaller (seemingly, if nothing else).  But in the Middle East, Africa, Central america.   Just amazing the number of people trying to find a new home.","p062","p035",2.3333,2,2,1.6667
6549,47,268,15,"Person 2","It makes me mad when people say they could just stay in their own country. They just want a better life for their family. I do not have all the answers but I know we should have compassion for what they are going through","p062","p035",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
6550,47,268,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I agree.  But it's hard to know what the right answers are.  Like, I don't think we can just deal with the symptoms, which are refugees and that kind of thing.  That doesn't fix things in the long term.  But the real cause of these symptoms is stuff happening in sovereign countries, so we can't necessarily directly deal with them.","p062","p035",2.6667,2,2,2
6551,47,268,17,"Person 2","True, but look how worse we made Libya. It is a very complex problem. I just pray for everybody, us included","p062","p035",2,2,2,2.3333
6552,47,268,18,"Person 1","Yeah, I'd certainly like to see it get better for everyone, even if I have no idea how that'll happen.","p062","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6553,47,268,19,"Person 2","Yeah, I think we could afford to let a little more refugees in.","p062","p035",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
6554,47,268,20,"Person 1","Yeah, we could probably handle that.  Anyway, nice chatting with you today.  Have a good one.  bye","p062","p035",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
6555,47,268,21,"Person 2","Nice chatting with you too! bye","p062","p035",1.6667,0,0.6667,1.3333
6556,47,269,0,"Person 1","What a disturbing message to receive.","p030","p068",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
6557,47,269,1,"Person 2","exactly idk what i would do if that was me","p030","p068",2,2,2.6667,2.3333
6558,47,269,2,"Person 1","leave everything you've ever known and strike out on the road I guess? It amazes me that there are even still people living in Aleppo after eight years of this.","p030","p068",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
6559,47,269,3,"Person 2","Me two i have neighbors with family there it is so scary for them also","p030","p068",2.6667,2,2.3333,3
6560,47,269,4,"Person 1","Wow, have you ever talked to the about their feelings/desired resolution to the conflict?","p030","p068",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
6561,47,269,5,"Person 2","I try to just comfort them they are sad they cant go home anymore","p030","p068",1.6667,2,3.3333,3
6562,47,269,6,"Person 1","It must be heartbreaking. One of my best friends is from Iran and he can't go home because he'd be immediately conscripted for military service.","p030","p068",2.6667,2,2,2.6667
6563,47,269,7,"Person 2","wow really what does that mean ive never heard of that before?","p030","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
6564,47,269,8,"Person 1","military service is compulsory for all men of a certain age, so if he went back he would be forced into military service until he had fulfilled the required period of time. I think it's something like three years.","p030","p068",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
6565,47,269,9,"Person 2","oh wow so thankful to be living over here","p030","p068",2.3333,0,1,2.3333
6566,47,269,10,"Person 1","lot's of places have similar obligations for native citizens, like Norway and South Korea for example. Things are just a lot more dicey in the middle east.","p030","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
6567,47,269,11,"Person 2","yeah very true different governments and leaders controlling things","p030","p068",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
6568,47,269,12,"Person 1","Yep, ive heard stories of Norwegians expatriating of even committing suicide to not have to serve in the military.","p030","p068",1.6667,2,2,2
6569,47,269,13,"Person 2","omg really i didnt now even norwegians had to do that i thought just places like north korea","p030","p068",2,1.6667,2,2
6570,47,269,14,"Person 1","it's a relatively wide spread practice that definitely messes with people who are pacifists. That's what's so sad about the situation in Syria. A lot of the people are civilians who are just caught in the crossfire of larger nation's political agendas.","p030","p068",1,2,2.6667,1
6571,47,269,15,"Person 2","Very true innocent people are being killed and scared to just live thre life day to day","p030","p068",2,2,3.3333,1.3333
6572,47,269,16,"Person 1","How much longer do you think the fighting will drag on now that the U.S. is pulling out and allowing Turkey to advance?","p030","p068",1,1.3333,1.6667,1
6573,47,269,17,"Person 2","I think it will drag on i dont see an end in sigh","p030","p068",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
6574,47,269,18,"Person 1","Me either, unfortunately. Well, thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p068",1.6667,2,2,1.6667
6575,47,269,19,"Person 2","you two bye!","p030","p068",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,1
6576,47,270,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article","p022","p048",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
6577,47,270,1,"Person 2","It wasn't a very pleasant read. I can definitely empathize with those people.","p022","p048",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6578,47,270,2,"Person 1","It's terrible what they have to go through on a daily basis","p022","p048",3,2,3.3333,2
6579,47,270,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I can't even imagine if that happened in America","p022","p048",2.6667,2,3,2
6580,47,270,4,"Person 1","Me neither. Imagine always having to run away from something.. even when you did nothing wrong","p022","p048",2,2,4,2
6581,47,270,5,"Person 2","Exactly. It's not a good situation. But it could happen anywhere in all reality","p022","p048",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
6582,47,270,6,"Person 1","Yeah that's true just not to that extent. wish there was something we could do to help","p022","p048",1.6667,2,2,2
6583,47,270,7,"Person 2","Yeah, not much that can be done. Especially in these small countries that we don't hear about for months after the fact.","p022","p048",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
6584,47,270,8,"Person 1","I feel very fortunate after reading that article","p022","p048",3,0,1.3333,2.3333
6585,47,270,9,"Person 2","Yes, anyone in America should. Things like this seem to happen everywhere but there are still crap things that happen here too but just not to the extreme.","p022","p048",2,1.3333,2.3333,2
6586,47,270,10,"Person 1","True, we have our own issues but at least our lives aren't at stake. Well except for shootings","p022","p048",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
6587,47,270,11,"Person 2","Well yes but even shootings occur in other countries on our level and we just hardly hear about them. It's crazy how much stuff we don't realize.","p022","p048",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6588,47,270,12,"Person 1","Yeah everyone's too busy with their lives to really dig into all of this!","p022","p048",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333
6589,47,270,13,"Person 2","Yes exactly. They'd rather just put blame on other people and get on with their lives.","p022","p048",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
6590,47,270,14,"Person 1","I guess i can be guilty of this at times but there is nothing you can really do. Just emphatize and move on","p022","p048",2.6667,2,1.3333,2.6667
6591,47,270,15,"Person 2","Exactly. It's sad that we can't do much but everyone has their own worries to worry about. Not saying their own worries are more important, but sometimes they are.","p022","p048",3,2,1.6667,2
6592,47,270,16,"Person 1","Yup i agree. Do you think the future will be better for those people in that country?","p022","p048",2,1,2,1.6667
6593,47,270,17,"Person 2","One can only hope but at the same time, probably not.","p022","p048",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6594,47,270,18,"Person 1","Yeah, let's pray for them! It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p048",3,0,2,2
6595,47,270,19,"Person 2","Exactly. goodbye.","p022","p048",1,1,1,1
6596,146,271,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about the president's outspoken disdain for specific demographics?","p030","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
6597,146,271,1,"Person 2","I think it is very wrong and hurts the country and you?","p030","p035",3,2,3.6667,2.6667
6598,146,271,2,"Person 1","I think it's effective for galvanizing his base, most of whom don't pay attention to politics in any meaningful way. It's a dirty way to  play, but i'd expect nothing less from him.","p030","p035",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
6599,146,271,3,"Person 2","Sadly, I do think is he is too different for most American presidents, but they were smart enough no to say it out loud.","p030","p035",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
6600,146,271,4,"Person 1","Therein lies the difference. He has made outspoken racists/nationalists/fascists comfortable enough to go out and steal/murder/rape and know that others like them will celebrate their actions.","p030","p035",4,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
6601,146,271,5,"Person 2","There is a direct link between him and a lot of the mass shooting lately.","p030","p035",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
6602,146,271,6,"Person 1","Yeah, and I work in juvenile justice. These mass shooters often make a comfortable living, get married and are celebrated in prison. It's literally a career path for hateful alienated people and it's disgusting.","p030","p035",4,2,3.3333,3
6603,146,271,7,"Person 2","I wish I had an answer for hate, some people just are irrational","p030","p035",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
6604,146,271,8,"Person 1","I think the reality that most people are *extremely online* plays a big role in this kind of thing manifesting itself. Online communities are predominately just people patting each other on the back for their behaviors and beliefs.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6605,146,271,9,"Person 2","There are a lot of sad and lonely people looking for a group to join. I use they could just find one that is not hate focused.","p030","p035",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6606,146,271,10,"Person 1","They probably could if they tried to find an actual group of people and not just a collection of avatars online.","p030","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
6607,146,271,11,"Person 2","Do you see the shooting slowing down?","p030","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
6608,146,271,12,"Person 1","Pardon?","p030","p035",1,1,0.6667,1.3333
6609,146,271,13,"Person 2","Do you think the hate crimes/mass shooting are going to slow down?","p030","p035",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
6610,146,271,14,"Person 1","Why would they? Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is as prevalent as ever and no action is being taken to keep dangerous people from acquiring firearms. Do you?","p030","p035",4,2,2.6667,2.6667
6611,146,271,15,"Person 2","I see them speeding up.","p030","p035",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
6612,146,271,16,"Person 1","It's definitely a possibility. With the coming recession tensions are only going to run higher.","p030","p035",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
6613,146,271,17,"Person 2","Do you think Trump will be reelected?","p030","p035",1,1,1,1.6667
6614,146,271,18,"Person 1","I think it is a distinct possibility. The whole thing is going to be hard to watch regardless of the outcome.","p030","p035",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
6615,146,271,19,"Person 2","I agree. It was nice chatting with you! bye","p030","p035",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
6616,146,271,20,"Person 1","Back at you. bye","p030","p035",1.6667,0.3333,1,1.3333
6617,146,272,0,"Person 1","I found this article obnoxious.  What were your thoughts on it?","p029","p062",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
6618,146,272,1,"Person 2","Obnoxious in what sense?","p029","p062",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
6619,146,272,2,"Person 1","It attempted to blame an increase in hate crimes (which it later retracted, saying they were likely at the same level as they were in 2015) on Trump.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
6620,146,272,3,"Person 2","Yeah, but the media's pretty good at that, aren't they?  I don't think Trump creates anger and hatred.  He might embolden it.  Maybe.  But it already exists and is a function of our society, not one man.","p029","p062",2,1.3333,1,2.3333
6621,146,272,4,"Person 1","Those are my exact sentiments.  It is a mindset that has entered society and is probably exacerbated by social media and the rapid exchange of information, ideas, hatred, and anger that is prevalent in society today.  To blame it on Trump, one person, is just absurd.","p029","p062",3,2,1,2
6622,146,272,5,"Person 2","I also sympathize fully with people who are furious after terrorist attacks.  I personally wouldn't go harass or assault an innocent person because of it, but I understand the feelings behind it, even if I don't condone the behavior.","p029","p062",3,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
6623,146,272,6,"Person 1","Yes, and there have been a large number of terrorist incidents that were perpetrated by Muslims.  So to me, that would explain why people are targeting Muslims in retaliation.  Which is not right at all, but it is the explanation for why that is happening.","p029","p062",3,1,1.3333,1.6667
6624,146,272,7,"Person 2","I guess I also feel that the notion of everyone living together peacefully and harmoniously is misguided.  There will always be winners and losers, always be some sort of \"us versus them.\"  You see it in gender issues, race issues, political issues.  I think certain majority elements in our society are waking up to this and pushing back.  And I don't blame them.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6625,146,272,8,"Person 1","You make a good point.  That is probably an idealistic notion that is not grounded in reality.  I do wish people would learn to live and let live a little bit more.  Just mind their own business and enjoy their lives.","p029","p062",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2
6626,146,272,9,"Person 2","Yes, I don't want to present too cynical and callous a view.  People can form stable societies.  But our current one likes to highlight differences and perceived inequalities, and that feeds a very antagonistic culture.  I think we know too much about each other, see too much that other people have that we don't, and it creates unrealistic expectations about how the world can possibly work.  We don't all get to have what we want.  Few, or none, do","p029","p062",3,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6627,146,272,10,"Person 1","Yes and social media probably feeds into that.  Not to keep blaming social media for all our problems because I certainly don't think that's the case, but I Do think it heightens the issue you are describing.  People see differences and inequalities and just have much more information than they did in the past.","p029","p062",3,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
6628,146,272,11,"Person 2","Yeah, don't feel bad about ripping on social media.  I think it's a real problem.  Or, as you say, it heightens all these problems.  I think it's a real problem and will be interested to see how things unfold going forward, whether people start turning away from it or they double down and more of our lives gets filtered through our screens.  The problem is it's addictive for people, among other things, and I think that makes it harder for people to decide not to use it, even when they know it makes them unhappy.","p029","p062",3,2,1.3333,2
6629,146,272,12,"Person 1","Yeah it definitely becomes compulsive for people, like an integrated and critical part of their lives almost.  Something did not really happen unless it's documented on social media.  Kinda crazy to me, but whatever.  Either way, I do think it is intensifying a lot of these problems and it will definitely be interesting to see what happens over the next century.","p029","p062",3,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
6630,146,272,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I thought about that once.  Think about how much our minds now associated \"importance\" with seeing it on a screen.  We've been conditioned to think that way.  And I think it works the other way, too.  When we see something, we make it important by recording it.  A strange phenomenon, that something isn't important until it's digitized.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
6631,146,272,14,"Person 1","It is a very strange phenomenon.  And it has happened so fast.  It's crazy to think when I was a kid the only phones we had were in the house, and the computer was basically just a very simple word processor.  My kids can't even fathom it.  We used a phone book to look up a phone number.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.3333,1,3
6632,146,272,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I was the same.  I don't even have a cell phone myself.  I'm annoyed that so few people are now in the phone book.  Some places apparently don't even have phone books anymore.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,3
6633,146,272,16,"Person 1","Yeah I don't even know where I would get a phone book.  They don't distribute them where I live.  I have a cell phone but it stays off on a shelf unless I leave the house.  It is for emergency use when I am out.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
6634,146,272,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I don't ever judge people for having a cell phone.  I just joke that \"I'm not that important,\" which has more meaning than I let on, but I mostly mean as a joke.","p029","p062",2,1,1.6667,2.6667
6635,146,272,18,"Person 1","LOL apparently I am not either.  But I am perfectly fine with that.  This is how I choose to live my life.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye","p029","p062",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
6636,146,272,19,"Person 2","For sure, great chatting with you.  I enjoyed it and appreciate your perspective.  Have a great day.  bye","p029","p062",2,0,1.3333,2
6637,146,273,0,"Person 1","How did you feel about the article?","p024","p028",0.6667,1.3333,0.3333,1.3333
6638,146,273,1,"Person 2","I felt pretty bad reading it, with all the issues going on in the country right now i had never even though of how bad things must be for Muslims living in America","p024","p028",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
6639,146,273,2,"Person 1","Yeah I never heard about the rise in hate crimes against them until now.","p024","p028",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
6640,146,273,3,"Person 2","I knew obviously that there was a big rise after 9/11 happened but that the number is reaching a high once again is alarming. Makes you wonder why it is never reported on.","p024","p028",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
6641,146,273,4,"Person 1","what do you think is causing it now?","p024","p028",1,1,0.6667,1
6642,146,273,5,"Person 2","I think the the current debate over immigration has a lot of people feeling a very us vs them mentality as of late. People are only seeing race right now and using that to decide american or not american.","p024","p028",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
6643,146,273,6,"Person 1","yeah that's probably it. the presidents choice of words also arent always the best","p024","p028",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
6644,146,273,7,"Person 2","Definitely not helping matters at all. I really hope that this is the worst things will get and over time things start to improve for all Races in the US.","p024","p028",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
6645,146,273,8,"Person 1","maybe in the future we will all get along","p024","p028",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333
6646,146,273,9,"Person 2","Yeah maybe, But i feel like minorities were feeling the same way 50 or 60 years ago which makes me sort of discouraged","p024","p028",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
6647,146,273,10,"Person 1","Reading over the article it does seem like its a problem that has been going on for a long time","p024","p028",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
6648,146,273,11,"Person 2","Well Yeah the crimes has only been spiking lately but the crimes are only a symptom of race relations in the country right? Or at least thats how i see it.","p024","p028",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
6649,146,273,12,"Person 1","yeah its hard to pin what the root of the cause is","p024","p028",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
6650,146,273,13,"Person 2","Definitely, what do you think could be done to maybe calm the racial tensions?","p024","p028",1.3333,1,1,1.6667
6651,146,273,14,"Person 1","probably more programs that bond people together. Educate people on these things. i honestly have no idea. what do you think can be done?","p024","p028",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
6652,146,273,15,"Person 2","Yeah that could be really helpful, and i think start with kids maybe. Educate them on accepting others and seeing others as equal and hope that things change over time. I'm not to sure really.","p024","p028",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
6653,146,273,16,"Person 1","definitely kids are like sponges and take in what their parents teach them or anyone around them. if theyre educated in time it can be prevented","p024","p028",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
6654,146,273,17,"Person 2","Yeah for sure need to make sure that the bad ideals are not passed on. Also maybe the kids will end up teaching their parents something too.","p024","p028",2,0,1.3333,2
6655,146,273,18,"Person 1","I agree it all starts at home with the parents.","p024","p028",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2
6656,146,273,19,"Person 2","Whatever the solution is hopefully it is found soon.","p024","p028",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
6657,146,273,20,"Person 1","i definitely agree on all points. its been a good talk. bye","p024","p028",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.6667
6658,146,273,21,"Person 2","Yeah been a nice conversation. bye","p024","p028",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
6659,146,274,0,"Person 1","hi, what did you think of the article?","p009","p058",1,1,0.6667,1
6660,146,274,1,"Person 2","I thought it was interesting, I had a hard time connecting with it though. What about you? What did you think?","p009","p058",2,1,1.6667,2
6661,146,274,2,"Person 1","I think it is very one sided","p009","p058",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
6662,146,274,3,"Person 2","Oh yeah? In what way?","p009","p058",1,1,0.6667,1
6663,146,274,4,"Person 1","I think they are neglecting to address what is causing this response","p009","p058",1,2,1.6667,1.6667
6664,146,274,5,"Person 2","Hmm, yeah I see what you mean, articles like this just leave me feeling like there isn't much that can be done","p009","p058",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6665,146,274,6,"Person 1","Yeah I feel that way too. Wish all people could get along","p009","p058",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
6666,146,274,7,"Person 2","Yeah, it just doesn't seem like it will ever really happen.","p009","p058",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
6667,146,274,8,"Person 1","do you think its just nature?","p009","p058",1,1,1,1
6668,146,274,9,"Person 2","it could be, but who really knows","p009","p058",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
6669,146,274,10,"Person 1","do you think it would be better if people separated themselves into their preferred groups?","p009","p058",1,1,1.3333,1
6670,146,274,11,"Person 2","i think it might help, but will that overcome human nature? I mean, honestly, I just don't know. what do you think?","p009","p058",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6671,146,274,12,"Person 1","I think maybe if people were separated and kept to themselves they may get along better. they could still trade and communicate and all of that, but just live in their own spaces","p009","p058",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2.3333
6672,146,274,13,"Person 2","it's a shame we cant just get along and work together, need to be separated like rowdy children on the playground","p009","p058",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6673,146,274,14,"Person 1","I agree but I suppose desperate times...","p009","p058",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6674,146,274,15,"Person 2","yeah thats true, gotta do what you gotta do","p009","p058",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
6675,146,274,16,"Person 1","i just wish there was more of a sense of community","p009","p058",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6676,146,274,17,"Person 2","yeah i agree, its like reading articles like this just brings me down, i wonder if thats why things like this fly under the radar as people tune it out because of so much negativity in the world","p009","p058",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6677,146,274,18,"Person 1","yeah i think people are becoming desensitized to everything","p009","p058",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
6678,146,274,19,"Person 2","yeah and its causing all kinds of problems, people would rather just tune it out and act like nothing is happening, ignorance is bliss i suppose","p009","p058",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
6679,146,274,20,"Person 1","good talking to you, goodbye","p009","p058",1.3333,0,1.3333,1
6680,146,274,21,"Person 2","nice talking to you too, goodbye","p009","p058",1.3333,0,1.3333,1
6681,146,275,0,"Person 1","hello what did you think about the article","p022","p024",1,1,0.6667,1
6682,146,275,1,"Person 2","i think its wrong to attack people for having a certain religion","p022","p024",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
6683,146,275,2,"Person 1","It's terrible. They are getting so stereotyped","p022","p024",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
6684,146,275,3,"Person 2","what do you think can be done","p022","p024",1.6667,1,1,1
6685,146,275,4,"Person 1","I don't think anything can be done. We just have to wait because i think children growing up now are more open and understanding to others","p022","p024",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
6686,146,275,5,"Person 2","yeah it starts at home with parenting","p022","p024",2,1,2,1.6667
6687,146,275,6,"Person 1","I agree. Have you ever experienced anything like that? discrimination?","p022","p024",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
6688,146,275,7,"Person 2","I feel like I have more than a few times, what about you?","p022","p024",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
6689,146,275,8,"Person 1","I have never fortunately. I would be very angry though if it were to happen","p022","p024",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
6690,146,275,9,"Person 2","yeah i probably would know not to react badly though because its what they would want me to do","p022","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
6691,146,275,10,"Person 1","That is very true and mature of you. What do you think of Muslim people?","p022","p024",2,0.3333,2,1.3333
6692,146,275,11,"Person 2","I haven't really had experiences with them so I can't really say. What about you?","p022","p024",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
6693,146,275,12,"Person 1","No bad experienced here either. I definitely wouuldn't be scared or anything though if i saw one","p022","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6694,146,275,13,"Person 2","yeah I feel like the bad ones ruing it for the majority","p022","p024",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
6695,146,275,14,"Person 1","Definitely. I feel like that's the same thing for any race","p022","p024",2,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6696,146,275,15,"Person 2","yeah every race or religion or group in general has bad people in it.","p022","p024",2,1,2.3333,1.3333
6697,146,275,16,"Person 1","Hopefully Muslims have a better future","p022","p024",2,0,2.6667,1
6698,146,275,17,"Person 2","yeah hope so","p022","p024",2,0.3333,1.3333,1
6699,146,275,18,"Person 1","it was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p024",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
6700,146,275,19,"Person 2","bye","p022","p024",1.3333,1,1,1
6701,370,276,0,"Person 1","Wow, this story really makes me appreciate the little things.","p073","p064",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.3333
6702,370,276,1,"Person 2","Seriously, its so sad that these poor kids are denied food.\\","p073","p064",2,0,2.3333,2.6667
6703,370,276,2,"Person 1","Yeah, and no matter how good of intentions the parents may have, they are just stuck in a terrible situation.","p073","p064",2.6667,2,3,2
6704,370,276,3,"Person 2","Exactly, I know about 30% of the kids in my son's school are provided lunch and breakfast for almost free by the government and its not the fault of the parents its just how it goes sometimes","p073","p064",2,1,2,3
6705,370,276,4,"Person 1","But even if that was the case there, the kids aren't even able to get to school sometimes because they have to go stand in food lines to get food for the entire family. It's a vicious circle because they are being kept out of school so they are not getting the education that they need to eventually be able to have a better life.","p073","p064",2.3333,2,3,2
6706,370,276,5,"Person 2","Yea its sad the government doesn't recognize that the children are the future and they should be provided food so that they go to school","p073","p064",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
6707,370,276,6,"Person 1","It is all just really sad, obviously everyone there must be very hungry. I would think most people would try make sure their kids were getting food before they ate it themselves.","p073","p064",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
6708,370,276,7,"Person 2","Yea the parents probably have trouble working since they are starving as well, and that probably makes it even harder to provide for their family","p073","p064",2,2,2,2.3333
6709,370,276,8,"Person 1","It makes me so sad, sometimes I think I wish I could just send money to people like this but I don't really know how or if I trust organizations. What my family spends on one meal eating out would probably be life changing for people like this.","p073","p064",2.3333,2,2.6667,3.3333
6710,370,276,9,"Person 2","Exactly, I think its basically impossible for people to reach out to people like this because the government is so untrustworthy","p073","p064",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
6712,370,276,11,"Person 2","I am sure very rich people have looked into helping but I don't think anybody can help them","p073","p064",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
6713,370,276,12,"Person 1","I just can't imagine living somewhere like that and trying to raise my children and give them the life they deserve.","p073","p064",2.3333,2,2,3
6714,370,276,13,"Person 2","Me neither, I have 2 kids and they get everything they want/need... I couldn't imagine it any other way","p073","p064",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
6715,370,276,14,"Person 1","Same here, but even sometimes I wonder \"Have I given them everything they need?\"","p073","p064",1.6667,1.6667,2,3
6716,370,276,15,"Person 2","Exactly, I think that all the time and its about dumb stuff like shoes and pokemon cards. It makes me really appreciate what we have in this country","p073","p064",2,0.6667,2,3
6717,370,276,16,"Person 1","Yes, this story definitely makes you realize how good we have it.","p073","p064",2,0,2.3333,2.3333
6718,370,276,17,"Person 2","I've been doing these Empathic Conversation HITS for the last 2 or 3 weeks and its so sad how people in other countries are living and I do not think many americans are aware of it","p073","p064",2,2,2,3.3333
6719,370,276,18,"Person 1","You're so right, these hits make me so sad all of the time. And if you watch our news, sometimes it seems like they are saying that our country is so terrible. If people paid more attention to what is actually happening all over the world, maybe they would realize how good we have it.","p073","p064",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6720,370,276,19,"Person 2","Yea the only think I see on the news is about politics and its so annoying, nobody is aware of the world we live in and apparently neither am I because I didn't know about these issues until I started doing these HITS","p073","p064",2.3333,2,1.6667,3
6721,370,276,20,"Person 1","Yeah, you really have to go outside of the mainstream media to find much that is just about our country and our politics. I love watching documentaries on different cultures and issues occurring around the world.","p073","p064",2.3333,0.3333,1.6667,3.6667
6722,370,276,21,"Person 2","I do too, its very interesting","p073","p064",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
6723,370,276,22,"Person 1","It's been great talking to you!","p073","p064",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667
6724,370,276,23,"Person 2","Same! bye","p073","p064",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
6725,370,276,24,"Person 1","bye","p073","p064",1,1,0.6667,1
6726,370,277,0,"Person 1","Not lookin' good in Venezuela!","p062","p035",2.6667,2,1,1
6727,370,277,1,"Person 2","I agree. I still feel sorry for the children and their families.","p062","p035",2,2,2,2
6728,370,277,2,"Person 1","Right, I feel for them too.  Venezuela is a very wealthy nation because of its oil reserves, and yet its people are starving because of dictatorial corruption.  What can you say.","p062","p035",3,2,2,2
6729,370,277,3,"Person 2","Working five months for 17 dollars, WOW!","p062","p035",3,2,2,1
6730,370,277,4,"Person 1","Yeah, that's wild.  And what was the number they said for what they're spending on school lunches/  $0.0007 per lunch of something stupid.","p062","p035",3,2,1.3333,1.3333
6731,370,277,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm surprised they haven't had a revolt.","p062","p035",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
6732,370,277,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  At what point is there real revolution?  Better to get killed fighting to live than just to expire.  But I don't know what all is going on, and I know millions have already fled.","p062","p035",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.3333
6733,370,277,7,"Person 2","It was a whole lot easier to have a revolution before guns. Now if you storm the castle your going to get shot.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
6734,370,277,8,"Person 1","True, although we had a revolution with guns, too.  I also think there's probably a different mindset in a communist country.  Those people have been dependent on their government; it's very counterintuitive to fight against the hand that's fed you.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
6735,370,277,9,"Person 2","We didn't have a revolution with modern guns. None of those guns could have sniped George off the boat at night with a scope. They are in a lose-lose situation","p062","p035",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
6736,370,277,10,"Person 1","I guess, but again, what's the difference between starving to death and getting shot?  At what point do you try to take control of your own situation?","p062","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
6737,370,277,11,"Person 2","I agree I rather die fighting, but I hope I never have to make that choice.","p062","p035",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
6738,370,277,12,"Person 1","Agreed, and I'm pretty sure we won't.  Or if we do, it certainly won't be because of the same causes as they are in Venezuela.","p062","p035",2,1,2,1.3333
6739,370,277,13,"Person 2","America is not far off the have and the have nots, but our standard of not having nothing is a lot better than how some people are living in the world.","p062","p035",2,1,1.3333,1.6667
6740,370,277,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I think there's a big difference between having one meal per day that requires standing in food lines, and not being able to afford the smartphone you want.","p062","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
6741,370,277,15,"Person 2","I wouldn't know how to tell my children that we are not eating today.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3
6742,370,277,16,"Person 1","Yeah.  I also wondered how long these families keep sending their kids to school at all.  At what point is mere survival more important.","p062","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
6743,370,277,17,"Person 2","Yeah, there is no point of learning if you can not even feed yourself.","p062","p035",2,2,2,1.3333
6744,370,277,18,"Person 1","Oh well, hopefully this gets better.  And at some point I guess it will.  I'm not sure how it looks when it does, but oppression and tyranny don't last forever.","p062","p035",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
6745,370,277,19,"Person 2","I bet if feels like a life time for the people that it is happening to.","p062","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
6746,370,277,20,"Person 1","Yeah, I imagine every day is a lifetime.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good day.  bye","p062","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
6747,370,277,21,"Person 2","Nice chatting with you too! bye","p062","p035",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
6748,370,278,0,"Person 1","Hey how are you doing? What did you think about the article?","p048","p035",1,1,1,1
6749,370,278,1,"Person 2","I\"m good and you? The article is sad.","p048","p035",2,1.3333,2,2
6750,370,278,2,"Person 1","I'm good. Yeah the article is sad. You don't really realize that a lot of countries still really struggle with hungry children.","p048","p035",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
6751,370,278,3,"Person 2","Yeah, It makes me think about how much food my family waste.","p048","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
6752,370,278,4,"Person 1","Yes! Oh man, exactly. I feel like in America it's so easy just to throw away something because it's \"expired\" but really any one in any other country would still use those products.","p048","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
6753,370,278,5,"Person 2","My children are so picky of what they will eat or won't eat, but it is hard for them to understand how other children in the world are feeling.","p048","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
6754,370,278,6,"Person 1","Yeah, that is a really tough concept to teach to kids. I'm lucky that mine are young enough to not know any different","p048","p035",2.3333,0.3333,3,2
6755,370,278,7,"Person 2","Do you feel like it is their government's fault?","p048","p035",1,1,1,1
6756,370,278,8,"Person 1","I think government definitely has some influence on it but I'm not one to put the blame on something even when it's needed. Although it sounds like the government over there isn't ran very well.","p048","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
6757,370,278,9,"Person 2","Yeah, I thought they had a lot of oil money in the country.","p048","p035",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
6758,370,278,10,"Person 1","Yeah, it seems like they don't allocate the money properly. I feel like here in the US they have more and more programs for kids in schools to get food even when they aren't at school.","p048","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
6759,370,278,11,"Person 2","I agree. No child should go hungry. Like you said there are a lot of countries out there with a lot of hungry children. It is sad to think about.","p048","p035",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
6760,370,278,12,"Person 1","It really is. I feel like we don't even realize how many countries actually struggle. But at the end of the day, how can we know for sure that the money or organizations we donate to are using the money properly? It's hard.","p048","p035",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
6761,370,278,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I heard some bad things about some of the charities doing relief aid.","p048","p035",1.3333,2,2,1.6667
6762,370,278,14,"Person 1","Yes, so have I. It's crazy what people do with money that should be going to something to help children.","p048","p035",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
6763,370,278,15,"Person 2","Greed is a horrible thing. I couldn't sleep at night if I did that to children.","p048","p035",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
6764,370,278,16,"Person 1","Most definitely. It breaks your hear that some people will do anything for money. I am so minimalist that I would rather live with what's on my back than have anything extra.","p048","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
6765,370,278,17,"Person 2","I sometimes wonder how far have we gotten away from loving life without having to have a lot of unnecessary things.","p048","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
6766,370,278,18,"Person 1","Yes. It's a materialistic world these days. I wonder how different it may be in these other countries. I would love to travel and see it first hand because you'd really be able to emphasize with them more.","p048","p035",2,1,2,1.6667
6767,370,278,19,"Person 2","I agree. Technology is a good and bad thing. I think we are more detached now days.","p048","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
6768,370,278,20,"Person 1","Very much so. It really is a blessing and a curse. I really think that some aspects have improved from technology but our interactions with others have decreased.","p048","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
6769,370,278,21,"Person 2","Would you donate more if you knew 100 percent went to the people that needed it. I would.","p048","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
6770,370,278,22,"Person 1","Yes oh yeah. I don't trust organizations enough currently.","p048","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
6771,370,278,23,"Person 2","Plus a lot of them have a lot of overhead.","p048","p035",1.3333,1.6667,2,1
6772,370,278,24,"Person 1","Exactly. They have to get paid too so where does that money come from?","p048","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
6773,370,278,25,"Person 2","I also thing is it better to set up systems to improve peoples life not  only just give them food or money.","p048","p035",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
6774,370,278,26,"Person 1","Yes yes yes. Because even if you were to give them money or food, the issue will repeat again and again. Especially if there is corruption with the government in those places.","p048","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
6775,370,278,27,"Person 2","I would like to travel to different countries like you said. See things first hand.","p048","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
6776,370,278,28,"Person 1","Yes. I think also going to those places and helping first hand is more helpful too.","p048","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
6777,370,278,29,"Person 2","Do you have any other thoughts about the article?","p048","p035",1,1,0.6667,1
6778,370,278,30,"Person 1","Not specifically. It was a pleasure speaking with you","p048","p035",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
6779,370,278,31,"Person 2","You TOO! goodbye","p048","p035",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
6780,370,278,32,"Person 1","goodbye","p048","p035",1,1,0.6667,1
6781,370,279,0,"Person 1","This was one of the saddest stories I have read so far.","p030","p029",3.6667,2,3,2
6782,370,279,1,"Person 2","yeah me too.  Really heartbreaking, all these kids suffering.  And their parents feeling helpless","p030","p029",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
6783,370,279,2,"Person 1","Just picturing these poor little kids being so hungry they literally can't even stay awake. Goodness. I wonder how widespread the problem really is.","p030","p029",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
6784,370,279,3,"Person 2","yeah I bet it is bad.  I read another article on here about how animals at the Venezuelan zoo were starving to death, and people were slaughtering horses to eat and to feed animals.  It's really bad down there.","p030","p029",4,2,3.3333,1.6667
6785,370,279,4,"Person 1","I actually read that article too. I'm sure that the government is using plenty of resources to make sure only a fraction of what is going on down there is actually reported on.","p030","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
6786,370,279,5,"Person 2","yeah no doubt.  I think their economy is one of the worst in the world, and they have an extreme political situation, too.  Isn't it some sort of horrible dictatorship?","p030","p029",3,2,2.3333,1.3333
6787,370,279,6,"Person 1","Yeah, maduro is clinging to power because of being propped up by Cuban and Russian interests.","p030","p029",2,1.6667,2,1
6788,370,279,7,"Person 2","yeah I am not informed about all that, I just know their situation is dire.","p030","p029",2,2,2.3333,1.3333
6789,370,279,8,"Person 1","I know that there's hyper-inflation and therefore a growing preference for crypto-currencies and that the military is making quite a bit of money by transporting cheaply bought Venezuelan gasoline to neighboring countries and selling it at an incredible profit. Then, you have the people fleeing the country only to end up in more compromising positions, but beyond that I'm pretty uninformed as well.","p030","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
6790,370,279,9,"Person 2","I just remember learning in Economics class in graduate school that they had a serious hyper-inflation issue, to the extent that they were paying the workers several times a day bc their checks would be worthless by the end of the day otherwise.  that way they could take money home to the wives andt hey could go buy food.  ridiculous.  apparently not much has changed.","p030","p029",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6791,370,279,10,"Person 1","well, and according to the article they have the iconic \"bread lines\" where people have to line up at a specific time just to have a chance at purchasing bare necessities.","p030","p029",3,2,1.6667,1
6792,370,279,11,"Person 2","that's so crazy to try to wrap my head around.  I am SO grateful to be an American, seriously.","p030","p029",4,0.6667,2,2.6667
6793,370,279,12,"Person 1","Yeah, I get annoyed by not having some ingredient that is essential to a recipe and having to run to the store, but at least there's a store to go to and food to be had. It's wild how jaded you become living such a priviliged life.","p030","p029",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6794,370,279,13,"Person 2","yeah no doubt!  Outraged when they are out of the english muffins I like.","p030","p029",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
6795,370,279,14,"Person 1","The vast majority of Americans probably don't even know what intense hunger feels like, but it's a daily reality for these poor kids.","p030","p029",2.6667,2,2,1.3333
6796,370,279,15,"Person 2","yeah I try to remind my kids that when they say they are \"starving\" but I know they can't even fathom what I'm talking about","p030","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6797,370,279,16,"Person 1","and the article mentioned that with such poor nutrition the children can't even retain any of the information their supposed to be learning.","p030","p029",2.6667,2,1.3333,1
6798,370,279,17,"Person 2","yeah, which is understandable.  How can you learn if you're literally starving?  so sad.","p030","p029",3,2,2.3333,1.6667
6799,370,279,18,"Person 1","no kidding. well, thanks for chatting with me today! bye","p030","p029",2,0.3333,2,1.3333

6815,370,280,14,"Person 1","i wonder that too","p024","p068",2,1,1.6667,1.3333
6816,370,280,15,"Person 2","they need to have the government step in and help","p024","p068",2,0.6667,2,1.6667

6830,202,281,5,"Person 2","I feel that people should have the right to kill their self, it is their body and their life, but killing other people because your sad makes you a coward.","p009","p035",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333

6849,202,282,0,"Person 1","How'd it make you feel? :(","p016","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1
6850,202,282,1,"Person 2","I felt sad but at the same time angry at the man. What about you?","p016","p022",3.3333,2,4,2.6667
6851,202,282,2,"Person 1","Just. So angry, honestly. What a terrible way to die.","p016","p022",4,2,4,2.6667
6852,202,282,3,"Person 2","It's terrible too because how can you kill your own children?!","p016","p022",3.6667,2,4.3333,2
6853,202,282,4,"Person 1","I just—jeez. I wish he hadn't have been able to get a gun if he was that unstable.","p016","p022",3,2,3.6667,2
6854,202,282,5,"Person 2","Yeah, exactly! I don't think the article mentioned it but i wonder what was the purpose","p016","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
6855,202,282,6,"Person 1","I mean, I don't remember where he lived, but in a lot of places in the US it's just normal to have one","p016","p022",1.6667,1,2,1
6856,202,282,7,"Person 2","Oh no i mean what the purpose of killing his sons were. I do agree though that he shouldn't have a gun!","p016","p022",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
6857,202,282,8,"Person 1","Oh, gotcha. I feel like that happens sometimes, especially when it's the dad that's suicidal.","p016","p022",1.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
6858,202,282,9,"Person 2","I just wouldn't understand the thought of killing your own children as well. Of course, i will never be able to understand but still! It feel bad for the mother... wonder what happened with her","p016","p022",2.6667,2,3.6667,3
6859,202,282,10,"Person 1","Yeah, I can't even imagine coming home to that. :(","p016","p022",3,2,3,1.6667
6860,202,282,11,"Person 2","Yeah.. do you think that people with severe mental illness should be allowed to have children??","p016","p022",2,1,2,1
6861,202,282,12,"Person 1","I feel like that starts to stray too far into eugenics. People will mental illness are more likely to experience violence than enact it, after all.","p016","p022",2.3333,1,3.3333,2.3333
6862,202,282,13,"Person 2","Yeah, that can be a tough question. Do you know anyone with depression or suicidal thoughts?","p016","p022",1.6667,1,2.6667,1
6863,202,282,14,"Person 1","Haha, I've had them, so yes. Not in the past five years though. :)","p016","p022",2.3333,0.3333,3.3333,3.3333
6864,202,282,15,"Person 2","That's good to know! Glad you're doing better! Did you do anything to improve these thoughts?","p016","p022",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.3333
6865,202,282,16,"Person 1","Therapy's great! I recommend it to anyone, honestly.","p016","p022",2,0,2,2.6667
6866,202,282,17,"Person 2","I have a bit of depression of anxiety myself but i never thought to go to therapy because i felt like it's just like talking to a friend","p016","p022",3,1,2.6667,3.3333
6867,202,282,18,"Person 1","Yeah, but it's a friend who super knows what they're talking about, and sometimes a perspective with a bit of distance can be really helpful.","p016","p022",1.6667,0,2.3333,2
6868,202,282,19,"Person 2","That's true. Well it was nice chatting with ya! bye!","p016","p022",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
6869,202,282,20,"Person 1","bye!","p016","p022",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
6870,202,283,0,"Person 1","This incident actually happened relatively close to me.","p030","p029",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
6871,202,283,1,"Person 2","Wow, really?  I thought it was very sad.  They didn't give many details in the story though.","p030","p029",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
6872,202,283,2,"Person 1","If i remember correctly, he was an Iraq veteran who suffered from ptsd and his wife was leaving him.","p030","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2,1
6873,202,283,3,"Person 2","Awww poor guy.  What was up with the domestic violence charge, though?  That made me not feel much compassion for him.","p030","p029",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
6874,202,283,4,"Person 1","unfortunately, that's a common thread for military and police alike. He didn't know how to respond to what was unfolding around him and his family paid the ultimate price.","p030","p029",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
6875,202,283,5,"Person 2","Yeah I mean if he was a veteran, clearly he has been through a lot and was suffering.  However, I still find it hard to have sympathy for anyone who hurt their children.  Why harm them?  They are innocents.  There were other chioces he could have made to cope with what he was going through, which I\"m sure was a lot.","p030","p029",3.6667,2,3,2
6876,202,283,6,"Person 1","Projection and internalization most likely. His projected his worldview onto his children and thought they would be better off dead than living through his personal hell. I'm not expressing sympathy. I rarely have any for those who harm women and children, just stating the facts that i'm familiar with.","p030","p029",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
6877,202,283,7,"Person 2","Yeah for sure, I agree with your assessment and I agree it is still hard to have sympathy for this man.","p030","p029",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
6878,202,283,8,"Person 1","but, I do have immense sympathy for his wife. She was trying to do the right thing by her children and they still ended up getting killed.","p030","p029",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
6879,202,283,9,"Person 2","that's exactly what I said in the paragraph.  I feel so bad for her, she lost her entire family.  Can you imagine.","p030","p029",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
6880,202,283,10,"Person 1","No, I really can't. It takes so much courage to leave an abusive relationship. Then, to have it all come tumbling down around you would make it very easy to blame yourself.","p030","p029",3,1.6667,2,2
6881,202,283,11,"Person 2","yeah for sure, and she's left to pick up the pieces and deal with that.  did we talk friday afternoon?? I feel like we have been paired before.","p030","p029",2.6667,1,2,1.6667
6882,202,283,12,"Person 1","I'm not sure, but I have done quite a few of these empathy exercises over the past month or so. What makes you say that?","p030","p029",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
6883,202,283,13,"Person 2","just the way you write your responses.  I've done a ton of them too.  anyhow, hopefully she can find the support and strength she needs to rebuild her life.  I don't think I would be able to.","p030","p029",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
6884,202,283,14,"Person 1","I think it's something that would take an immense amount of time and effort to mourn properly and then confront the emotions you are feeling with an open mind and a supportive network of friends/family. The process would be absolutely daunting at the outset, but people are pretty tenacious.","p030","p029",2.6667,1,3.3333,1.6667
6885,202,283,15,"Person 2","Yeah you would definitely need a good support network.  People are certainly resilient but this woman lost everything.  So very tragic.","p030","p029",3.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
6886,202,283,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I lost a dear childhood friend seven years ago and i'm still processing the loss. It's really something to lose someone. I certainly wish her the best.","p030","p029",3.6667,1.6667,3,4
6887,202,283,17,"Person 2","I'm sorry for your loss.  It can definitely be permanently life altering to lose someone  dear to you.","p030","p029",3.6667,1,2.3333,2
6888,202,283,18,"Person 1","Thanks, it most certainly is. Well, thanks for chatting with me (again). Hope you have a great day! bye","p030","p029",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
6889,202,283,19,"Person 2","I hope you have a great day, too!  bye!","p030","p029",2,0,1.3333,1.3333
6890,202,284,0,"Person 1","hello what did you think about the article","p022","p024",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
6891,202,284,1,"Person 2","wonder why he did that","p022","p024",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
6892,202,284,2,"Person 1","Yeah they didn't give a reason. I'm guessing it's because of mental issues","p022","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6893,202,284,3,"Person 2","most likely thats usually what the cause of these things is","p022","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
6894,202,284,4,"Person 1","I just find it so disturbing how someone can kill their own children.","p022","p024",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
6895,202,284,5,"Person 2","i wonder what they did to him or if they did anything at all. It doesn't justify his actions they're his sons at the end of the day","p022","p024",2,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
6896,202,284,6,"Person 1","I think it said he killed himself as well as his two sons","p022","p024",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
6897,202,284,7,"Person 2","yeah maybe they were having problems","p022","p024",2,1,2.3333,1
6898,202,284,8,"Person 1","Maybe he had schizophrenia, a voice in his head just telling him to do it","p022","p024",2,1.3333,2.6667,1
6899,202,284,9,"Person 2","whats sad is the age of his sons. 5, and 4. Too young for any of this.","p022","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
6900,202,284,10,"Person 1","I wonder what happened to the mom... i would probalby want to kill myself after knowing what happened","p022","p024",2.3333,1.6667,4,3
6901,202,284,11,"Person 2","he told her that he wasnt going to be taken alive which tells me he was thinking and was fully aware of what he did","p022","p024",2,1.3333,2.6667,1
6902,202,284,12,"Person 1","Poor lady. Some people should not be allowed to own guns","p022","p024",3,2,3,1.6667
6903,202,284,13,"Person 2","yeah shes the one that tipped the cops imagine what she felt","p022","p024",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
6904,202,284,14,"Person 1","True. Do you think people with mentall illnesses should be allowed to have children","p022","p024",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
6905,202,284,15,"Person 2","probably not. what do you think","p022","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
6906,202,284,16,"Person 1","I would say no. They can't even take care of themselves.","p022","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
6907,202,284,17,"Person 2","yeah its like if the kids are caring for themselves.","p022","p024",1.6667,2,2,1.3333
6908,202,284,18,"Person 1","True. Well it was nice talking to you! bye!","p022","p024",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
6909,202,284,19,"Person 2","bye","p022","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
6910,202,285,0,"Person 1","hey what are your thoughts on this","p068","p022",1,1,1.3333,1
6911,202,285,1,"Person 2","I felt like it was very disturbing and sad. What about you?","p068","p022",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
6912,202,285,2,"Person 1","same here it seems unimagainable a father could be so evil","p068","p022",4,1.6667,4,2
6913,202,285,3,"Person 2","Maybe he was suffering from some sort of mental illness","p068","p022",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1
6914,202,285,4,"Person 1","I wish there was more help for men suffering","p068","p022",2,1,3.3333,1.6667
6915,202,285,5,"Person 2","Yeah, everyone thinks of men with depression as \"weak\" which is sad.","p068","p022",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
6916,202,285,6,"Person 1","I agree they suffer two mostly in silence then things like this happen","p068","p022",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
6917,202,285,7,"Person 2","Yeah. I don't think people with mental illness should have a gun","p068","p022",2,1.3333,3,2.3333
6918,202,285,8,"Person 1","Yeah I agree its hard to track that when people go undiagnosed","p068","p022",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
6919,202,285,9,"Person 2","Very hard! Do you know anyone with depression?","p068","p022",2,1,3.3333,1
6920,202,285,10,"Person 1","I have suffered it myself it can really destroy people","p068","p022",2.3333,2,3.6667,3.6667
6921,202,285,11,"Person 2","I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are better now","p068","p022",2,1,3,1
6922,202,285,12,"Person 1","I am in a good place now thank you, do you think there were more signs the mother could have picked up on","p068","p022",2.3333,0,2.6667,3.6667
6923,202,285,13,"Person 2","Probably not. I feel like nobody would expect their own husbands to kill their children. That is the last thing you think of","p068","p022",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
6924,202,285,14,"Person 1","yeah that is true and he was in trouble with domestic violence before she was probably afraid of him","p068","p022",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1
6925,202,285,15,"Person 2","Do you think you are born with mental illness or something you develop?","p068","p022",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
6926,202,285,16,"Person 1","I think so and it develops over time I really feel like it is the chemicals in your brain, like when you drink coffee it prodices seratonin and makes you feel happy iwish there was a pill to do that all the time haha","p068","p022",2.3333,0.6667,3,1.6667
6927,202,285,17,"Person 2","That's interesting, now i understand it better","p068","p022",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.3333
6928,202,285,18,"Person 1","well its been great chatting! bye","p068","p022",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
6929,202,285,19,"Person 2","bye","p068","p022",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
6930,71,286,0,"Person 1","Reading about that situation with the poachers was pretty upsetting. To think that the changes being made to ensure poaching ends and they are being stopped by local governments is just upsetting.","p028","p062",2.6667,2,3.3333,3
6931,71,286,1,"Person 2","Yes, although I'm not sure it was local governments, just local villagers.  Still, that must have been a horribly frightening experience.","p028","p062",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
6932,71,286,2,"Person 1","Yeah that could be possible, and so terrifying to just be doing your job and being attacked like that. I wonder if this is the right way to stop poaching, or if there was a better way than having people just have to grab poachers in towns like that.","p028","p062",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
6933,71,286,3,"Person 2","Yes, I'm not sure.  The whole article was a little sparse on details, which I would have appreciated.  It didn't explicitly say what the villagers were angry about, although one could guess.  And I also wondered who called for the helicopter.  Seems unlikely the rangers would have survived that scenario, but who knows.","p028","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
6934,71,286,4,"Person 1","Yeah it definetely felt like the article just wanted you to just to the conclusions on your own. I'm guessing the poachers were members of the community and that caused the mob. I wonder how the poahcer even got away from them in the first place.","p028","p062",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
6935,71,286,5,"Person 2","Yes, the fact that he escaped seemed incompetent, unfortunately.  But of course that's a large part of the story.  There aren't enough resources or competence to properly deal with the issue.  And there's probably corruption, too.","p028","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6936,71,286,6,"Person 1","Yeah for sure as easy as it seems there is so much ground for them to cover and animals to protect. If only they had more resources or there was a way to stop black market trade so poachers are not incentivized to hunt these animals.","p028","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6937,71,286,7,"Person 2","Yes, I think that's one of the tacks governments are taking is to focus on the demand.  Not sure how well it's worked but they're definitely putting pressure on things like ivory demand, maybe similar to same way that there's sort of a backlash against blood diamonds.  I was curious what animals were being poached in this story.  I don't believe it said, did it?","p028","p062",2.3333,1.6667,4,2.6667
6938,71,286,8,"Person 1","No i don't think there was a mention of it. They only mentioned the country and the continent so the first thing my mind jumped to was to african elephants which i think are still endangered. I definitely think that there is progress being made on poaching and hope stories like this are not commen.","p028","p062",2.3333,1,3,1.6667
6939,71,286,9,"Person 2","Yes, I think it's particularly disheartening when the story is of the authorities losing the battle.  I guess I feel like if nothing is currently being done to stop it, then there's the distinct possibility that change can and will happen.  But if they're already trying and failing, then it feels less likely to me that things can improve.","p028","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
6940,71,286,10,"Person 1","Yeah for sure, it seems like we never really hear articles that are good news or updates on constant issues. Or maybe that is that people know that those articles would not cause as much noise so there is less interest in talking about them.","p028","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
6941,71,286,11,"Person 2","Yes, I certainly think that's part of it.  I'm curious what will happen to the people in the village?  The article is concerned about the cowardly police officers, and I get that.  But will there be any charges brought to the villagers for nearly killing the rangers?  I'd like to know that.","p028","p062",1.6667,1.3333,3,2
6942,71,286,12,"Person 1","I don't think there is any good way to deal with the villagers, if it was a mob of people that attacked them then what do you do arrest them all? I think at best the rangers just now no they must be careful with that village.","p028","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
6943,71,286,13,"Person 2","Yes, that's a good point.  Unfortunately, I think it only serves to embolden and legitimize their actions.  If there are no repercussions for waging \"war\" on anti-poaching, then how can the anti-poaching side ever have any real authority and success?","p028","p062",2,1.6667,3,2
6944,71,286,14,"Person 1","Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse.","p028","p062",2,1.3333,3.6667,2.3333
6945,71,286,15,"Person 2","Yeah, if nothing else I'd certainly be nervous to be the guy sent there, seeing how they treated these rangers.  I feel like you'd probably have to convince people associated with poaching that there's an economically viable alternative to their poaching.  The problem is that I'm not sure what that is in Mozambique.","p028","p062",2,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6946,71,286,16,"Person 1","Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching. It feels bad but maybe there should be incentives for villages if the population of poached animals gets above a certain point?","p028","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
6947,71,286,17,"Person 2","Yes, that's certainly an idea.  I think it's just human nature.  It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  We can entertain ideas of democracy and harmony and enlightenment and whatever, so long as we're fed and clothed and housed.  But if our basic needs aren't being met, we're going to scrap and claw for what sustains us, broader society and the world be damned.","p028","p062",2,1.6667,4,2.6667
6948,71,286,18,"Person 1","Definetely, and people can only really see things for their immediate self. It is hard to think of the overall elephant population when you are now going hungry because you cannot hunt them. Oh well, even though it was about a harsh topic it was nice talking to you. goodbye","p028","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
6949,71,286,19,"Person 2","Yes, I appreciated your perspective.  It made me think.  Thanks for taking the time to chat.  Have a nice day.  bye","p028","p062",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,2
6950,71,287,0,"Person 1","I am so shocked that people that are getting the poachers arrested are getting attacked by the people in the town, you would think they would be happy to have these criminals arrested but I guess they support them","p064","p024",3,2,2.6667,2
6951,71,287,1,"Person 2","im sure there is money involved or else they wouldnt care","p064","p024",2,2,1.6667,1
6952,71,287,2,"Person 1","Yea or maybe their family is the poacher","p064","p024",2,1.6667,2.3333,1
6953,71,287,3,"Person 2","yeah money is the root of all evil","p064","p024",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
6954,71,287,4,"Person 1","Exactly, the police part is shocking too, how they just fled.. what is the point in having police if they are cowards","p064","p024",3.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
6955,71,287,5,"Person 2","that part made me angry","p064","p024",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
6956,71,287,6,"Person 1","Yes, I guess they are afraid too of the organized crime","p064","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
6957,71,287,7,"Person 2","its crazy how nothing is ever done about this though","p064","p024",2.6667,2,2.3333,1
6958,71,287,8,"Person 1","Yea, when we have no Rhino on the planet we just have ourselves to blame","p064","p024",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
6959,71,287,9,"Person 2","exactly. no one else to blame at that point.","p064","p024",2,2,2,1
6960,71,287,10,"Person 1","Because this has been going on forever, I understand when some of the animals have to be killed and somebody places a bid to kill the animal but the poaching is just ridiculous","p064","p024",3,2,2.3333,1.6667
6961,71,287,11,"Person 2","I agree that these poachers need the money off what they kill to survive but at what cost does that have to happen","p064","p024",2,2,2.3333,1.3333
6962,71,287,12,"Person 1","Yea, I wish there was something else to do for these community's so that they do not have to poach to survive but they would probably not stop anyway... i believe they get a lot of money for killing the rhinos","p064","p024",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
6963,71,287,13,"Person 2","its hard for the usa to be the world police on everything but in cases like these i feel like its appropriate","p064","p024",2,2,2,1.6667
6964,71,287,14,"Person 1","Yea, the USA is always the world police but I agree america should step in for this","p064","p024",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
6965,71,287,15,"Person 2","what do you think the consequences should be if they were ever prosecuted","p064","p024",2,1,1.6667,1
6966,71,287,16,"Person 1","I guess it depends on their role in the operation, if they are on the bottom, a few years in prison but if they are the leader of the operation i think life","p064","p024",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
6967,71,287,17,"Person 2","i agree with that it would set a example for future offenders","p064","p024",2.3333,0.6667,2,1.3333
6968,71,287,18,"Person 1","yea some people probably do it because they need to feed their children while other people are living a lavish lifestyle","p064","p024",2,1,1,1
6969,71,287,19,"Person 2","i agree ive heard of poachers who just do it as a hobby that is just insane","p064","p024",2.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
6970,71,287,20,"Person 1","Really? Thats disgusting","p064","p024",3.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333

6973,71,287,23,"Person 2","oh wow i remember hearing about that","p064","p024",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
6974,71,287,24,"Person 1","I am not sure what happened with that but he was just a disgusting individual","p064","p024",3.3333,2,1.3333,2
6975,71,287,25,"Person 2","yeah i remember watching a youtube video about it","p064","p024",2,1,1,2.3333
6976,71,287,26,"Person 1","All of these emphatic conversation HITS are really opening my eyes to all of these international world problems that I have otherwise never really thought about","p064","p024",2,0,1.6667,2.6667
6977,71,287,27,"Person 2","yeah, ive read so many of these articles now and boy oh boy did we ever get lucky to be born in the usa?","p064","p024",2,0,1,2

6983,71,288,0,"Person 1","I can understand this story from both sides, but I do not agree with the attack.","p035","p029",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,3.3333
6984,71,288,1,"Person 2","Yeah I don't either.  It's always distressing to read about angry mobs attacking a person.","p035","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
6985,71,288,2,"Person 1","How do you feel about the animals being killed?","p035","p029",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
6986,71,288,3,"Person 2","I don't think the animals should be killed for no good reason, like just to take their horns and sell them for example.  Only if the entire animal is being used for meat, food, etc. like it should be.  They didn't give many specifics about that in this story.  How do you feel about it?","p035","p029",2.3333,1,2.6667,3.6667
6987,71,288,4,"Person 1","I don't like them being killed, but I understand. People use what is around them to make money or just killed them for protection from them.","p035","p029",2,1.3333,3,2.6667
6988,71,288,5,"Person 2","Yeah I mean in some cases it is understandable.  I think it is a cultural thing that I don't know much about as far as Africa goes.  It's easy for me to sit here in the comfort of my living room and judge but I Don't really know what life is like there.","p035","p029",2,1,2.6667,3
6989,71,288,6,"Person 1","We did the same thing in America with a lot of the animals that were here. I can not get mad at them.","p035","p029",1.6667,1,3,2
6990,71,288,7,"Person 2","yeah certainly that is a part of our history.","p035","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
6991,71,288,8,"Person 1","I wonder how the horn market got so big in China?","p035","p029",2,1.3333,1,1
6992,71,288,9,"Person 2","I have no idea about that.","p035","p029",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
6993,71,288,10,"Person 1","I think a lot man would buy a product if they thought it would work to grow their manhood lol.","p035","p029",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
6994,71,288,11,"Person 2","Well sex tends to sell in general, so yeah.  But it is most likely a bogus claim no doubt.","p035","p029",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
6995,71,288,12,"Person 1","It is proven to be false, but they still believe it to be true in their culture","p035","p029",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
6996,71,288,13,"Person 2","Yeah that's kinda sad.  Preying on people's vulnerabilities.","p035","p029",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
6997,71,288,14,"Person 1","I think the rest of the world should pay if they to keep the animals safe, I believe that is the only way to really stop the poachers. What do you think?","p035","p029",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
6998,71,288,15,"Person 2","What exactly do you mean by the rest of the world should pay?","p035","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
6999,71,288,16,"Person 1","The people who do not live in those countries should donate to that area so people do not have to kill the animals for profit.","p035","p029",2,1,2,3
7000,71,288,17,"Person 2","Hmm, I disagree.  I think we have enough problems in our own country to be trying to solve other country's issues, but if people want to donate they are always free to do that.  I don't think it should be cursory though.  That would be infuriating.","p035","p029",2,1.6667,2,3.6667
7001,71,288,18,"Person 1","I'm sorry I didn't say it clear. I was trying to say what you said. It would be a donation choice for the people who care about the animals. If you don't care then do not donate in my opinion.","p035","p029",2,1.6667,2.3333,3
7002,71,288,19,"Person 2","Yes, I agree with that.  I think there are foundations that exist where you can do that if you would like to support that cause.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye","p035","p029",1.6667,0,2,2
7003,71,288,20,"Person 1","You too. bye","p035","p029",1.3333,1,1.6667,1

7005,71,289,1,"Person 2","Yes I agree. feel bad for the rangers and the animals","p063","p009",2.3333,2,3,2
7006,71,289,2,"Person 1","I wonder what the reasons for the community mob were?  I'll bet the poachers are paying off both the police, and the community.","p063","p009",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
7007,71,289,3,"Person 2","Yeah it could definitely be something like that","p063","p009",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7008,71,289,4,"Person 1","Boy that's a tough place to be if you're a ranger?  Can't get any support.  I hope the government figures this out.","p063","p009",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
7009,71,289,5,"Person 2","I agree. Before the animals are all wiped out","p063","p009",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
7010,71,289,6,"Person 1","Yeah.  I've heard the more the animal population dwindles, the more expensive the items get.  Kind of makes the poachers try even harder.  Kind of a death cycle.","p063","p009",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
7011,71,289,7,"Person 2","That isnt suprising. It seems kind of lawless out there","p063","p009",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
7012,71,289,8,"Person 1","It's the civilized world's fault too.  Especially China, their the ones buying all the ivory and what not.","p063","p009",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
7013,71,289,9,"Person 2","yeah they're real big on that. and the rhino horns","p063","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7014,71,289,10,"Person 1","Yeah, as much as I'd hate to see it.  I wonder if it'd be better to just let these people have a bunch of rhinos to make a rhino farm, then they could just cut the horns off periodically?  Kind of like sheep and their wool?","p063","p009",2,1.3333,2,2
7015,71,289,11,"Person 2","Well since the science behind is isnt even real, theyd be better off just synthesizing something and selling it as the rhino horn powder","p063","p009",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7016,71,289,12,"Person 1","ooo that's true. getting some fake rhino stuff on the market.  aren't rhino horns just like our fingernails or something?","p063","p009",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
7017,71,289,13,"Person 2","I really dont know but i know they dont have any magical power","p063","p009",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
7018,71,289,14,"Person 1","Oh I see what you're saying.  I didn't know that they thought rhino horns had some sort of value other than for aesthetics.","p063","p009",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
7019,71,289,15,"Person 2","they think they give them sexual powers, lol","p063","p009",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
7020,71,289,16,"Person 1","Lol well I guess Americans think that about certain things too, they're just not endangered.  ie. horny goat weed...","p063","p009",2,1,1,1.6667
7021,71,289,17,"Person 2","true but i dont think people take that too seriously here, where as in China they are very serious about it","p063","p009",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7022,71,289,18,"Person 1","lol China is ruining everything!","p063","p009",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
7023,71,289,19,"Person 2","they do cause a lot of pollution lol","p063","p009",2,1.6667,0.6667,2
7024,71,289,20,"Person 1","yes they do. I've heard they're starting to build giant filters now, for their air pollution problem... crazy.","p063","p009",2.3333,1,1.3333,2
7025,71,289,21,"Person 2","well i suppose thats good at least","p063","p009",1.6667,0,1,1.6667
7026,71,289,22,"Person 1","problem is that's a localized issue.  they need to correct their massive global warming pollution problem.","p063","p009",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7027,71,289,23,"Person 2","yes i agree with that","p063","p009",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
7028,71,289,24,"Person 1","Them and India.  I don't blame India too much though.  There's just a billion of them, and they're all just now being able to afford a/c, so of course they'll need the energy for all that progress.","p063","p009",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
7029,71,289,25,"Person 2","india has bad problems with just trash in general","p063","p009",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
7030,71,289,26,"Person 1","Yeah, from what I've seen of their cities, they aren't in good shape.  Especially their rivers.","p063","p009",1.6667,2,1,2

7034,71,290,1,"Person 2","thought theyre on the wrong side for siding with the poachers","p068","p024",2,2,1.6667,2
7035,71,290,2,"Person 1","the village people you think are on the wrong side","p068","p024",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
7036,71,290,3,"Person 2","yes but also I see things from their perspective I'","p068","p024",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
7037,71,290,4,"Person 1","yeah same here i can see both sides of it","p068","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2
7038,71,290,5,"Person 2","yep the villagers probably profit financially from the poaching and they are poor so it helps","p068","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
7039,71,290,6,"Person 1","exactly probably felt like there life line was being cut off","p068","p024",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
7040,71,290,7,"Person 2","yeah I dont blame them","p068","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
7041,71,290,8,"Person 1","but brutally beating these guys thats severe","p068","p024",3,2,2.3333,2
7042,71,290,9,"Person 2","yeah they went too crazy there","p068","p024",3,2,2.3333,2
7043,71,290,10,"Person 1","they must be starving and going crazy","p068","p024",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
7044,71,290,11,"Person 2","that explains how they reacted to this","p068","p024",2,1,2,1.3333
7045,71,290,12,"Person 1","i wonder if any of them will be arrested for it","p068","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
7046,71,290,13,"Person 2","that will be interesting to see","p068","p024",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7047,71,290,14,"Person 1","those men were so strong to survive and want to go back","p068","p024",2.6667,0,2.3333,1.6667
7048,71,290,15,"Person 2","do you think this will continue","p068","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333

7052,71,290,19,"Person 2","bye","p068","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
7053,242,291,0,"Person 1","This was very sad.  55 civilians killed?  that's crazy.","p029","p062",3,2,3.6667,2.3333
7054,242,291,1,"Person 2","Yes, that seems like quite a lot.  I'm guessing it was from an air strike for it to be that many.","p029","p062",2.6667,2,3,2
7055,242,291,2,"Person 1","yeah it must have been","p029","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
7056,242,291,3,"Person 2","These wars where we try to isolate the enemy and spare the civilians drag on and on.  Guerilla wars and insurgent wars.","p029","p062",2,2,2.3333,2
7057,242,291,4,"Person 1","yeah seriously.  It seems like so much needless killing, like those were 55 innocent people with lives, personalities, etc.","p029","p062",3,2,3.3333,2
7058,242,291,5,"Person 2","Yes, it's hard to imagine what that would be like to live in a warzone.  It's one thing to sign up to do that.  But when one comes to you it's another story.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
7059,242,291,6,"Person 1","yeah exactly.  u.s. troops died too but they kinda went into things knowing that could happen","p029","p062",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
7060,242,291,7,"Person 2","Those were two very experienced and relatively high-ranking troops.  Interesting that it wasn't lower ranking people, who are more plentiful.  Although maybe the operation was skewed because it was a joint exercise.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
7061,242,291,8,"Person 1","yeah kinda hard to say.  I don't know much about all that.","p029","p062",2,1,2,2
7062,242,291,9,"Person 2","It is a tough question about what to do with these places, however.  If we leave I doubt the government will hold up to Taliban forces.","p029","p062",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
7063,242,291,10,"Person 1","yeah I am inclined to say we should not get involved but I think it is way, way too late for that","p029","p062",2,2,1.6667,2
7064,242,291,11,"Person 2","Right, we have to make decisions from where we stand, unfortunately.","p029","p062",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
7065,242,291,12,"Person 1","yeah exactly","p029","p062",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
7066,242,291,13,"Person 2","I sort of feel like we shouldn't enter wars unless we're willing to fight them all-out.  Wars like WWII are brutal, but they end.  If you try to fight wars with one hand tied behind your back, it's unfair to your own troops, and it doesn't usually result in resolution.","p029","p062",2,2,2,2.3333
7067,242,291,14,"Person 1","Yeah I hear that.  I think there is no really good answer to it all, I mean innocent people will end up dying regardless.  Just very sad in general","p029","p062",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
7068,242,291,15,"Person 2","I think they said we're going to start decreasing troop numbers in Afghanistan.  I'll be very interested to see what happens to that country whenever we leave.  I imagine it won't be good.  But at this point I'm not sure there's any good solution.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2,2.3333
7069,242,291,16,"Person 1","Yeah I agree.  There is no good solution, it","p029","p062",1.6667,2,2,1.3333
7070,242,291,17,"Person 2","It's also possible that the Taliban, in whatever form it currently takes, is mostly pissed off about U.S. presence, and if we leave they could theoretically make some attempt to reconcile with the Afghan government.  But who knows.","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2,2.3333
7071,242,291,18,"Person 1","Yeah I totally agree.  Is it possible we are just making things worse?  Anyway, it has been great speaking with you.  I hope you enjoy your day, goodbye","p029","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7072,242,291,19,"Person 2","Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.  bye","p029","p062",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
7073,242,292,0,"Person 1","After reading that article i think what makes me the saddest is hearing that the Doctors Without Borders facility was hit during the morter attack. Volunteers who just wanted to help people, terrible.","p028","p024",3.6667,2,3.6667,3
7074,242,292,1,"Person 2","Imagine going out of your way to help the  people in need and it turns out you end up dead. That is terrible.","p028","p024",3.3333,2,3.6667,3.3333
7075,242,292,2,"Person 1","So terrible, and incredibly upsetting. I find it so hard to believe that anyone could knowingly target something like that or a hospital or something. It just seems wrong.","p028","p024",4.3333,2,3.6667,3.3333
7076,242,292,3,"Person 2","i can only imagine what their loved ones are going through. They would not have expected this in a million years.","p028","p024",3,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
7077,242,292,4,"Person 1","Definitely, it must be their worst nightmare come true. It makes me wonder whether or not people can still believe in their side of the conflict when they are attacking volunteer hospitals.","p028","p024",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
7078,242,292,5,"Person 2","what do you think is their reasoning behind the attacks?","p028","p024",1.6667,1,1,2
7079,242,292,6,"Person 1","If i had to guess it is just a message to get out of the country or something like that. I could not think of anything else.","p028","p024",2,1.3333,2,2
7080,242,292,7,"Person 2","at least hopefully they realize there is better ways to get that point across","p028","p024",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
7081,242,292,8,"Person 1","I would hope so, I want to believe that they did not know what the building was or it was amistake that it was hit but that may be wishful thinking.","p028","p024",2,0,2,2.3333
7082,242,292,9,"Person 2","probably something like that is what they would say. there is no way they would admit to doing it on purpose honestly","p028","p024",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7083,242,292,10,"Person 1","Yeah they definetely wouldn't. I know that there is a good reason for the US to be there and they are trying to improve things for the citzens there. But when i read about the loss of lives like what happened with the soldiers also it makes me question our involvement.","p028","p024",2.3333,2,2.3333,3
7084,242,292,11,"Person 2","yeah we need to stop trying to be the world police","p028","p024",2,2,1.3333,2.3333
7085,242,292,12,"Person 1","Yeah it seems like while it may help people in the short term in the long term it just makes everyone resent us more.","p028","p024",2,2,1.3333,2.6667
7086,242,292,13,"Person 2","yeah it would be best to focus on our own problems","p028","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
7087,242,292,14,"Person 1","Definitely, as selfish as it sounds those countries may just need to fix their problems without us cause we may just be making things worse. Or at least let organizations like Doctors Without Borders help where they can","p028","p024",2,1,1.6667,3.3333
7088,242,292,15,"Person 2","yeah let the organizations help and let their leaders fix their problems","p028","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
7089,242,292,16,"Person 1","I just hope that the organizations are able to protect themselves, after what happened here i could see them being unwilling to go to certain places out of fear for their safety, which makes sense.","p028","p024",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
7090,242,292,17,"Person 2","they would definitely need some sort of security in these dangerous places","p028","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
7091,242,292,18,"Person 1","Yeah either security or guarentees from leaders or governments that they will not be harmed in anyway, but even then that only goes so far","p028","p024",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
7092,242,292,19,"Person 2","I definitely agree with that. It's been a good talk. bye","p028","p024",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
7093,242,292,20,"Person 1","Yeah was nice talking to you. goodbye","p028","p024",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
7094,242,293,0,"Person 1","I know war is war, but I still do not like this.","p035","p073",2,2,1.6667,2
7095,242,293,1,"Person 2","No, it","p035","p073",1,1,0.6667,1
7096,242,293,2,"Person 1","I think this makes more terrorist, what do you think?","p035","p073",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7097,242,293,3,"Person 2","Sorry, I accidentally hit enter before. I think you're right, and the people that you are fighting for are more likely to turn against you too.","p035","p073",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
7098,242,293,4,"Person 1","It's okay, I know mistakes happen.  We killed more civilians than terrorist with that air strike","p035","p073",2,1.6667,2,2
7099,242,293,5,"Person 2","And I think it was supposed to be a training mission for Afghan forces, which seems like a complete failure.","p035","p073",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
7100,242,293,6,"Person 1","I would want to get some revenge if you killed someone in my family.","p035","p073",3.3333,2,3.6667,3.3333
7101,242,293,7,"Person 2","Definitely, the civilians were probably not being harmed as much by the Taliban. Their main enemy is probably the people fighting against the Taliban.","p035","p073",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
7102,242,293,8,"Person 1","I think as a society as a whole we do not value others lives as much as we should. What do you think?","p035","p073",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
7103,242,293,9,"Person 2","I think people mainly care about themselves.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
7104,242,293,10,"Person 1"," We made our point in the middle east, I think it is time to pull the troops out.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
7105,242,293,11,"Person 2","I can see both ways. I can see how it can cause problems being there for too long, but also leaving the area might allow problems to rise back up.","p035","p073",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
7106,242,293,12,"Person 1","I wouldn't mind having troops stay if that is what the people of that country want.  After 9/11 I do not think there will be a major attack like that again, so the terrorist are not a threat to us.","p035","p073",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.6667
7107,242,293,13,"Person 2","I wish I could believe that. Why do you think nothing like that will happen again?","p035","p073",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
7108,242,293,14,"Person 1","Look at all the rules at the airport and the patriot act. They are on top of it in my opinion. , I still believe it may be a small scale attack but nothing large like 9/11.","p035","p073",2,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
7109,242,293,15,"Person 2","I would hope so, but I think the terrorists are constantly trying to think of new ways to commit terror, even biological and chemical attacks.","p035","p073",2,1.6667,1.3333,2
7110,242,293,16,"Person 1","Yeah I agree, I worry more about China and Russia when it comes to those kind of attacks.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.6667,1,2.3333
7111,242,293,17,"Person 2","I appreciate your optimism! It makes me feel a little better.","p035","p073",2,0,1.3333,2
7112,242,293,18,"Person 1","Currently I'm more scare of an home grown mass shooter than a out of country terrorist. It makes me sick to have to worry about my kids at school.","p035","p073",2.6667,2,1.3333,3
7113,242,293,19,"Person 2","That's what makes me still worried about terrorist attacks, because when you see what some of these kids do and no one can stop them, I don't see how we can stop terrorist groups that have much more capabilities and access to weapons.","p035","p073",2.6667,2,1.6667,2.6667
7114,242,293,20,"Person 1","I think the government watches the terrorist more and the kids slip through the cracks, but you could be right too.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
7115,242,293,21,"Person 2","I just feel that in most of the instances, home or terrorist, our government is always reacting, like remove your shoes at the airport because there was a shoe bomber. Or the kid had a lot of signs that he was going to do something but we couldn't do anything because he hadn't committed a crime yet.","p035","p073",2,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
7116,242,293,22,"Person 1","I'm torn between protection from terrorist and restriction of my freedoms. How about you?","p035","p073",2,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
7117,242,293,23,"Person 2","I am too, but if restricting my freedoms is keeping myself and my family safe, I can tolerate some to a point.","p035","p073",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
7118,242,293,24,"Person 1","I calmed you down and you got me worried lol.","p035","p073",2.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333
7119,242,293,25,"Person 2","Sorry! Maybe we just met somewhere in the middle! It's been nice talking to you.","p035","p073",2.3333,0,1.3333,2
7120,242,293,26,"Person 1","you too! bye","p035","p073",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333

7122,242,294,0,"Person 1","I can't believe that we're still fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan...","p063","p030",3,2,2,2.6667
7123,242,294,1,"Person 2","I can, unfortunately.","p063","p030",2,1.6667,2,2
7124,242,294,2,"Person 1","I'm sure when Bush said that we were gonna go get those evildoers back in 2001, there weren't a lot of peole that thought we'd still be at it twenty years later.","p063","p030",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
7125,242,294,3,"Person 2","Civilians? No. The military contractors, oil barons and politicians were counting on it.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
7126,242,294,4,"Person 1","This is true.War is big business.","p063","p030",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7127,242,294,5,"Person 2","Yep, human lives are nothing weighed against big piles of money.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
7128,242,294,6,"Person 1","When you listen to the guys with the boots on the ground though, they tell a different story about how they need to be there.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
7129,242,294,7,"Person 2","I only have one living relative who served. The vehicle he was in ran over an IED and he was the only one who survived. He now requires static pulses directly applied to his spinal column to feel/use his lower body.","p063","p030",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
7130,242,294,8,"Person 1","damn.  that sucks.  I hate hearing that kind of stuff.","p063","p030",3.6667,2,1.3333,3
7131,242,294,9,"Person 2","The thing is, he's not bitter about it at all. The article hardly mentions the Afghan civilians who were murdered, who didn't sign up for this kind of horror","p063","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
7132,242,294,10,"Person 1","Yeah they're definitely lost in the middle of all this conflict.  And it's hard to blame some of them for developing a resentment of us and the western world.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
7133,242,294,11,"Person 2","That resentment will live on for generations. Foreign powers make their home unlivable and then refuse them when they try to leave.","p063","p030",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
7134,242,294,12,"Person 1","And you know they know we're using them for their oil.","p063","p030",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
7135,242,294,13,"Person 2","We can't move away from the stuff quick enough.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7136,242,294,14,"Person 1","i know it would solve so mny of the worlds problems if we could get away from oil.","p063","p030",2,1,1.3333,2.3333
7137,242,294,15,"Person 2","Wealthy people will always find a reason to sacrifice the poor. In 100 years it will be for water, etc, etc","p063","p030",2.6667,2,1.6667,3
7138,242,294,16,"Person 1","It is pretty remarkable the lengths humans will go to to attain/preserve their power.","p063","p030",2.6667,1.6667,2,3
7139,242,294,17,"Person 2","Much further than they will go to be happy","p063","p030",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
7140,242,294,18,"Person 1","Yeah it's almost an addiction.  An addiction that makes them lose touch of their humanity.","p063","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
7141,242,294,19,"Person 2","We're a cursed breed, to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting! You were a delight. bye","p063","p030",2.3333,1,2,2.3333

7144,242,295,1,"Person 2","I think it's sad...","p029","p019",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
7145,242,295,2,"Person 1","Well yeah, 30 civilians died.  I think it was very sad.  These people are caught up in this ridiculous conflict.","p029","p019",4,2,2,2.3333
7146,242,295,3,"Person 2","Yes, and it seems like for no reason","p029","p019",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333
7147,242,295,4,"Person 1","Hey, with all due respect, would you mind responding a little bit faster?  The HIT will expire if there is so long between responses and it makes it hard to have a conversation.  :)  Anyway, yes it seems like such senseless killing.  I can't imagine how the people living there must feel.","p029","p019",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
7148,242,295,5,"Person 2","Yes sorry my internet is being weird. I wouldhate living there... and hate having to go to war over there","p029","p019",3,2,1.6667,2.6667

7150,242,295,7,"Person 2","For sure... it's crazy that things like this are still going on in today's day and age","p029","p019",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
7151,242,295,8,"Person 1","YEah seriously, you would think we would be past this.  Plus, that war has been going on since the beginning of time it seems","p029","p019",2.3333,2,2,1.3333
7152,242,295,9,"Person 2","Agreed! It seems never ending... and there is no end in sight","p029","p019",2.3333,2,2,2

7154,242,295,11,"Person 2","Me neither... like why is it even going on? what are we fighting over","p029","p019",2,2,2,2.3333
7155,242,295,12,"Person 1","Yeah exactly!  I mean, I get that it has to do with oil, and terrorists, but it seems like there's more to it.  Regardless, what terrible luck to be born there.","p029","p019",3,2,2,2
7156,242,295,13,"Person 2","There has to be more to it! And why are we putting oil above human lives... it's awful","p029","p019",3.6667,2,3,2

7161,242,295,18,"Person 1","Yeah I was thinking the same, and my kids are everything to me.  So that's saying a lot.

7164,339,296,1,"Person 2","what do you think should be done?","p062","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
7165,339,296,2,"Person 1","If nothing else I think countries that are likely destinations for large groups of refugees should decide, democratically, how they want to deal with them.  But those decisions need to be made before thousands are standing on your doorstep.","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
7166,339,296,3,"Person 2","the ones that do go to your doorstep should be sent back and apply at the embassy of the country they want to live in, or something like that","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
7167,339,296,4,"Person 1","Sure, I think it should definitely be recognized that the refugees have no inherent right to what they're seeking.  Countries have every right to take none of them and send them away, to apply elsewhere or just to go away.","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
7168,339,296,5,"Person 2","Exactly. Listen I'm all for being tolerant but we have a lot of problems at home already we can't just let everyone in. Can you imagine that.","p062","p024",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7169,339,296,6,"Person 1","Absolutely.  We live by laws and borders, for the betterment of the most.  We have to keep doing that.  And I think a nation's and a government's first responsibility is to its own people.  As I say, I'd like a democratic process to decide how countries deal with these issues.  Let the people decide whether they want masses of refugees coming in. Why isn't that the people's say?","p062","p024",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
7170,339,296,7,"Person 2","Yeah we have no problem helping other countries get better. We should just focus on making their countries better.","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7171,339,296,8,"Person 1","I'm curious as to where these refugees were from.  They were staying in Calais, which is in NW France, across from the UK.  It said their homes were burning.  That seems like a weird place for a refugee camp, or for people to be coming as refugees.","p062","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
7172,339,296,9,"Person 2","I'm guessing Africa? I know Africa has many many African immigrants. I watch a lot of soccer and most of the French players are of African ancestry, also watched a few docs about that situation.","p062","p024",2,1,1.6667,2.3333
7173,339,296,10,"Person 1","Yes, it certainly could Africa.  I also thought it was interesting that France promised space for 12,000 and then cut it off before that.  I wonder what prompts such a decision.","p062","p024",2,1,1.6667,2

7175,339,296,12,"Person 1","Yes, certainly could be that.  Again, another reason why I think the people's input should happen before government starts dealing with these large groups.","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
7176,339,296,13,"Person 2","Yeah, it seems the governments have an interest in letting this happen all across Europe though. Heck, even in our own southern border we've been getting African immigrants. It seems people from Mexico don't even cross to the US anymore it's all central american and african immigrants. I wonder who's sending them.","p062","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
7177,339,296,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I don't know.  But I fear it's going to be a bigger and bigger problem as transportation and communication become easier and make people, including large groups, more mobile","p062","p024",2.6667,2,2,2.6667
7178,339,296,15,"Person 2","yeah it seems like technology makes it easier for these people to come together","p062","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7179,339,296,16,"Person 1","I think it's also easier for them to see other lifestyles and cultures and understand that there are better lives elsewhere.  That encourages them to flee.","p062","p024",2,1.3333,2,2
7180,339,296,17,"Person 2","they watch TV and see these first world countries living big and want to live that way.","p062","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7181,339,296,18,"Person 1","Yes, I think that's part of it, and part of this growing trend to see the world as \"borderless,\" which it's not.","p062","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
7182,339,296,19,"Person 2","if the world was borderless we'd be like the wild wild west all over again.","p062","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
7183,339,296,20,"Person 1","Absolutely.  We have to have laws, whether people like recognize that or not.  People would not prefer true anarchy.  Anyway, good chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye","p062","p024",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
7184,339,296,21,"Person 2","bye","p062","p024",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
7185,339,297,0,"Person 1","Well, I had mixed feelings about this.  What did you think?","p029","p063",2,1,1.6667,2
7186,339,297,1,"Person 2","Me as well.  I feel bad for these people, but I don't necessarily blame the governments.  There is a massive influx of refugees globally, and no existing programs can handle them all.","p029","p063",2.6667,1.3333,3,2.3333
7187,339,297,2,"Person 1","Yes exactly my thoughts!!  I feel bad for them too, but who is supposed to be funding their care","p029","p063",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
7188,339,297,3,"Person 2","Yeah.  I get that they're not in great conditions, and that sucks, but it's asking a lot to suddenly create good living conditions for so many people.","p029","p063",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
7189,339,297,4,"Person 1","Yeah totally.  It is unreasonable to expect really.  Again, who would pay for it?  Taxpayers?  that's not really fair.","p029","p063",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
7190,339,297,5,"Person 2","Yeah, and I know people don't like to hear this, but it really is compounded by the fact that many of these refugees come from areas that harbor terrorists.","p029","p063",2.3333,2,3,2
7191,339,297,6,"Person 1","yes very true.  I googled and it said a lot from that camp were from syria and surrounding areas","p029","p063",2,1.6667,2,3
7192,339,297,7,"Person 2","I was wondering that.  I didn't really know where Calais was, so I didn't know where these people were from.","p029","p063",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
7193,339,297,8,"Person 1","Yeah it was in france in 2015-6, and the majority were from syria and two other countries I have not  heard of","p029","p063",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
7194,339,297,9,"Person 2","Ah.  Yeah, people don't like it, but you do have to be shrewd when allowing people in from an ISIS controlled area.","p029","p063",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
7195,339,297,10,"Person 1","Eritrea and Somalia.  I had forgotten, sorry.  But yeah, you totally do have to be very careful.  And this might be horrible to say, but I would imagine the conditions were still better than those they came from.","p029","p063",2.3333,1,2,2.6667
7196,339,297,11,"Person 2","Sure, otherwise they'd just go back right?  At least this place gives them some sort of hope?","p029","p063",1.3333,0.3333,2,1.6667
7197,339,297,12,"Person 1","that was my thinking, too.","p029","p063",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
7198,339,297,13,"Person 2","Maybe that's terrible of us to think, but I feel like it's the truth.","p029","p063",2,0.6667,2,2.3333
7199,339,297,14,"Person 1","I feel like it is the truth.  Google claims the camp began to grow, with migrants from iraq and afghanistan showing up.  Then things like fights and violence began to break out amongst the people.  it apparently became a big problem.","p029","p063",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
7200,339,297,15,"Person 2","Again, I hate to say it, but what is with this region of the world?  I'm sure I sound like a bad person, but I just feel like the religion of Islam lends itself to some pretty crappy conditions.","p029","p063",2.3333,2,2,3
7201,339,297,16,"Person 1","No, you don't sound bad.  I agree.  I don't understand what is going on over there.  It all seems so negative.","p029","p063",2,1.3333,1.6667,3
7202,339,297,17,"Person 2","I was at the zoo with my son the other day in florida, and the heat index was almost 110.  There was a muslim couple there and the woman was completely clothed in her hijab, and I just felt bad for her.  What kind of religion forces people to swelter in the hot dessert sun?","p029","p063",2,1.6667,2,3.3333
7203,339,297,18,"Person 1","Yes that's a great example.  It just seems backwards and irrational, and inhumane.  Anyway, I am very grateful to be an American in the USA.  It has been a pleasure speaking with you, I Hope you have a great rest of your day.  goodbye","p029","p063",2,0.6667,2,2.3333
7204,339,297,19,"Person 2","you too! bye.","p029","p063",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
7205,339,298,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p019","p029",0.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
7206,339,298,1,"Person 2","Well, I think we need more information.  I read a different article about the Calais camp and it gave a different story.  The refugees were apparently causing problems there, and it got out of hand.  I don't really know what to think.  I feel sad for children who suffered.  What did you think?","p019","p029",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7207,339,298,2,"Person 1","That is interesting that there might be another side to this article, it didn't really elude to that","p019","p029",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
7208,339,298,3,"Person 2","Yeah no it did not.  It seemed a bit biased to me.  But regardless, it certainly sounds like the situation got out of hand.  The camp couldn't be supported and there wren't enough resources there.  I know it became a big problem for the French government.  They had to clear it all out.","p019","p029",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
7209,339,298,4,"Person 1","It does seem a bit biased, like they are trying to pull at our sympathy. How did the French government handle it?","p019","p029",1.6667,1,2.6667,2
7210,339,298,5,"Person 2","Yes, that was my take on it too.  They cleared the camp out!  It was causing too many problems. IT took several attempts and the refugees protested, burned things, threw rocks, etc., the typical rioting behavior.  But eventually they were put out and I think most went to other countries or areas and carried on.","p019","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
7211,339,298,6,"Person 1","That's crazy... so it seems like both parties could be at fault","p019","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
7212,339,298,7,"Person 2","yes that was my thoughts","p019","p029",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
7213,339,298,8,"Person 1","It's weird that this had a biased article. All the ones I've done have seemed not so","p019","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
7214,339,298,9,"Person 2","I think I may have encountered a few that seemed biased.  I actually read another article on here about Calais camp and it was a little less biased.  It certainly didn't use the word \"abusive\".","p019","p029",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
7215,339,298,10,"Person 1","Interesting... Either way... the kids is what get me. They did nothing and do not deserve what is happening to them/going on around them","p019","p029",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
7216,339,298,11,"Person 2","Yes I think it is sad for the kids, too.  innocents.  they kinda made it out like it was just a bunch of kids, though.  accoring to another article it was 62% med aged 33 on average","p019","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
7217,339,298,12,"Person 1","Interesting... I think their banking on the kids aspect is what's grabbing peoples attention and putting the sympathy vote on them","p019","p029",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
7218,339,298,13,"Person 2","I meant to say \"men\", but yeah I agree.  It seems like they only covered part of the story.  But all bias aside, I do think it is sad for the children who were there.  I wonder how old they were?  like teens or little kids?","p019","p029",2,2,2.3333,2.6667
7219,339,298,14,"Person 1","Probably a mix of both... Can you imagine growing up in that kind of tramau?","p019","p029",2,2,2.3333,2.6667
7220,339,298,15,"Person 2","It would be terrible, and the other article said a lot of the children were unaccompanied, so where were the parents??","p019","p029",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
7221,339,298,16,"Person 1","Oh no I hope they aren't dead...","p019","p029",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
7222,339,298,17,"Person 2","yeah that would be very sad, I guess it is possible","p019","p029",2,2,2.6667,2.3333
7223,339,298,18,"Person 1","That or they are not there for their children, which is sad as well","p019","p029",2,2,3.3333,2.3333
7224,339,298,19,"Person 2","Yeah good point, that is equally tragic.  Well I must go, thanks for the talk!  bye","p019","p029",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
7225,339,298,20,"Person 1","BYE","p019","p029",1,1,0.6667,1.3333

7237,339,299,8,"Person 1","I wonder if there's anything we can do to help","p022","p039",2,0.6667,2,2
7238,339,299,9,"Person 2","we need to help out our own citizens","p022","p039",1.3333,1.3333,2,2

7256,339,300,5,"Person 2","people of France need to protest and go in there and do something, however, it's a greater problem-France should have never allowed them to come in the first place! We cannot continue to solve problems of immigrants but rather help them fix their own country so they don't end up in this situation in the first place!","p024","p031",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
7257,339,300,6,"Person 1","i cant speak for t he french but i wouldnt want so many immigrants maybe a few but not that many","p024","p031",1.6667,2,1.6667,2

7259,339,300,8,"Person 1","Another thing is, everyone expects America to help in these kinds of situations and its time they help themselves and we look after our own first","p024","p031",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
7260,339,300,9,"Person 2","amen to that! Look at our economy-disgrace, we have homeless camps in San Fransisco and yet we allow Mexican immigrants to march over and pay their rent, medical and food-no words!","p024","p031",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
7261,339,300,10,"Person 1","yeah the central american immigrants just cross across mexico and the usa and blame those countries for not allowing them to cross","p024","p031",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667

7283,347,301,9,"Person 2","im glad america is civilized and we have so much structure with our government","p024","p068",2,0.3333,1.6667,2
7284,347,301,10,"Person 1","yeah it has its faults but youre much better off here than elsewhere","p024","p068",2.6667,0.3333,2,2
7285,347,301,11,"Person 2","I can't imagine having little food and a dirty water supply","p024","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7286,347,301,12,"Person 1","yeah the fact that water is necessary for life makes it scary that youd be forced to gulp that dirty water down","p024","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
7287,347,301,13,"Person 2","especially growing children they are so malnourished cant see a great quality of life after","p024","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
7288,347,301,14,"Person 1","id give up my food to my children in that position and id be the malnourished one but its tough","p024","p068",2.3333,1.3333,3.6667,3
7289,347,301,15,"Person 2","yeah i would two but the father was gone and mother went off somewhere to seek treatment that sucks","p024","p068",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
7290,347,301,16,"Person 1","yeah thats just terrible to read","p024","p068",2.3333,2,3.6667,2
7291,347,301,17,"Person 2","what a damper in the day haha","p024","p068",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7292,347,301,18,"Person 1","yeah man just ruins your mood lol","p024","p068",2,1.3333,2,2.3333

7294,347,301,20,"Person 1","thanks man its been a good talk i enjoyed it. bye","p024","p068",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
7295,347,301,21,"Person 2","me two bye!","p024","p068",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
7296,347,302,0,"Person 1","Hello","p052","p036",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
7297,347,302,1,"Person 2","Hi. How are you?","p052","p036",1,1,0.3333,1
7298,347,302,2,"Person 1","What did you think of the article","p052","p036",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
7299,347,302,3,"Person 2","It makes me quite sad. I feel for these people without food available.","p052","p036",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
7300,347,302,4,"Person 1","Tell me about it","p052","p036",1,1.3333,0.6667,1
7301,347,302,5,"Person 2","ABout the article or my sadness?","p052","p036",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7302,347,302,6,"Person 1","Both. I think there needs to be more support","p052","p036",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
7303,347,302,7,"Person 2","It seems to me from the article that the problem is less about getting the support in the area, and more about building a structure for self support. For instance, the farmers are unable to return to usable land because they are not secure there.","p052","p036",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
7304,347,302,8,"Person 1","I think some support is need to secure the land to make it usable, dont you think?","p052","p036",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
7305,347,302,9,"Person 2","Well, the article legitimately points out that this support has to be mandated by government first. Getting food to the people is one action that is beneficial, but it isn't curbing the real problems.","p052","p036",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
7306,347,302,10,"Person 1","i see","p052","p036",1,1,0.6667,1
7307,347,302,11,"Person 2","So, I think the lesson here is that there really needs to be some counseling available for recovering governments - as crazy as that sounds - a not-for-profit that can help a sincere government regain control after something like the Boko Haram issue","p052","p036",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
7308,347,302,12,"Person 1","I like that solution","p052","p036",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
7309,347,302,13,"Person 2","Of course, it requires a lot sincerity on the part of the government. I think it is has a potential to be more effective than the mandated democracy via military action that the US tried in Iraq.","p052","p036",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
7310,347,302,14,"Person 1","True","p052","p036",1,0.6667,1,1
7311,347,302,15,"Person 2","What gets me, though, as a parent, is the idea that the kids have to suffer for the follies of the adults. What do you think about all the suffering that comes from these horrible situations? How could that be managed?","p052","p036",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
7312,347,302,16,"Person 1","I think leaders in the region needs to step up and do something or remove them","p052","p036",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
7313,347,302,17,"Person 2","If they are removed, how should it be done, and who should be put in their place?","p052","p036",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
7314,347,302,18,"Person 1","Put some people that serve their immediate interest. Someone with vision and enough power to get things done","p052","p036",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
7315,347,302,19,"Person 2","Rome had a triumvirate. Three people in charge. Should a constitution allow a group of three to be installed when a single leadeer has failed?","p052","p036",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
7316,347,302,20,"Person 1","I think they should i think it makes better sense to me","p052","p036",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7317,347,302,21,"Person 2","That's nice. My timer is almost how. I think you need to say bye first if you are done with the conversation","p052","p036",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1
7318,347,302,22,"Person 1","ok goodbye","p052","p036",1,1,0.6667,1
7319,347,302,23,"Person 2","bye","p052","p036",1,1,0.6667,1
7320,347,303,0,"Person 1","Well, what did you think?","p022","p048",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
7321,347,303,1,"Person 2","It's always so sad to read about these countries struggling with hunger. It constantly makes you feel like we don't do enough","p022","p048",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
7322,347,303,2,"Person 1","It's terrible because we even waste food on the daily","p022","p048",3,2,2,2
7323,347,303,3,"Person 2","Exactly. Not one family in even North America can say that they don't waste any food.","p022","p048",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
7324,347,303,4,"Person 1","I am guilty of that. I always end up throwing away leftovers","p022","p048",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
7325,347,303,5,"Person 2","Oh yes. Even America's standards of expiration dates is a lie and we know it yet we still throw things away. We live in such a different way than them.","p022","p048",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
7326,347,303,6,"Person 1","I a gree. Have you ever donated to charities with these causes","p022","p048",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
7327,347,303,7,"Person 2","I honestly have not and that's only because I'm skeptical on whether it's really helping or not yanno","p022","p048",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.6667
7328,347,303,8,"Person 1","I agree. They could be going to the wrong places. Then sadly, there really is no other way to help","p022","p048",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
7329,347,303,9,"Person 2","Yes. The charities are usually ran by companies and they have to pay their employees and so it just makes you wonder where that money is coming from. And even traveling to these countries is so hard to do but that's the only way I see us helping.","p022","p048",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
7330,347,303,10,"Person 1","I hope that these people do actually get help and are not left dying","p022","p048",2,1,2.6667,2
7331,347,303,11,"Person 2","I do too. It's hard to know if it's improved in the last decade or if it is really getting worse.","p022","p048",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
7332,347,303,12,"Person 1","Yeah and all we can do is hear what is going on in the news but not actually know what is going on.","p022","p048",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7333,347,303,13,"Person 2","Most definitely. You can't always believe what they are saying in the news. You almost want to hope they are lying in these situations.","p022","p048",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
7334,347,303,14,"Person 1","I wonder if any children from that area actually make it out and get a decent living","p022","p048",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
7335,347,303,15,"Person 2","That would be something. You would really have a story and strength if you are able to.","p022","p048",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7336,347,303,16,"Person 1","I agree. Let's hope it does happen though","p022","p048",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
7337,347,303,17,"Person 2","Yes. I can't imagine the people who would want these people to go hungry.","p022","p048",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
7338,347,303,18,"Person 1","Yup! It was nice talking to you. bye","p022","p048",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333

7373,347,305,12,"Person 1","seriously.  It honestly annoys me to hear people complaining so much about america.  I get that we have our issues, but you have plenty of food and can express your opinion freely and walk around without worrying about  being bombed randomly all the time.","p029","p024",2.6667,0.3333,2,2.6667

7400,48,306,19,"Person 2","I agree. I hope that some peace can come there soon. It is just so hard to see so much violence going on around the world in places like Syria.","p024","p011",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
7401,48,306,20,"Person 1","its crazy what bad humans can do in this world","p024","p011",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
7402,48,306,21,"Person 2","I really think in lots of ways we want the same things for ourselves and our families we just fight over things that really should not be fought over in my opinion. I think that you might need to do something according to the instructions.","p024","p011",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
7403,48,306,22,"Person 1","what do you mean?","p024","p011",1,1,0.6667,1
7404,48,306,23,"Person 2","I think we've had a good conversation don't you? It's been great chatting with you. Bye!","p024","p011",1.6667,0,1.3333,1
7405,48,306,24,"Person 1","bye","p024","p011",1,1,0.6667,1
7406,48,306,25,"Person 2","bye bye","p024","p011",1,1,0.6667,1
7451,48,308,0,"Person 1","HI. Isn't it unfortunate that this is happening to people in 2019?","p047","p008",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
7452,48,308,1,"Person 2","It's straight up depressing.","p047","p008",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
7453,48,308,2,"Person 1","I know I can't believe people would leave their parents and elderly behind.","p047","p008",2.3333,2,3,3.3333
7454,48,308,3,"Person 2","I mean, survival instinct is probably a hell of a drug. But I concur. I just picture some sweet old man and his wife in the middle of a warzone, starving themselves to feed the kids.","p047","p008",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
7455,48,308,4,"Person 1","Yeah. I understand logically why that would be an option but I just can't imagine it. And especially when there's a food and fuel shortage.","p047","p008",2.3333,2,2.6667,3
7456,48,308,5,"Person 2","I can hardly imagine working my entire life to provide for my loved ones only to watch it all get flushed down the toilet like that.","p047","p008",2.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
7457,48,308,6,"Person 1","Yes. And then not having access to basic medications. There seems to not even be a safe zone for doctors to treat anyone.","p047","p008",2,2,3.3333,2.6667
7458,48,308,7,"Person 2","Right? I feel like medical areas are a generally respected safe zone by both sides, but then again I've never been in war so.","p047","p008",2,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
7459,48,308,8,"Person 1","True. Seems like it would be. I haven't kept up to date with this story but I wonder how these people are getting into Turkey. Are they crossing illegally or being given refuge? I'm not sure.","p047","p008",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
7460,48,308,9,"Person 2","I hadn't even heard of this story before this HIT. Ignorance is bliss and all that.","p047","p008",2,1,1.3333,2.6667
7461,48,308,10,"Person 1","Yeah I hadn't either. I knew of the Syria crisis in general but thought people were being taken to countries in Europe.","p047","p008",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7462,48,308,11,"Person 2","Same here - knew about Syria in general but not really anything specific. Except maybe that Canada I think was taking some refugees?","p047","p008",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7463,48,308,12,"Person 1","I don't know either. I researched quickly and see why the doctors are fleeing. A hospital was bombed two weeks back. Crazy. We're such a violent lot of animals.","p047","p008",2,2,2.6667,3.3333
7464,48,308,13,"Person 2","Hard agreement there. It's so nuts, like why? If they're in the hospital, they're not coming after anyone. It's horrific.","p047","p008",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
7465,48,308,14,"Person 1","Evil. I can't think of a better word. I guess they're using phone data to chat through Skype. Surprised no one's blown up the cell towers.","p047","p008",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
7466,48,308,15,"Person 2","Yeesh, because the people in Aleppos aren't deprived enough already. I mean there's always more to lose. I came here for a good time and now I'm sad.","p047","p008",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
7467,48,308,16,"Person 1","Same. I was making good money and this story puts a downer on the day. I hope more countries in that area take some people in. I can't believe other Middle Eastern countries aren't taking refugees. Or I assume they're not since I never hear about it.","p047","p008",2.3333,2,2,3
7468,48,308,17,"Person 2","Literally the only thing I have really heard about Syrian refugees is the polarizing arguments on why the US should/shouldn't take them in. Whoever wrote that article is doing good work getting that information out.","p047","p008",2,0,1.3333,2.6667
7469,48,308,18,"Person 1","Yes! That's all you hear about here is people squawking about taking those on the brink of death and/or starvation in. It's embarrassing sometimes. People don't realize it doesn't have to be forever. Just maybe until the war is over and the area is rebuilt.","p047","p008",3,2,2.3333,3.3333
7470,48,308,19,"Person 2","It is embarrassing! Like look around yourself and see how good you have it! There's so much excess, why is it so hard to share your space with people who are terrified and trying to find sanctuary?","p047","p008",3.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
7471,48,308,20,"Person 1","I think it's easy to have that mentality if you've never seen it up close and personal for some people. I have some people like that in my family and I know their opinions would change if they area had to stay in such a place for any period of time. I think this is our last turn?","p047","p008",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
7472,48,308,21,"Person 2","Haha, roundabout way to end with the whole \"ignorance is bliss\" theme. And all that. So then you start with a bye and I say bye after that, right?","p047","p008",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7473,48,308,22,"Person 1","Laugh out loud yeah. Ok, thanks for the chat. Bye.","p047","p008",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
7474,48,308,23,"Person 2","You have to do it in all lower case, haha. It's been good talking to you, too!","p047","p008",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
7475,48,308,24,"Person 1","bye","p047","p008",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7476,48,308,25,"Person 2","bye","p047","p008",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7477,48,309,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the article?","p009","p066",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
7478,48,309,1,"Person 2","I thought it was tragic","p009","p066",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
7479,48,309,2,"Person 1","I agree, very sad","p009","p066",3,2,2.6667,2
7480,48,309,3,"Person 2","I cant imagine working your whole life for you kids and grandchildren just to watch it go up in flames like that","p009","p066",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
7481,48,309,4,"Person 1","I know, it would be so awful","p009","p066",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
7482,48,309,5,"Person 2","What hit you the most from the article","p009","p066",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
7483,48,309,6,"Person 1","The part about them rationing food","p009","p066",1.6667,2,3,1.6667
7484,48,309,7,"Person 2","yeah it would be miserable to have to ration food like that","p009","p066",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
7485,48,309,8,"Person 1","and just living that way while being so elderly","p009","p066",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.3333
7486,48,309,9,"Person 2","I worked in an old folks home for a while and its sad even there, I cant imagine many of those people trying to make it on their own again in those circumstances","p009","p066",2.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
7487,48,309,10,"Person 1","yeah neither can I, it must be terrible","p009","p066",3,2,2.3333,1.6667
7488,48,309,11,"Person 2","I understand fleeing to another country with your family, but I can't imagine having to leave behind a parent/grandparent like that","p009","p066",3,2,3.3333,2
7489,48,309,12,"Person 1","That would be terrible I dont know if i could do it","p009","p066",3,2,3,2
7490,48,309,13,"Person 2","Not just the elderly either, people with disabilities would probably be left behind as well","p009","p066",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
7491,48,309,14,"Person 1","yeah i cant even imagine@","p009","p066",3,2,2.3333,1.3333
7492,48,309,15,"Person 2","Do you know if that war is still going on? I haven't kept up with current events as much as I should.","p009","p066",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
7493,48,309,16,"Person 1","Theres always something going on over there unfortunately","p009","p066",2,2,1.3333,1.3333
7494,48,309,17,"Person 2","it does seem that way. I wonder if the elderly would want to leave too if given the option, or if they felt like they should stay because its what they have known","p009","p066",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
7495,48,309,18,"Person 1","yeah i could see that happening as well","p009","p066",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
7496,48,309,19,"Person 2","Well I hope that my family never has to see anything like that or make those decisions - off topic but do you want to try to go for 15 or 20 turns for the bonus?","p009","p066",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
7497,48,309,20,"Person 1","sure, but i do need to leave here soon!","p009","p066",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7498,48,309,21,"Person 2","actually I need to go, thanks for the conversation, bye","p009","p066",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
7499,48,309,22,"Person 1","goodbye!","p009","p066",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1
7500,48,309,23,"Person 2","goodbye","p009","p066",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7501,48,310,0,"Person 1","What did you think of this article?","p010","p048",0.6667,1,1,1.3333
7502,48,310,1,"Person 2","It's always so hard to imagine these countries and the struggle they are experiencing. I wouldn't want to be in their situation and count my blessings. What about you?>","p010","p048",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
7503,48,310,2,"Person 1","Same here.   All I can picture was the 70 year old man saddened and weak.   Everything he worked so hard for was gone and he had to stay.","p010","p048",3.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
7504,48,310,3,"Person 2","Exactly. I can't even imagine. Especially that old to have lost it all.","p010","p048",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
7505,48,310,4,"Person 1","I know.   I volunteer at an at-risk youth center in the city.   The majority of the kids I work with are refugee families.   We have no idea how blessed we are.","p010","p048",2.3333,0.6667,3.6667,3.6667
7506,48,310,5,"Person 2","Yes that's very true. It's hard for me to imagine. Youth these days have it so much more difficult than us.","p010","p048",2,1.6667,3,2.6667
7507,48,310,6,"Person 1","These youth are from Syria, Jordan, Sudan, Ethiopia.   They all came from the countries this story is conveying.","p010","p048",2,1,3,2
7508,48,310,7,"Person 2","Oh wow. That hits home for you then. I just can't even imagine how they feel. I'm sure you deal with the anger and sadness from them","p010","p048",3.3333,1,3,2.6667
7509,48,310,8,"Person 1","Not so much anger but more TBI symptoms.   I had to take a lot of classes to understand it in order to be able to work with them.   No one know except them the impact of years of bombing and homes being burned how that permanently affects children.","p010","p048",2.6667,2,3.6667,3.6667
7510,48,310,9,"Person 2","That's true. I can't imagine wanting to really want to talk about it, especially here in the US. I feel like it's such mixed emotions and opinions.","p010","p048",2.6667,1.3333,3,3
7511,48,310,10,"Person 1","Another dark part of refugees relocating is there is no one keeping these families together.   Some are here in US, the same family has members in Canada or Brazil.   It's bazaar.","p010","p048",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
7512,48,310,11,"Person 2","Oh wow. That is bazaar. That just makes matters so much harder. The system is unfortunately not the best.","p010","p048",2.3333,1.6667,3,2
7513,48,310,12,"Person 1","To me everything is simple.   Example:   US can take 2000 refugees this year.   Why not take a whole family at a time to get to the 2000 ?   It's not rocket science.   My imagination is are they saying you, you, you get to go???","p010","p048",2.3333,2,3.3333,3
7514,48,310,13,"Person 2","Yeah, just completely random selections to make it seem unbiased maybe? I don't know enough about it apparently because I had no idea it was like that.","p010","p048",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
7515,48,310,14,"Person 1","Well I didn't either until I started volunteering.   Most come here with absolutely nothing especially shoes.  They walked barefoot for smiles and smiles.   When they finally get here, they have flip flops that were given to them.   I live in Colorado so we have 9 months of snow each year.   I head up a Christmas Shoe sponsorship where families adopt a child and the main purpose is to give them a sturdy pair of athletic shoes.    If they want to give something else, perfectly fine.   We give photos to the families and their children get involved after they see their sweet faces.","p010","p048",3.3333,0.6667,4,4
7516,48,310,15,"Person 2","Oh wow. That's so tough but so awesome about the sponsorship. It makes it a tad better.","p010","p048",2.6667,0,3,2
7517,48,310,16,"Person 1","Yes so far I have 560 sponsors.   I still need 20 more for kids and 100 for the adults.  I'll get it.      If you haven't worked as a volunteer to help these folks, I highly recommend.   The parents cannot speak English so the children never have anyone to help them at home.   Tutoring brings them joy as well as you feel like you helped them.","p010","p048",2.6667,0,3.6667,3.6667
7518,48,310,17,"Person 2","That's so great that you can help them. It's great to hear that people are actually putting valiant efforts into changing something about the struggles. You don't hear it often. I'll definitely look up the organization. What city is it based out of?","p010","p048",3,0,3.3333,2.6667
7519,48,310,18,"Person 1","It's most everywhere that has a city.  Mine is in Denver - but the refugees are located in most all cities in the US.    It was so nice chatting with you about this topic.   Blessings to you and your family,  goodbye","p010","p048",2,0,3,3
7520,48,310,19,"Person 2","Thanks again. goodbye.","p010","p048",1.3333,0,1.6667,1.6667
7521,291,311,0,"Person 1","Well I thought this was a very avoidable tragedy.  What did you think?","p029","p022",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
7522,291,311,1,"Person 2","Definitely. I just feel terrible for the dog.","p029","p022",3,2,4,2
7523,291,311,2,"Person 1","Yeah, it was just totally helpless in the car to suffer.","p029","p022",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
7524,291,311,3,"Person 2","So do you think the officer should be punished even though it was an accident?","p029","p022",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
7525,291,311,4,"Person 1","Yeah for sure, I do.  It was an accident but she should have known and remembered the dog was there.  she was resonsible for it.  what do you think?","p029","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
7526,291,311,5,"Person 2","I agree. Although accidents happen and i honestly don't think she should be punished for it though","p029","p022",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
7527,291,311,6,"Person 1","Yeah maybe reprimanded and banned from handling any more dogs","p029","p022",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
7528,291,311,7,"Person 2","That's a good enough punishment. I have a dog myself and i can't even begin to imagine how i would feel if this were to happen to me","p029","p022",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,3
7529,291,311,8,"Person 1","Yeah no doubt, I don't have dogs but still I would think it's like your children, like you need to know when they're with you or not","p029","p022",3.6667,1,2.6667,3
7530,291,311,9,"Person 2","Yeah overall, it was just very tragic and sad.","p029","p022",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
7531,291,311,10,"Person 1","Yeah totally, what is up with people leaving living beings in their cars!?","p029","p022",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
7532,291,311,11,"Person 2","Yeah! I've been hearing so many stories of babies being locked in cars out in the heat. It's crazy","p029","p022",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
7533,291,311,12,"Person 1","It is absolutely crazy!  It's like there's a story or more every single week","p029","p022",3.6667,1.3333,3,2
7534,291,311,13,"Person 2","Yeah, at least there are decent people around to break the windows.","p029","p022",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
7535,291,311,14,"Person 1","Yeah sometimes there are","p029","p022",2,1,1.3333,1
7536,291,311,15,"Person 2","What would you have done if you saw the dog in the car?","p029","p022",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
7537,291,311,16,"Person 1","I would have called 911, how about you","p029","p022",2,1,2.6667,1.6667
7538,291,311,17,"Person 2","I think i would have just broken the window lol","p029","p022",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
7539,291,311,18,"Person 1","lol I hear you, I'm pregnant and have a baby, two toddlers, and another child so I don't really want to be smashing glass right now but I'd definitely call for help","p029","p022",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,3.6667
7540,291,311,19,"Person 2","Oh wow, calling for help would definitely be the better choice for you. Well it was nice talking to you!","p029","p022",2.3333,0,2.3333,1.6667
7541,291,311,20,"Person 1","You too, have a great day, bye!","p029","p022",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7542,291,311,21,"Person 2","bye","p029","p022",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7543,291,312,0,"Person 1","I found the article to be very sad, and anger-inducing. How about you?","p012","p067",3.3333,2,3.3333,3
7544,291,312,1,"Person 2","Yes, dogs shouldn't be left in cars like that, there should be more responsibility taken here.","p012","p067",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
7545,291,312,2,"Person 1","Honestly, I feel like the officer should be charged with involuntary manslaughter. They consider police dogs to be police officers. I feel it's important to set a precedent here.","p012","p067",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
7546,291,312,3,"Person 2","That kind of makes sense, I was not sure whether to believe they suffered consequences at all honestly","p012","p067",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
7547,291,312,4,"Person 1","They were definitely vague. I think they were on suspended leave, un-paid. But you know, that's pretty messed up if they're not being charged with anything. I feel like negligence like that needs to be severely cracked down on.","p012","p067",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
7548,291,312,5,"Person 2","yeah, I wonder how realistic that even is though, the consequences always seem vague and small","p012","p067",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7549,291,312,6,"Person 1","It's unfortunate, but you're right. That's why I feel like they should be charged with the murder of a police officer. If a criminal were to shoot a police dog, they would be charged with murdering an officer. But a cop gets away with leaving the dog in the cop car? I mean, ugh. That's really aggravating.","p012","p067",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7550,291,312,7,"Person 2","would they really be charged with that? That definitely seems hypocritical","p012","p067",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
7551,291,312,8,"Person 1","I hope they're charged with involuntary manslaughter of a police officer. I swear, if you set a harsh punishment, you'll deter people, and make them think twice. Same goes for anyone leaving anything/anyone in a car.","p012","p067",3,2,3,2.3333
7552,291,312,9,"Person 2","That makes sense, but the difficulty would be convincing the local prosecutor to take on the case, and the rest of the police force to be willing to provide evidence","p012","p067",2,1.6667,2,2
7553,291,312,10,"Person 1","You would think that there shouldn't be much evidence to provide. I don't think it would go that far, unfortunately, but I feel like it should. If it were a legit  human, I wonder what would happen from there.","p012","p067",2,1.6667,3,2.3333
7554,291,312,11,"Person 2","hm, I'm not sure. In any case there should also be procedures for making sure that doesn't happen in the first place","p012","p067",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
7555,291,312,12,"Person 1","There should be. I just hate hearing stories about deaths caused by cars due to negligence. I would love to see that cop do ten years for the death of that police dog. Sorry, this story gets me steamed.","p012","p067",3,2,3,2.3333
7556,291,312,13,"Person 2","that's a lot of years, but perhaps he deserves it.","p012","p067",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.3333
7557,291,312,14,"Person 1","I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with.","p012","p067",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
7558,291,312,15,"Person 2","I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk","p012","p067",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
7559,291,312,16,"Person 1","Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue.","p012","p067",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
7560,291,312,17,"Person 2","no, I think you're being very reasonable. Yeah maybe they would be more careful. They definitely should be.","p012","p067",1.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
7561,291,312,18,"Person 1","I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end. But yeah, hopefully we can deter behavior like that in the end.","p012","p067",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,3.3333
7562,291,312,19,"Person 2","ideally it would be possible. The goal should be preventing things like this from happening to begin with however that can be done most effectively","p012","p067",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
7563,291,312,20,"Person 1","Right. I think if you set down strict rules about procedures with partners/K9 units, then, hopefully, people will pay more attention. Maybe up the punishment for this situation, and they'll definitely be more careful.","p012","p067",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
7564,291,312,21,"Person 2","That makes sense. Maybe there could be specific training too? I'm not sure what the best procedure is for making sure dogs are safe in cars in all situations","p012","p067",1.6667,1,2.3333,2
7565,291,312,22,"Person 1","Yeah, hopefully all of that is already in place. If not, then it should be. Well, I can't think of anything else. My rant steamed out ha ha","p012","p067",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
7566,291,312,23,"Person 2","makes sense. Alright, nice talking to you, goodbye","p012","p067",1.6667,0,2,1.6667
7567,291,312,24,"Person 1","goodbye","p012","p067",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7568,291,313,0,"Person 1","Hello","p010","p062",1,1,0.3333,1
7569,291,313,1,"Person 2","Hi, I feel awful about this story.  What a terrible thing to happen to a police dog.","p010","p062",3,2,3.6667,2.6667
7570,291,313,2,"Person 1","It is so very terrible.    Between people leaving their kids in a car and animals, a greater punishment is needed for it to stop.","p010","p062",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
7571,291,313,3,"Person 2","I wonder what happened.  If it was willful negligence or just a really \"bad accident\" as the sheriff said.","p010","p062",2.3333,1,2.6667,2
7572,291,313,4,"Person 1","I just do not think you leave a large animal in a vehicle and never see it or it barking continuously.","p010","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
7573,291,313,5,"Person 2","I agree, but I wonder what the procedure is for taking the dog out of the car.  I mean, there must be times when the cops have to get out to attend to something and have to leave the dog inside.","p010","p062",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
7574,291,313,6,"Person 1","Where was he for 38 hours that he would not have come back to the car?  I agree.  Police have procedures for everything.","p010","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7575,291,313,7,"Person 2","Wait, was it 38 hours for the Arkansas one?  The other one was 5, I think.  But yeah, if it was 38 hours then he must have just forgotten the dog in the car, which is absurd.","p010","p062",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
7576,291,313,8,"Person 1","Oh I thought the dog was 5 years old and he had been a handler for 3 years?","p010","p062",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
7577,291,313,9,"Person 2","Yeah, maybe that was it.  Those numbers are definitely correct that you just mentioned.  I just don't remember how long the dog was in the car.  But I bet that cop is ashamed to show his face at the precinct now (although he's currently on leave).","p010","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7578,291,313,10,"Person 1","It was 38 and I just do not believe you leave him in the car.   With all the media hysteria, he can't hide for sure.","p010","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
7579,291,313,11,"Person 2","Maybe he was punishing the dog or was sick of him or something.   I think those dogs live with their handlers.","p010","p062",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
7580,291,313,12,"Person 1","Sounds like sick of the dog.  Just tie him up outside.   I can't relate honestly","p010","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7581,291,313,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I don't get it, whether it was intentional or unintentional.  That hurts the police force, too.  Those dogs aren't easy to come by and I'm sure the officers love having one on the force.","p010","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
7582,291,313,14,"Person 1","They are not easy to come by.  My son-in-law is a Seal and had difficulty in obtaining well trained dogs","p010","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,3
7583,291,313,15,"Person 2","Yeah, that's part of the reason I said this guy must be ashamed to see his fellow officers.  He just killed a partner, valuable resource and protector of them.","p010","p062",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
7584,291,313,16,"Person 1","Absolutely correct.   I know we are suppose to write 10 sentences each but I am running out of comments","p010","p062",2,1,2,1.3333
7585,291,313,17,"Person 2","Did you ever lose a dog?  I did when I was younger.  She got lost and I dreamed about her every night for a month.  It sucked.","p010","p062",3,1.6667,3,3.3333
7586,291,313,18,"Person 1","I had a dog that we all loved so very much.   His name was Blackie.   We had a visitor and their little boy was \"teasing\" him with a stick and he snipped at him.   My dad said if a dog bites once he will bite again and he gave him away.  I do not know if that is correct but we were devastated.","p010","p062",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,4
7587,291,313,19,"Person 2","Wow, yeah, that would have devastated me.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Dogs certainly become members of the family and it's awful to lose them.","p010","p062",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
7588,291,313,20,"Person 1","Yes it is.   Well according to the instructions I am leaving the chat with a lower case word.  Then you said it lower case and answer the exit question.   It has been a pleasure today.   goodbye","p010","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7589,291,313,21,"Person 2","Yes, nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  goodbye","p010","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7590,291,314,0,"Person 1","i think the owner should be charged","p024","p010",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.3333
7591,291,314,1,"Person 2","I agree - no way you just leave a dog in a car and forget about him.   What a horrible way for the dog to die (:","p024","p010",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
7592,291,314,2,"Person 1","Man imagine the last moments struggling to be cool under all that heat","p024","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,1
7593,291,314,3,"Person 2","Hard for me to even begin to know what that looks like.  There was another case as well","p024","p010",2,2,2.3333,1.3333
7594,291,314,4,"Person 1","yeah this definitely isnt the first case ive read of this!","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
7595,291,314,5,"Person 2","Me either - I don't believe any of the cases where children or animals are left in cars to die is an accident","p024","p010",2.3333,2,2,2
7596,291,314,6,"Person 1","imagine being that arrogant to believe nothing will happen to a living person or animal if you leave them in a hot car","p024","p010",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.3333
7597,291,314,7,"Person 2","It's horrendous.   Absolutely nothing is done for the most of them.   It's as if children's lives mean absolutely nothing.   Common sentences are community service are 18 months in jail with 6 mos suspended etc.","p024","p010",3,2,2.6667,1
7598,291,314,8,"Person 1","jesus thats just terrible. someone could actually want to kill their child because of whatever reason and just leave them in a hot car and they know the police would turn it to a simple accident! how crazy is that","p024","p010",3.6667,2,3,1.3333
7599,291,314,9,"Person 2","It's very crazy.   It makes me so mad every time I hear nothing has been done.   It's the same with children that are killed in violence.   What's the difference between a child and an adult when it's willful?","p024","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7600,291,314,10,"Person 1","so crazy its hard to believe that its real life sometimes with these laws","p024","p010",2.6667,2,2,1
7601,291,314,11,"Person 2","Agreed.    Harming animals intentionally is a psychopath in the making","p024","p010",3,2,2.3333,1
7602,291,314,12,"Person 1","they are already psychopaths probably tbh","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1.6667,1
7603,291,314,13,"Person 2","I agree.   It seems like the world has changed so much but it probably hasn't.   We just have 24/7 news coverage on a loop.","p024","p010",2,1.6667,1.6667,1
7604,291,314,14,"Person 1","yeah and with social media a racist rant or a violent killing is caputred on video and posted within seconds","p024","p010",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
7605,291,314,15,"Person 2","Social media is a dark place.   This upcoming generation of children are being seriously harmed and parents are clueless","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1.6667,1.3333
7606,291,314,16,"Person 1","exactly. will you or do you let your kids use social media?","p024","p010",2,1,1,1
7607,291,314,17,"Person 2","I did not let my daughter have a phone until she was a freshman in college.   My daughter is not allowing her two daughters/my granddaughters have it until then either.   She is considering a flip phone for home use only that she can only call on -  nothing else.  Proud of her for that.","p024","p010",2.6667,0,2.3333,3.3333
7608,291,314,18,"Person 1","that is a great way to do it. I will be doing the same its the only way to go.","p024","p010",2,0.6667,0.6667,1.6667
7609,291,314,19,"Person 2","Absolutely.   She currently is running a chapter for parents to see what all psychologists have already reported.   Their frontal cortex is not read to see what you see.   You can't unsee it.    Kids are committing suicide because of bullying.   They are all obsessed with \"friends\" likes and thinking what is posted is their real life.   It's all a fraud","p024","p010",3,2,2,3
7610,291,314,20,"Person 1","yeah I personally have a niece who cut her wrists because she was bullied online. She no longer is allowed to have a phone because of that. My sister messed up letting her use the phone in the first place.","p024","p010",3,2,2.6667,3.3333
7611,291,314,21,"Person 2","I am so sorry to hear that - I hope she's doing better.   Heck, even as a middle aged person you see photos of a party or something and think why wasn't I invited.   I can't even imagine what a kid would think","p024","p010",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
7612,291,314,22,"Person 1","Kids just cant handle it at that age it becomes too much. I'm definitely taking your advice when my kids are of age and give them a flip phone. Better to be safe than sorry with social media! Its been a great talk. Have a great day! bye","p024","p010",2,0.6667,2.3333,2
7613,291,314,23,"Person 2","same here.   goodbye","p024","p010",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1
7614,291,315,0,"Person 1","hey thoughts on the article?","p068","p067",0.6667,1,0.3333,1.3333
7615,291,315,1,"Person 2","hi I thought it was kind of sad that the dog died","p068","p067",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
7616,291,315,2,"Person 1","I did as well totally preventable","p068","p067",1.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7617,291,315,3,"Person 2","how could they have prevented it","p068","p067",1.3333,1,1,2
7618,291,315,4,"Person 1","better safety and procedures from the handler","p068","p067",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2
7619,291,315,5,"Person 2","yeah that makes sense, perhaps also better oversight","p068","p067",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
7620,291,315,6,"Person 1","True maybe this will make them come up with better ones","p068","p067",1.6667,0.3333,2,2
7621,291,315,7,"Person 2","well I mean, that there is more accountability for the wellbeing of the dog. Like some impartial person who checks","p068","p067",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
7622,291,315,8,"Person 1","I agree I think I can see both sides of it just so sad","p068","p067",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
7623,291,315,9,"Person 2","yeah its really sad, the poor dog, had nothing to do with it","p068","p067",3,2,3,2.6667
7624,291,315,10,"Person 1","animals are so fragile an innocent stories like this are just so troubling","p068","p067",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
7625,291,315,11,"Person 2","I don't know if they were right to characterize it as an accident, doesn't seem like the right word","p068","p067",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
7626,291,315,12,"Person 1","True maybe a more thorough invesitgation should be done further then them trying to cover there butts","p068","p067",2,1,2,2.3333
7627,291,315,13,"Person 2","I'm pretty sure it takes a lot of time and effort to train drug dogs","p068","p067",1.6667,0.3333,2,2.6667
7628,291,315,14,"Person 1","true that","p068","p067",1.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7629,291,315,15,"Person 2","\"paid administrative leave\" see that phrase too much","p068","p067",2,2,2.6667,1.6667
7630,291,315,16,"Person 1","sorry i meant to say true that is why i cant understand why he would do it on purpose i thought these dogs become like there partner, but also what a big thing to just forget as an accident","p068","p067",2,2,2.6667,2.3333
7631,291,315,17,"Person 2","oh, I didn't mean it was on purpose, just that, accidents are different from negligence","p068","p067",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
7632,291,315,18,"Person 1","Oh yes I see that I wish there was more background provided as so many factors can tell this story just lefting piecing it together in our heads","p068","p067",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2
7633,291,315,19,"Person 2","yeah not a lot of info to go on","p068","p067",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7634,291,315,20,"Person 1","it was nice chatting! bye","p068","p067",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667

7636,39,316,0,"Person 1","What did you think about the article?","p029","p024",1,1,0,1
7637,39,316,1,"Person 2","It was pretty interesting to read that. What do you think?","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
7638,39,316,2,"Person 1","I was a little unclear on a few things.  Why exactly was the government sniper out there shooting the wolf, did you catch that?","p029","p024",2,1,1.6667,2
7639,39,316,3,"Person 2","I think I read that too. Its hard to understand that part. Why do you think he was there","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
7640,39,316,4,"Person 1","I really am not sure.  Like if he had a valid reason, like maybe the wolves were terrorizing the public or threatening people then I could understand it.  If he was just randomly there shooting wolves for fun that seems uncool.","p029","p024",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
7641,39,316,5,"Person 2","It seems a lot of people just shoot animals for fun nowadays.","p029","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
7642,39,316,6,"Person 1","Yeah it does, and a wolf seems like a random thing to want to kill for fun.  You can't even eat the meat.","p029","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
7643,39,316,7,"Person 2","Thats interesting to learn didn't know wolf meat is something you can't eat. You learn something new everyday.","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7644,39,316,8,"Person 1","Well maybe you can eat it?  I've never heard of people eating it, though.  Like people where I Live hunt dear for fun and eat the meat.","p029","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
7645,39,316,9,"Person 2","Deer meat seems like it would be tasty to be honest although I've never had it. What do you think about hunting overall?","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1,2.3333
7646,39,316,10,"Person 1","It's huge where I live.  I am ok with it if there is a purpose and it is a species like deer that is very populous and needs control.  And you're going to eat the meat and use the parts.  Hunting just to kill things like a giraffe for a trophy or an endangered species is unacceptable to me.  What do you think?","p029","p024",2,1,2.6667,3
7647,39,316,11,"Person 2","yeah like the millionaire poachers who just go to Africa to kill Lions and other animals for the thrill of it. They are already rich and do it as a hobby. Thats terrible.","p029","p024",2.6667,2,3,2
7648,39,316,12,"Person 1","Yeah I think that is terrible too.  And post these pictures of it online glorifying their kill.  How sick.","p029","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
7649,39,316,13,"Person 2","yeah like that doctor that posted that picture of the animal he killed a whlle back. Thats sickening","p029","p024",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
7650,39,316,14,"Person 1","Yeah I think I remember the one you are referencing.  It made national news.","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1,1.6667
7651,39,316,15,"Person 2","Yeah I think I saw it on the news. What do you think should be done about those type of people","p029","p024",1.3333,1.3333,0.3333,1.3333
7652,39,316,16,"Person 1","Legislation would have to be changed.  There would need to be laws banning that type of hunting for sport.  I would support something like that, although it would be very difficult to categorize all the different types of animals.  What do you think","p029","p024",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
7653,39,316,17,"Person 2","I think creating laws that go against that type of behavior is the first step the problem is money talks and these rich poachers would try their hardest to stop it.","p029","p024",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
7654,39,316,18,"Person 1","Yeah I can't see that ever passing.  Well it has been interesting talking to you, I hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye","p029","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
7655,39,316,19,"Person 2","bye","p029","p024",1.3333,1,0.3333,1
7656,39,317,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about this article?","p073","p068",0.3333,1.3333,0.3333,1
7657,39,317,1,"Person 2","It makes me so sad anythign involving animals being killed hits my heart","p073","p068",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
7658,39,317,2,"Person 1","Yeah, I agree, especially after the poor guy traveled over 700 miles. He had no idea what he was heading into.","p073","p068",2,2,3.6667,2
7659,39,317,3,"Person 2","And he even escaped one killing field so sad","p073","p068",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
7660,39,317,4,"Person 1","I wonder why there is a federal program to kill the wolves.","p073","p068",2,1.3333,2,2
7661,39,317,5,"Person 2","It might be there a danger in those areas to livestock and people","p073","p068",0.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7662,39,317,6,"Person 1","Yeah, that makes sense. I still don't even like to think about it.","p073","p068",2,2,2,1.6667
7663,39,317,7,"Person 2","yeah it brakes my heart he just wanted a new life it seems","p073","p068",2.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
7664,39,317,8,"Person 1","He was probably run out of other areas by other wolves claiming the territory. It is so sad, his fears were probably of other male wolves.","p073","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
7665,39,317,9,"Person 2","that is horrible i am glad those groups are fighting for animals like them","p073","p068",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
7666,39,317,10,"Person 1","Yeah, it's really hard to think about though, because you can also feel for the animals that the wolves are killing. And if they don't kill any of the wolves, they may become even a bigger threat. It seems animals are being hurt either way.","p073","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7667,39,317,11,"Person 2","I agree but i guess i like natural process better then the government playing god","p073","p068",1.3333,1.3333,2,2
7668,39,317,12,"Person 1","I wonder if people can legally kill them there. It might be better if the government controls it all than putting it in the hands of the ranchers.","p073","p068",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
7669,39,317,13,"Person 2","yeah i can see that if it was more controlled during a certain period of time","p073","p068",1,1,1.6667,1.3333
7670,39,317,14,"Person 1","I feel like when I'm watching a nature show and everything is nice and all the animals are fine and then some predator comes in and tries to catch one of the animals. I understand it has to happen, but I don't want to see it or even think about it.","p073","p068",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
7671,39,317,15,"Person 2","Exactly on one hand you know it has to happen but on the other you feel that wolf as you or your family and just feel bad for it","p073","p068",2,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
7672,39,317,16,"Person 1","Well hopefully you can forget about this and have a great day!","p073","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7673,39,317,17,"Person 2","yes i totally agree think about positive things!","p073","p068",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7674,39,317,18,"Person 1","Nice talking to you!","p073","p068",1.3333,0.3333,2,1.3333
7675,39,317,19,"Person 2","you two thank you!","p073","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7676,39,317,20,"Person 1","bye","p073","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
7677,39,317,21,"Person 2","bye","p073","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
7678,39,318,0,"Person 1","What happened to the wolf is so terrible. It makes me sad.","p022","p016",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
7679,39,318,1,"Person 2","Yeah. I can't believe it was killed by an actual sniper; that's nuts.","p022","p016",3.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
7680,39,318,2,"Person 1","I wonder if the sniper will get punished for this.","p022","p016",1.6667,1,3,1.6667
7681,39,318,3,"Person 2","I don't know; it sounded like it was kind of their job, so probably it'd just be the organization.","p022","p016",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
7682,39,318,4,"Person 1","I just can't believe people can kill an animal like this and be okay with it.","p022","p016",2,2,2.3333,2
7683,39,318,5,"Person 2","Especially since it seemed like the wolf wasn't hurting anybody!","p022","p016",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
7684,39,318,6,"Person 1","Exactly. The wolf probably has a family waiting for it as well.","p022","p016",1.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
7685,39,318,7,"Person 2","Yeah. It's kind of funny; I was just listening to a podcast yesterday about how we actually need more wolves in the US bc we messed up the ecosystem.","p022","p016",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
7686,39,318,8,"Person 1","Oh wow, that's interesting. What do you think of people that hunt for fun?","p022","p016",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
7687,39,318,9,"Person 2","I honestly don't get it, myself. I mean, I understand if you need food or something, but just doing it for fun...","p022","p016",2,1.6667,2,2
7688,39,318,10,"Person 1","Yeah.. it just seems so cruel. Especially people that take pictures of the animal's body afterwards. So inhumane","p022","p016",4.3333,2,4,2
7689,39,318,11,"Person 2","The stuffed ones they hang on the walls are the ones I really don't like. It just seems... blegh.","p022","p016",2.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
7690,39,318,12,"Person 1","That's just disturbing on so many levels!","p022","p016",3.6667,2,4,2.3333
7691,39,318,13,"Person 2","It's biting us, though. Bc of the lower wolf population there's a ton of deer, which means more ticks, which has resulted in a massive spike in lyme disease over the past 20 years. All because we killed the wolves.","p022","p016",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
7692,39,318,14,"Person 1","I never even thought of it like that but it seems like a big problem. I wonder what people can do to help.","p022","p016",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
7693,39,318,15,"Person 2","I bet there's some kind of petition or bill people could lobby for. Like through a wildlife conservation?","p022","p016",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
7694,39,318,16,"Person 1","I might have to look that up later. I think hunting overall should be banned. I don't see the reason for it","p022","p016",2,1.6667,3,2.3333
7695,39,318,17,"Person 2","Yeah. Like I said, if you gotta hunt to eat, fine. But death shouldn't be a sport.","p022","p016",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7696,39,318,18,"Person 1","Agreed. It was nice talking to you!","p022","p016",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
7697,39,318,19,"Person 2","It was nice talking to you too! It's funny, I was thinking about the 700 miles thing. It sounds like so much, but humans travel about 70,000 miles in their lifetime. Poor wolf. :(","p022","p016",3,1,3,2
7698,39,318,20,"Person 1",":( Let's hope things will improve in the future for animals. Bye","p022","p016",2.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
7699,39,318,21,"Person 2","bye!","p022","p016",1.3333,0.6667,0.6667,1.3333
7700,39,318,22,"Person 1","bye","p022","p016",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7701,39,319,0,"Person 1","What did you think about the article?","p058","p030",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
7702,39,319,1,"Person 2","I wasn't aware that there were people employed to exterminate wildlife here in the contiguous U.S.","p058","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,2
7703,39,319,2,"Person 1","neither was i, they seem to be doing a lot too, killing over 3 million wildlife animals in a year","p058","p030",1.6667,1,2,2
7704,39,319,3,"Person 2","I wonder who they are employed by. Anyway, I feel sorry for the poor wolf.","p058","p030",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
7705,39,319,4,"Person 1","i wonder what punishment if any would they receive for killing it","p058","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7706,39,319,5,"Person 2","I highly doubt anyone will suffer any consequences, but I would assume a verbal reprimand at most.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
7707,39,319,6,"Person 1","yeah, i feel like the article makes it out to be a bigger deal than it really is","p058","p030",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
7708,39,319,7,"Person 2","The hyperbole used in the article really doesn't help to curry much sympathy, you're right.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7709,39,319,8,"Person 1","i also wonder how close that wolf was to populated areas, maybe it was killed for safety reasons","p058","p030",2,1,1.3333,1.6667
7710,39,319,9,"Person 2","I know that oil and gas companies will hire exterminators in the far north to keep wild animals away from workers in the wild. I highly doubt it was close to civilization.","p058","p030",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
7711,39,319,10,"Person 1","that makes sense, im sure they had a good reason for killing it","p058","p030",1.3333,1,1,1.6667
7712,39,319,11,"Person 2","Could be, they could have just been having some fun. The fact is it's hard to be empathetic when thousands of innocent domestic animals are thrown into furnaces every day.","p058","p030",2,1,1.3333,2
7713,39,319,12,"Person 1","yeah, i feel like the article was trying to make this out to be some great injustice but it missed its mark.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
7714,39,319,13,"Person 2","Like so many other articles churned out by the modern news media. I think a significant minority are written by AI these days.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
7715,39,319,14,"Person 1","oh absolutely, all generated to get clicks for advertising, even AI generated youtube videos are becoming popular.","p058","p030",2,1.3333,1,1.6667
7716,39,319,15,"Person 2","Really? I don't spend a lot of time on YouTube. Are they entertaining?","p058","p030",1.3333,1,0.6667,2
7717,39,319,16,"Person 1","not really, often times using computer generated voice and clips that are somewhat related but mashed together.","p058","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1,1.3333
7718,39,319,17,"Person 2","Ah, are there any circumstances similar to the one in the article that would excite you emotionally? Endangered animal? Drunken assailant?","p058","p030",2,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
7719,39,319,18,"Person 1","i feel like i've been so desensitized to bad news it's hard to really react to anything anymore, I can't remember the last time Ive seen positive news in the media.","p058","p030",1.6667,2,1.3333,2.6667
7720,39,319,19,"Person 2","I know the feeling. Thanks for chatting. bye","p058","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7721,39,319,20,"Person 1","you too, goodbye","p058","p030",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
7722,39,320,0,"Person 1","Well? What did you think","p022","p048",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7723,39,320,1,"Person 2","Well, I guess it's sad that a wolf died but I feel like there is more to the story that's not mentioned than just someone shooting a wolf...","p022","p048",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
7724,39,320,2,"Person 1","I just feel bad because the wolf has a family ya know","p022","p048",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7725,39,320,3,"Person 2","Not really though. Wolves actually usually separate from their pack when they are looking for a mate and that's what this wolf was doing. It's still sad of course but the wolf may have been near humans and could have actually killed humans.","p022","p048",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
7726,39,320,4,"Person 1","Wow i didn't know that, very interesting. I just feel bad that humans can do such acts.","p022","p048",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
7727,39,320,5,"Person 2","It is scary how easy some people can carry out these tasks.","p022","p048",2,1.6667,3,1.6667
7728,39,320,6,"Person 1"," These tasks should never be easy, they should be hard. The fact that people can do it so easily just disgusts me","p022","p048",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
7729,39,320,7,"Person 2","Well, it is a wild animal that could and probably would have attacked a human if a human was near by. For me, a humans life is far above an animals life.","p022","p048",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7730,39,320,8,"Person 1","They are equal in my opinion. I just love animals too much","p022","p048",2,1,2.6667,3
7731,39,320,9,"Person 2","Well we can agree to disagree. I would never put an animals life above another humans or my own.","p022","p048",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7732,39,320,10,"Person 1","I agree as well. I just think that we should all be loving and not killing.","p022","p048",2.3333,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
7733,39,320,11,"Person 2","Of course but there are many times that it's acceptable in my opinion","p022","p048",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
7734,39,320,12,"Person 1","do you think its acceptable if a lion is attacking you to shoot it?","p022","p048",2,1.3333,1,2
7735,39,320,13,"Person 2","yes of course. 100% do you not?","p022","p048",2.3333,0.6667,1,3
7736,39,320,14,"Person 1","Definitely if my life is on the line , it should be shot","p022","p048",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667
7737,39,320,15,"Person 2","Exactly. Animals are unpredictable unfortunately in any capacity.","p022","p048",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
7738,39,320,16,"Person 1","It's a shame really, animals are so beautiful","p022","p048",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
7739,39,320,17,"Person 2","Yes they are. I think it would hit more at home if maybe it was a dog or cat for me.","p022","p048",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
7740,39,320,18,"Person 1","Exactly. Well it was nice talking to you, bye!","p022","p048",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7741,39,320,19,"Person 2","goodbye.","p022","p048",1,1,0.6667,1
7742,52,321,0,"Person 1","That is depressing how was this man not a citizen yet. Something is wrong with our laws.","p024","p022",3,2,3.6667,1.3333
7743,52,321,1,"Person 2","Seriously! I feel like if you lived in the country for a certain amount of years, you should be a citizen","p024","p022",3.3333,1.3333,3.6667,2
7744,52,321,2,"Person 1","It seems like a joke to be honest hard to believe that there is no law in place to prevent that.","p024","p022",2.3333,2,3,1.3333
7745,52,321,3,"Person 2","Yeah it's just terrible that everything he worked for is just taken away from him.","p024","p022",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
7746,52,321,4,"Person 1","there are far too many stories like this to be honest way too much","p024","p022",1.6667,2,3,1
7747,52,321,5,"Person 2","Yeah, i can't even imagine what the man is going through..","p024","p022",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
7748,52,321,6,"Person 1","Actually a few months back I remember reading about a New York man with Diabetes being deported back to the middle east even though he only spoke english and he ended up dying there on the streets with no health care for his diabetes","p024","p022",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
7749,52,321,7,"Person 2","Wow, yeah there definitely needs to be a law in place to prevent things like this. I feel like if you've lived in the country for at least 10 years and had a job.. you should be eligible to stay","p024","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
7750,52,321,8,"Person 1","yeah it was quite depressing i believe there was a video showing him in the middle east crying and begging to be brought back. Unfortunately it never happened. Hopefully the laws change. I understand we cant take in criminals but what about the ones that never committed a crime and have worked and been here forever.","p024","p022",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
7751,52,321,9,"Person 2","Agree 100%. It's crazy what's happening with our country. People use to look to use as the savior but not anymore.","p024","p022",2.6667,2,3,1.3333
7752,52,321,10,"Person 1","Agree with you on that this country was once all about fighting for a good cause.","p024","p022",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
7753,52,321,11,"Person 2","Hopefully our next President can fix this and we continue to be the great country we once was","p024","p022",2.3333,0,1.6667,1.6667
7754,52,321,12,"Person 1","Yeah I agree on that one!","p024","p022",1.6667,0,2.3333,1.3333
7755,52,321,13,"Person 2","If you were the President, what would be your requirements to stay in the country if you can illegally?","p024","p022",2,1,1,1
7756,52,321,14,"Person 1","work here ten years paying taxes and no big crimes. I understand running a red light isnt a deal killer.","p024","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
7757,52,321,15,"Person 2","Great points, how do you feel about overpopulation in the USA though with all the illegal immigrants","p024","p022",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
7758,52,321,16,"Person 1","well there should be a quota as well to prevent too many people from coming in","p024","p022",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7759,52,321,17,"Person 2","I think we both can agree that the US should go back to how we were regarding immigrants","p024","p022",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
7760,52,321,18,"Person 1","yeah there is no other choice in my opinion","p024","p022",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7761,52,321,19,"Person 2","Well i had a great chat with you! bye","p024","p022",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
7762,52,321,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p022",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7763,52,322,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this situation?","p029","p030",1,1,1,1
7764,52,322,1,"Person 2","The world is a vampire.","p029","p030",2,1.6667,1.3333,1
7765,52,322,2,"Person 1","what do you mean?","p029","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
7766,52,322,3,"Person 2","I mean that from the day you are born until the day that you die the amount of options you have to dictate your own fate shrink substantially.","p029","p030",1.3333,1.6667,2,3
7767,52,322,4,"Person 1","I disagree, I think we have many options every day to control our own fate","p029","p030",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333
7768,52,322,5,"Person 2","We're talking about vastly different periods of time, but you are certainly entitled to your opinion.","p029","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7769,52,322,6,"Person 1","Yes I am.  I'm not sure how you think one's options shrink the older they get, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion too.  So what did you think about the man in the article?","p029","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
7770,52,322,7,"Person 2","Life in modern society is characterized by indoctrination. You are honed as far as your opportunity and ambition to fill a specific role in society will allow and then you are bound to that by the costs of subsistence. There are always exceptions, but this is the reality for most human beings. The man in the article is probably somewhat inured to slings and arrows, but that doesn't make it right to persecute him because of others mistakes.","p029","p030",1.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
7771,52,322,8,"Person 1","I disagree about indoctrination.  We have the freedom to chose our role in the United States of America, unless perhaps you are speaking of a different culture?  Regardless, that is not at all my reality of that or anyone I know, but perhaps it is yours.","p029","p030",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7772,52,322,9,"Person 2","I didn't say we weren't free to choose, I said that as we choose our freedom to navigate outside those choices becomes more limited the more choices you make. You're trying to make this political and missing the point entirely. Do you feel any empathy toward the man in the article?","p029","p030",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.6667
7773,52,322,10,"Person 1","You sound like an intoxicated person to me.  I don't feel much empathy towards him.  He had a rough childhood, but he has had personal responsibility for himself since the age of 18 and he made poor choices.  He could have made sure his papers were correct and up to date.  That was his responsibility.  He chose to break the law, repeatedly.  What do you think about him?","p029","p030",2,2,2.6667,2.6667
7774,52,322,11,"Person 2","It's probably difficult for you consider abstract concepts. I apologize. Do you think that he would have been better off if deported at 18 instead of 41?","p029","p030",2,2,2,1.6667
7775,52,322,12,"Person 1","Yep, maybe so","p029","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7776,52,322,13,"Person 2","Do you believe his children should be deported as well?","p029","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1,1.6667
7777,52,322,14,"Person 1","No","p029","p030",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333
7778,52,322,15,"Person 2","Why not?","p029","p030",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1
7779,52,322,16,"Person 1","They are legal citizens","p029","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
7780,52,322,17,"Person 2","Did you make any assumptions as to what he had been in trouble with the law for?","p029","p030",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
7781,52,322,18,"Person 1","No, it clearly stated that if you read the article.  Goodbye!","p029","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
7782,52,322,19,"Person 2","gotta be lower case, friend bye","p029","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
7783,52,323,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p058","p073",0.6667,1.3333,0.3333,1
7784,52,323,1,"Person 2","It's unbelievable. The poor guy hasn't gotten any breaks.","p058","p073",3.3333,2,3,1
7785,52,323,2,"Person 1","i know right? being deported when you spend your whole life in a country is rough","p058","p073",2.3333,2,2.3333,1
7786,52,323,3,"Person 2","He has just been failed by so many people. It's very sad. And now he has to go live in North Korea? He probably can't even read or speak their language.","p058","p073",2.6667,1.6667,3,1
7787,52,323,4,"Person 1","i believe he was sent to south korea, but yeah, still doesn't make it any better","p058","p073",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1
7788,52,323,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I realized that right after I sent it. Either way though, he is being dropped into a completely foreign culture / language.","p058","p073",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
7789,52,323,6,"Person 1","yeah definitely, its horrible. i mean i get we need an immigration policy, but to deport a guy because he had a few problems with the law when he's been here his whole life is a bit much","p058","p073",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.3333
7790,52,323,7,"Person 2","I totally agree, it seems that newer situations like this will be covered by the Child Citizenship Act, but he was already over 18 at that time so he didn't qualify.","p058","p073",2,1,3,1.3333
7791,52,323,8,"Person 1","i wish the article spoke more on his plans once he gets to south korea. like what does he plan to do there.","p058","p073",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.3333
7792,52,323,9,"Person 2","He probably is hoping to just figure a way to get back to the U.S. to his family.","p058","p073",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1
7793,52,323,10,"Person 1","yeah i imagine so. i dont remember if the article said anything about an appeals process or something he could do to get it overturned.","p058","p073",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
7794,52,323,11,"Person 2","I think in the article they were asking people to call their Congress person and try to get it fixed. Not sure if it's too late for him though.","p058","p073",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
7795,52,323,12,"Person 1","im sure something would be done if it got enough media attention","p058","p073",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.3333
7796,52,323,13,"Person 2","I agree. I doubt that anyone would be against this guy staying in the country. I think it's just a very unfortunate situation.","p058","p073",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
7797,52,323,14,"Person 1","well you never know, im sure some people would definitely think he should be deported, especially after looking at his criminal history.","p058","p073",2,2,2,1.3333
7798,52,323,15,"Person 2","Sadly, you are probably right. I just feel so sad for this guy, to think of him as a toddler being sent to America to be adopted with a bright future. And then for nothing to ever go good for him. It's just too sad. He may not have that criminal history if he had been taken in by loving parents.","p058","p073",3.6667,2,4,1.6667
7799,52,323,16,"Person 1","yeah you're right. and then to be abandoned by the only country he's ever known, leaving behind his pregnant wife and kids. thats just crazy","p058","p073",3,2,3,1
7800,52,323,17,"Person 2","These stories are so depressing.","p058","p073",3.6667,2,2,1.3333
7801,52,323,18,"Person 1","yeah, i feel like it's almost rare to see some positive news in the media these days","p058","p073",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7802,52,323,19,"Person 2","You're right, I remember when I was younger seeing feel good stories all of the time on the news. Now it all seems to be negative.","p058","p073",2,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
7803,52,323,20,"Person 1","i mostly just tune it all out now a days. well, thanks for chatting. goodbye","p058","p073",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7804,52,323,21,"Person 2","bye","p058","p073",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
7805,52,324,0,"Person 1","Boy did that guy get dealt a bad hand in life.","p062","p054",2,2,3.3333,1.6667
7806,52,324,1,"Person 2","Yes, such an unfortunate series of events.","p062","p054",2.3333,2,3.3333,1
7807,52,324,2,"Person 1","I really feel terrible about the described events of his childhood.  To be adopted by people who then abused him.  Just disgusting, infuriating, and completely nonsensical to me.","p062","p054",3.3333,2,4.3333,2.3333
7808,52,324,3,"Person 2","And then to spend his entire life in America and be deported, what a tragedy.","p062","p054",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
7809,52,324,4,"Person 1","Yes, for sure.  Amazingly, he seems to be taking it in stride.","p062","p054",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
7810,52,324,5,"Person 2","I cant imagine being sent back to a country Ive never really lived in. It makes me feel terrible for him.","p062","p054",3,1.6667,3.3333,2
7811,52,324,6,"Person 1","Yeah, it would be surreal.  I'm glad Congress has worked to correct this issue to some degree so that negligent parents and/or adoption agencies can't deny the adopted child citizenship.","p062","p054",2.6667,0.6667,3,1.6667
7812,52,324,7,"Person 2","Yes for sure. It is good to see that this may not happen again in the future. Can you imagine how his adoptive family must have felt?","p062","p054",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.3333
7813,52,324,8,"Person 1","Well I think both his adoptive families abused him; that was most of his problem. The citizenship/deportation issue is one thing, but the thought of abusing little children, particularly an adopted one, is what really makes me sick about this.","p062","p054",3,1.6667,3,1.6667
7814,52,324,9,"Person 2","Of course. It just compounds the tragedy the child has already experienced.","p062","p054",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1
7815,52,324,10,"Person 1","And I'm sure the abuse is a large, if not the entire, reason why he got into criminal behavior, which is the real reason he's being deported.","p062","p054",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1
7816,52,324,11,"Person 2","I think in cases like this there should be some consideration given to the totality of circumstances that lead to the criminal activity.","p062","p054",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
7817,52,324,12,"Person 1","Yes, it sure feels that way.  But the system is probably limited in how much time and energy they can put into each individual case.  They likely don't have the manpower for that.","p062","p054",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
7818,52,324,13,"Person 2","That may be true but these are people's lives, how can we say that there isnt time to consider their situations?","p062","p054",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.3333
7819,52,324,14,"Person 1","I understand, but in a country of 330 million people, sometimes you have to be a number or the whole machine seizes up and ceases to work.","p062","p054",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7820,52,324,15,"Person 2","I disagree. When we fail to consider individual citizens as their own unique person rather than a populus as a whole, it creates more problems.","p062","p054",1.6667,2,2,2.3333
7821,52,324,16,"Person 1","But it's not feasible to do what you're saying.  Every court case would take months.  Do we just let everyone who commits a crime walk the streets freely for decades while we figure out how their mother treated them as a toddler?","p062","p054",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7822,52,324,17,"Person 2","There has to be a middle ground where the system works effectively but still considers the rights of individuals","p062","p054",1.6667,1,1.6667,1
7823,52,324,18,"Person 1","Sure, I don't disagree with that.  Anyway, hopefully this guy finds that Korea provides a better life for him than America.  The US sure didn't give him one.  Maybe that's terribly wishful thinking, but there isn't anything else positive about this story.","p062","p054",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1
7824,52,324,19,"Person 2","You make a good point. I would be interested to know how his life in S Korea is going now. I do hope better than what hes had so far.","p062","p054",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,2
7825,52,324,20,"Person 1","Yes, it would be a surprise happier ending if it improved.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Hope you have a good rest of your day.  goodbye","p062","p054",1.6667,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
7826,52,324,21,"Person 2","Goodbye","p062","p054",1,1,0.6667,1
7827,52,325,0,"Person 1","what a terrible situation, we let illegals get away with so much and yet an innocent man like this gets his whole life taken away!","p031","p024",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
7828,52,325,1,"Person 2","yep reminds me of the vets that served our forces getting deportes back to mexico for a DUI they did in the past. Doesn't change the fact they fought for our country more than the regular American ever  did. We need to stop deporting people that are not deserving of it and only deport the bad illegals like the ones that commit actual crimes.","p031","p024",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
7829,52,325,2,"Person 1","absolutely! We deport good people who paid hard-earned tax money to our corrupt government and let illegals stay while paying their rent, health care and schooling","p031","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
7830,52,325,3,"Person 2","our laws seem so backwards sometimes","p031","p024",2,2,2,1.3333
7831,52,325,4,"Person 1","hopefully this administration will change this country for the best","p031","p024",1.6667,0,2,1.3333
7832,52,325,5,"Person 2","this man should be in america not south korea","p031","p024",1.6667,2,2.6667,1
7833,52,325,6,"Person 1","I agree with you, my heart goes out to his innocent child and wife, the government isn't going to take care of them","p031","p024",3,2,2.6667,1.3333
7834,52,325,7,"Person 2","hopefully it works out","p031","p024",1.6667,0,1.6667,1
7835,52,325,8,"Person 1","yes, I hope he is shown clemency and justice","p031","p024",1.6667,0,3,1.3333
7836,52,325,9,"Person 2","this isnt the first of these stories i heard. One guy with a brooklying accent was deported back to his grandparents country. he died on the streets in that country because he couldnt take care of his diabetes there","p031","p024",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
7837,52,325,10,"Person 1","how terrible-and we call ourselves a democracy, in so many ways we are still a corrupt dictatorship!","p031","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
7838,52,325,11,"Person 2","yeah its quite sad how often this happens.","p031","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,1
7839,52,325,12,"Person 1","or my neighbor, who was a war vet and 72 could not get his appendix removed because his insurance would not pay for it, so in order to get his operation, he laid himself out on the street corner when it burst and finally an ambulance took him to the hospital and he got it fixed!","p031","p024",2.3333,2,3.3333,3
7840,52,325,13,"Person 2","wowww that is crazy! our health care is definitely not the best","p031","p024",3,2,3.3333,1.3333
7841,52,325,14,"Person 1","nope, especially if you got something serious going on, good luck! And these morons in the government are pushing medicaid-type of universal care, it's already bad as it is and they want to downgrade it even further. That's because they have never went to a medicaid doctor and do not know what it is!","p031","p024",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
7842,52,325,15,"Person 2","so inept these people are one wonders how they were elected","p031","p024",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
7843,52,325,16,"Person 1","by incompetent people-like the illegals they let in in order to vote them in!","p031","p024",2.6667,2,1.6667,1.3333
7844,52,325,17,"Person 2","illegals do seem to get away with a lot","p031","p024",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
7845,52,325,18,"Person 1","yes, so it's time to stop this and focus on the needs of our own people-even if we look like a \"bad guy\" by not letting them in!","p031","p024",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
7846,52,325,19,"Person 2","yep its that time we take care of all the homeless in the streets that need help first","p031","p024",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
7847,52,325,20,"Person 1","yes, look at San Francisco, and it's 2019!","p031","p024",2,2,1.3333,1

7851,89,326,1,"Person 2","yeah good thing there was still blood at the scene as evidence","p029","p024",2,0.3333,1.3333,1
7852,89,326,2,"Person 1","Yeah no doubt.  It sounds like justice will be served but it's sad things like this even happen","p029","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1
7853,89,326,3,"Person 2","yeah wonder what makes people do this","p029","p024",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
7854,89,326,4,"Person 1","Yeah seriously!!  Maybe a combination of childhood experiences, poor choices, and some sort of biochemistry.  I do not know.","p029","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2,1
7855,89,326,5,"Person 2","yeah they have nothing to lose","p029","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1

7857,89,326,7,"Person 2","do you think anything can be done to prevent these things","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1,1
7858,89,326,8,"Person 1","not really.   I'd like to say yes but I think humans habe done horrible things to other humans for all time,  what do you think","p029","p024",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
7859,89,326,9,"Person 2","i think its the consequences of being evolved from apes. we are related to them at the end of the day","p029","p024",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
7860,89,326,10,"Person 1","lol you may be right","p029","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1

7862,89,326,12,"Person 1","Yeah, an animal like drive of some sort","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
7863,89,326,13,"Person 2","yeah its crazy","p029","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
7864,89,326,14,"Person 1","yeah definitely not something I will ever understand","p029","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
7865,89,326,15,"Person 2","hope something changes soon","p029","p024",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
7866,89,326,16,"Person 1","You and me both.  do you have any ideas that might help?","p029","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1,1
7867,89,326,17,"Person 2","honestly im at a loss i would say probably stronger consequences ? just being sentenced to life doesnt seem very intimidating for already crazy people","p029","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
7868,89,326,18,"Person 1","Yeah I think you are on the right track with that.  Well I hope you have a good day, nice talking to you.  much better than the last person I had to talk  to.  goodbye!","p029","p024",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
7869,89,326,19,"Person 2","bye","p029","p024",1.3333,1,1,1
7870,89,327,0,"Person 1","Do you have much empathy for Jeffery or the victim?","p030","p068",1.3333,1,0.6667,1.3333
7871,89,327,1,"Person 2","i have empathy for anyone who dies a tragic death and for people that are so hurt they have to hurt others","p030","p068",3,1.6667,3,2.6667
7872,89,327,2,"Person 1","Are there circumstances that wouldn't warrant your empathy?","p030","p068",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
7873,89,327,3,"Person 2","im a very emotional person who likes to see these from everyones view it is hard to say","p030","p068",2.3333,1,2.6667,3
7874,89,327,4,"Person 1","I consider myself similarly, that's why I was curious. I feel like a lot of information was missing from this story. Most people don't brutally murder, immolate and bury a person because of a refused sexual advance.","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
7875,89,327,5,"Person 2","yeah i found that odd two wonder what the history was behind it","p030","p068",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7876,89,327,6,"Person 1","It seemed like a pretty high profile case. There wasn't much mentioned about the victim, but I just read that Jeffery got the maximum sentence of 28 years at the end of last year.","p030","p068",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.3333
7877,89,327,7,"Person 2","oh wow thats good but wont that mean he get out around 50 that is scary","p030","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
7878,89,327,8,"Person 1","Right, how do you pick up the pieces after spending the prime of your life in prison?","p030","p068",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
7879,89,327,9,"Person 2","exactly and how scary he will be in the general population again!","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
7880,89,327,10,"Person 1","I wonder if his surrogate father will maintain a relationship with him after all that has happened.","p030","p068",1.3333,1,2.3333,2
7881,89,327,11,"Person 2","i dont know seems like a hard call","p030","p068",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
7882,89,327,12,"Person 1","I can't imagine. He literally gave him an opportunity to live in peace and security and he threw it back at him in such a violent fashion.","p030","p068",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
7883,89,327,13,"Person 2","yeah but im sure what he went through growing up influenced that who knows what he lived through","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
7884,89,327,14,"Person 1","I'm sure there were probably traumatic events, as in any childhood, but being thrust into a life a luxury/copious amounts of alcohol and drugs (based on the article I read) can cause anyone to act erratically.","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
7885,89,327,15,"Person 2","yeah that is true there is no consequences until this big of it hapens","p030","p068",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
7886,89,327,16,"Person 1","And, when you're that far under the influence your reactions to drastic stimulus will be warped. They probably knocked him from the fourth story window on accident, realized that he was badly injured, reasoned that they would have to kill him and cover it up, etc. etc.","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2
7887,89,327,17,"Person 2","yes good point probably had no inabitions drug fueled and got afraid and panicked that poor man died so seneslesly","p030","p068",3,1.6667,3,1.6667
7888,89,327,18,"Person 1","It's a shame... Thanks for chatting! goodbye","p030","p068",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
7889,89,327,19,"Person 2","you two bye!","p030","p068",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
7906,89,328,16,"Person 1","Yes indeed. It's very difficult, I think. Science makes it harder and easier. It's a double edged sword.","p036","p010",2,2,3,2
7907,89,328,17,"Person 2","Same thing with computers.   Old days it was simple.  Now you have to do 4x the work to enter what the computers say.    I did find it interesting that both Rackover and Dilione had their heads hung very low when they were charged.   Body language says a lot.  I would love to see expressions and listen to their statements to see if you can detect a lie.","p036","p010",3,2,5,3
7908,89,328,18,"Person 1","Yes, we speak so much without words. DO you have any final ideas?","p036","p010",2,2,2,1
7909,89,328,19,"Person 2","None.   I know we have to do at least 10 turns and we can earn more.  What's your interest?","p036","p010",2,1,2,1
7910,89,328,20,"Person 1","I can do a few more rounds. What do you think the impact would be of a \"partying\" lifestyle for the jury?","p036","p010",2,1,2,1
7911,89,328,21,"Person 2","I think it sways the jurors to a guilty verdict.   Sex and partying got out of hand so IT has to be him........  I do not buy the sex piece.   They knew each other too long for that.","p036","p010",3,1,3,3
7912,89,328,22,"Person 1","You see these studies about rape cases and women \"deserving\" it. I was thinking more about the sympathy for the victim? Does it lessen that sentiment?","p036","p010",3,1,4,3
7913,89,328,23,"Person 2","No one deserves rape.   It's the only criminal offense that I can think of that always blames the victim because of previous six life, provocative clothing, etc.   It has nothing to do with the crime.   Victim is used a great deal in court - both sides play it.","p036","p010",3,2,4,3
7914,89,328,24,"Person 1","I agree with that, of course, but if there wasn't some general sentiment about it, there wouldn't be so many studies. I would hope something like that wouldn't sway anyone.","p036","p010",3,1,4,3
7915,89,328,25,"Person 2","I am a firm believer you have to pass a test to be a juror.   This article made me think a great deal about what Comunal was feeling when his surrogate son was stabbing him.","p036","p010",3,2,4,3
7916,89,328,26,"Person 1","Comunale was the friend who died, but the surrogate father was Jeffry Rackover - a jeweler for celebrities like Melania Trump.","p036","p010",2,2,2,1
7917,89,328,27,"Person 2","That's right!","p036","p010",2,1,1,1
7918,89,328,28,"Person 1","I am shocked that you meet someone at a gym and then go to lunch and then just let them take your last name. The kid was an expert grifter for sure.","p036","p010",3,2,3,3
7919,89,328,29,"Person 2","He obviously had no morals or remorse about anything.","p036","p010",3,2,3,2
7920,89,328,30,"Person 1","And back to evidence - how can that attitude about life that is so clear and evident - be used in court these days? It seems so hard to trust anyone.","p036","p010",3,2,4,3
7921,89,328,31,"Person 2","You are exactly right.  It's not easy anymore.   It's been very nice chatting with you.  I did the other Empathic Conversation a couple of days ago.  Whoever it was had not read it, so it was hard completing it.   Enjoy MTurking!   Don't forget to include the word goodbye when you receive this!  Goodbye!","p036","p010",4,2,3,2
7922,89,328,32,"Person 1","bye","p036","p010",1,1,1,1
7923,89,329,0,"Person 1","what do you think about the article?","p058","p022",0.6667,1,1,1
7924,89,329,1,"Person 2","I thought it was very disturbing and sad. You?","p058","p022",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
7925,89,329,2,"Person 1","same, im so tired of seeing articles about people being killed or other negative content, i feel like the media just wants to make everyone depressed.","p058","p022",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
7926,89,329,3,"Person 2","It's terrible. It's everywhere. Television.. social media. You just can't escape it.","p058","p022",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
7927,89,329,4,"Person 1","i dont want to get all conspiracy theorist or anything but it feels like this is being done on purpose to maybe get people to tune out or stop caring altogether","p058","p022",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
7928,89,329,5,"Person 2","It's definitely made me numb to any news i see. Even though the article we just read was terrible, it's nothing that we've never seen before","p058","p022",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,3
7929,89,329,6,"Person 1","oh definitely, its just another story, tomorrow will have another murder or something similar, its a shame how desensitized we've become","p058","p022",2,2,1.6667,1.6667
7930,89,329,7,"Person 2","Agreed. Do you think the people that burned the body should get life in prison or even the death penalty?","p058","p022",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
7931,89,329,8,"Person 1","definitely, i could see life in prison, maybe even the death penalty because of how brutal the attack was","p058","p022",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
7932,89,329,9,"Person 2","I just can't even begin to imagine what goes through these people's heads. Do they have no remorse or emotion?!","p058","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
7933,89,329,10,"Person 1","its really hard to imagine. some people just have no regard for human life. i mean they stabbed him 15 times, partially burned him and tried to bury him i mean what the hell.","p058","p022",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
7934,89,329,11,"Person 2","Seriously, that definitely sounds like a death penalty to me.","p058","p022",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7935,89,329,12,"Person 1","it'll be interesting to see what happens, seeing as how they don't know which one killed the guy, and they havent been charged with murder yet","p058","p022",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
7936,89,329,13,"Person 2","True. This also makes me wonder if things like social media adds to the increasing amount of violence in the world today","p058","p022",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
7937,89,329,14,"Person 1","i would bet it does, theres even criminals who flaunt their criminal activity on social media for bragging rights, people looking for attention, and the fame of being talked about on the news and such","p058","p022",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
7938,89,329,15,"Person 2","It's sickening. It makes me sad to think about how much the world has changed. So many mass shootings and just hate in general.","p058","p022",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
7939,89,329,16,"Person 1","some believe its a mental health problem, that maybe all these drugs doctors are pumping people up with may have side effects causing this type of behavior","p058","p022",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
7940,89,329,17,"Person 2","I didn't think of that but that can definitely be true. When you watch those commercial on television, there's like 3 minutes of just side effects","p058","p022",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
7941,89,329,18,"Person 1","yeah its scary to be honest. seems like at least once a month theres another mass shooting, or something going on. it really is a shame","p058","p022",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
7942,89,329,19,"Person 2","Let's hope things get better in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye","p058","p022",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2

7954,89,330,10,"Person 1","The way he was killed and the cover up was gruesome","p068","p022",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
7955,89,330,11,"Person 2","Yes i just don't understand. These people hvae no remorse","p068","p022",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667

7988,148,332,1,"Person 2","I agree, but we keep people in cages all day. Our society is built on the persecution out groups of all species.","p064","p030",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
7989,148,332,2,"Person 1","Yes, but most of those people did something to deserve that.","p064","p030",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
7990,148,332,3,"Person 2","That's debatable. There are people the world over her are imprisoned for being raised to believe in a particular religion, or for holding a particular ideology. I'm just attempting to point out that the world at large has little mind for the suffering of those they are not directly involved with. Do you think the elephant could be successfully reintegrated into a more natural habitat after so many years of abuse and neglect?","p064","p030",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
7991,148,332,4,"Person 1","Well I am thinking of the united states, not other countries. I have been to safaris where they rescue animals and they integrate fine and have much more room to roam than a small cave","p064","p030",2,0.6667,2.3333,3
7992,148,332,5,"Person 2","I suppose anything is better than continued indentured servitude and imprisonment, right?","p064","p030",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.3333
7993,148,332,6,"Person 1","Yea for sure","p064","p030",1.6667,0.6667,2.6667,1.3333

7996,148,332,9,"Person 2","No, I went to Disney Land years ago. Do they feature a lot of animals? Do they actually incorporate significant numbers of rescues?","p064","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
7997,148,332,10,"Person 1","This one Nosey, got sent to a elephant sanctuary in Tennessee. In DIsney & Six Flags they are in a massive area and sectioned off by what region of the world they live in, put with animals that wont kill each other, the elepants have their own area which is huge with lots of other elephants","p064","p030",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
7998,148,332,11,"Person 2","Yeah, I was thinking more about a sanctuary than a amusement park attraction. That's neat. Do you keep pets?","p064","p030",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667

8002,148,332,15,"Person 2","Well, i think that it's a complex issue when we are considering food supply. Factory farming is an ethical wasteland, and very little is going to be done to improve the circumstances for those poor creatures without significant external pressure. I firmly believe they shouldn't be imprisoned for amusement.","p064","p030",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
8003,148,332,16,"Person 1","What is Factory Farming?","p064","p030",1,1.3333,1,1.3333
8004,148,332,17,"Person 2","Industrial livestock production that focuses on maximizing output through use of hormones/pen that restrict full range of motion and minimizing bottom line production costs.","p064","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8005,148,332,18,"Person 1","Oh gotcha, yea I don't think people know much about that and those issues are rarely even talked about in the news. People just buy whatever is at the store","p064","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
8006,148,332,19,"Person 2","Yep, that's where most affordable meat in the grocery store comes from and in places like texas it is actually illegal to defame beef in any way. Thanks for chatting! bye","p064","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667

8015,148,333,7,"Person 2","I was actually in Thailand 2 years ago and got to feed and bathe elephants. It's so sad to read this.","p068","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3.6667

8031,148,334,0,"Person 1","I love elephants, that made me so sad to read.","p008","p035",3.3333,2,4,3
8032,148,334,1,"Person 2","Me too. I know they are very social.","p008","p035",2,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8033,148,334,2,"Person 1","They're sweet babies. And I think they're super smart too. I know they are at least very emotionally intelligent.","p008","p035",2.3333,0.6667,3,1.6667
8034,148,334,3,"Person 2","I think they are smart. I have seen a documentary where they visited the bones of an elephant that died a year ago","p008","p035",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8035,148,334,4,"Person 1","Yeah, they visit each other's graves, which is just heartbreaking.","p008","p035",3,1.3333,3.6667,1.3333
8036,148,334,5,"Person 2","I wonder why they just didn't take the animal instead of cite them that many times.","p008","p035",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
8037,148,334,6,"Person 1","I have no clue. It's a damn shame there isn't more protection around animals in general, legally speaking.","p008","p035",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8038,148,334,7,"Person 2","what do you think about zoos?","p008","p035",1,1,1,1
8039,148,334,8,"Person 1","They make me sad. I know there are very well maintained zoos, but for the most part they just make me sad. It's one thing if the animals are rescues, I think.","p008","p035",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
8040,148,334,9,"Person 2","Me too, I think it is animal prison","p008","p035",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
8041,148,334,10,"Person 1","Same here. And they charge money for entry on top of it.","p008","p035",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
8042,148,334,11,"Person 2","At least the animals are not forced to preform","p008","p035",2,1,2,1
8043,148,334,12,"Person 1","Or give rides to people.","p008","p035",1,1,2,1
8044,148,334,13,"Person 2","With technology zoo should be come outdated because you can learn about any animal at home.","p008","p035",1.6667,0.6667,2,1
8045,148,334,14,"Person 1","I agree. The internet is a valuable tool used for many of the wrong reasons.","p008","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
8046,148,334,15,"Person 2","I think sea world was the worst because killer whales are smart like elephants","p008","p035",1.6667,0.3333,3,2
8047,148,334,16,"Person 1","Oh my gosh, I know. Zoos make me sad, but Sea World feels like a literal crime. It's a whale. In a pool. Jeez.","p008","p035",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
8048,148,334,17,"Person 2","do you think there should be laws about keeping animals in isolation?","p008","p035",1.6667,1,1,1
8049,148,334,18,"Person 1","Probably. The only animals I can think of off the top of my head that don't travel in numbers or aren't social are reptiles.","p008","p035",1.6667,1,2,2
8050,148,334,19,"Person 2","I agree. I feel most people do not care either way.","p008","p035",2,1.6667,2,2
8051,148,334,20,"Person 1","Or they do until they lose interest. I think that was our last one. It was great talking to you! On to the next HIT. Good luck and goodbye","p008","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,1
8052,148,334,21,"Person 2","Nice talking with you too! bye","p008","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1
8053,148,335,0,"Person 1","So what did you think of this?","p029","p010",0.6667,1,0.6667,2
8054,148,335,1,"Person 2","It's sad.   USDA had all the violations - more than 200 and did nothing.   Do you go to zoos or circuses?","p029","p010",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
8055,148,335,2,"Person 1","No, I do not.  I would feel guilty going to a circus.  I might go to a zoo if it were a nice one.  We have a great one near where I live  What about you?","p029","p010",3,1,2,2.3333
8056,148,335,3,"Person 2","We do.   There is a huge one in Denver.   My granddaughters enjoy it - it is a zoo where animals have large spaces and not a little cage.  I have mixed emotions though.   Never a circus - are there any that do not mistreat animals?","p029","p010",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.6667
8057,148,335,4,"Person 1","yeah I doubt it.  I would feel guilty paying money to watch animals parade around like that.  I think they are cruel to them.","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
8058,148,335,5,"Person 2","Agreed.   They are hit and beat and put in small trailers carting them from one city to the next.   It's cruel.","p029","p010",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
8059,148,335,6,"Person 1","yeah seriously, it's totally inhumane and they have no say so in it.  I think they should shut them all down.  Zoos, if properly maintained, I think can give animals a safe and natural habitat and children can really learn from them.","p029","p010",2.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
8060,148,335,7,"Person 2","Agreed.   Nosey had so many medical conditions and no one cared.  All about the money.  (:","p029","p010",2,2,2.3333,2
8061,148,335,8,"Person 1","yeah that's terrible!  poor girl.  Elephants are intelligent and sensitive too","p029","p010",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
8062,148,335,9,"Person 2","They seem to be.   I always wanted to go to Africa to see them in their natural habitat but it's a trip I will never be able to afford.","p029","p010",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
8063,148,335,10,"Person 1","oh yeah, I have no desire to do that but I'm sure it would be really interesting and quite an experience.","p029","p010",1.6667,0,2,1.6667
8064,148,335,11,"Person 2","I just know it would be.   If I could do it in conjunction with helping the children there to learn how to read, i would be ecstatic!","p029","p010",2,0,1.6667,3
8065,148,335,12,"Person 1","that is very altruistic of you, maybe you could find financing for it?  Do the groups that sponsor it not help with the expenses?","p029","p010",2,0,2,1.6667
8066,148,335,13,"Person 2","We have a local church that goes on several mission trips.   It's large enough to help most people.   I haven't been able to find other ways to finance it.   I work with refugee families here in Denver that were relocated to us because of the violence and wars in their regions.   I love all of them so much.","p029","p010",2.3333,0,2.6667,3.3333
8067,148,335,14,"Person 1","You sound like a very caring person.  Maybe that church will one day be able to finance a project in Africa.","p029","p010",2,0,2.3333,1.3333
8068,148,335,15,"Person 2","I hope so.    Their stories are so sad but they are bright, happy children.   Several from the regions of Africa really brighten up when they share the animals they saw there and how they protected themselves.   It really isn't like we all imagine.","p029","p010",2.6667,1,3.3333,2
8069,148,335,16,"Person 1","I can imagine it is very different than what we would expect.  That's greaet that you have had that experience","p029","p010",2.3333,0,2.6667,2.3333
8070,148,335,17,"Person 2","It changes how you feel and how you live.   For that, I am eternally grateful.","p029","p010",2.3333,0,3.3333,2.6667
8071,148,335,18,"Person 1","I would think so.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, I hope you have a great day and I hope that one day you can accomplish that dream of yours.  Don't stop trying!  bye","p029","p010",2.3333,0,2,2

8073,223,336,0,"Person 1","it was a pretty sad story","p039","p031",3,2,4,2
8074,223,336,1,"Person 2","Live is so short and you never know what will happen next-that's why we always need to cherish our kids and tell them we love them!","p039","p031",3,2,3,3
8075,223,336,2,"Person 1","absolutely you never know when it can all end","p039","p031",2,2,2,1
8076,223,336,3,"Person 2","The quote: \"if you want to make God laugh tell Him about your plans\" describes it perfectly!","p039","p031",3,0,2,2
8077,223,336,4,"Person 1","yes makes sense you plan and god plans and god is the best of planners","p039","p031",2,0,2,1
8078,223,336,5,"Person 2","just makes you wonder why young and innocent kids die like that","p039","p031",2,2,2,1
8079,223,336,6,"Person 1","there is no reason to life","p039","p031",2,2,2,2

8082,223,336,9,"Person 2","He loves us-in times like this, however, you do hope that there is some form of reincarnation for those little souls to give them another chance-many people believe in that","p039","p031",3,0,2,2
8083,223,336,10,"Person 1","I hope so probably not though just the end","p039","p031",2,2,2,2
8084,223,336,11,"Person 2","even if they do not get reincarnated they will be in heaven, that's the ultimate reward, so it's not the end","p039","p031",3,0,1,2

8086,223,336,13,"Person 2","There is certainly heaven and hell and we all go back home to our God","p039","p031",2,0,1,3
8087,223,336,14,"Person 1","god is an absentee landlord","p039","p031",2,2,1,2

8090,223,336,17,"Person 2","That is not true-God gives us free will and your sorrows result from the errors that you make. He only wants to see you succeed and what is best for you, just like a father and mother would want the best for their child. Once you find your ultimate and correct path, he will bless you abundantly and things will fall into place!","p039","p031",3,0,2,4
8091,223,336,18,"Person 1","does he really give us free will though? How can we really have free will if he controls when we will die? He knows exactly the time and place of how we die so that means everything that we do in our lives is leading up to that moment which means that we do not have free will since no matter what we \"decide\" to do we will still die in the exact same moment at the exact pre ordained time","p039","p031",3,2,2,3

8116,223,337,5,"Person 2","Just a baby. Terrible. I wonder why they were hit. I imagine the driver is going to feel awful for a long time too.","p016","p047",2.6667,2,3.3333,2

8118,223,337,7,"Person 2","Yeah and likely in a small town too. Won't be able to stay there long.","p016","p047",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
8119,223,337,8,"Person 1","Agreed. I wonder how the rest of the people in the wreck are handling it — the article said it was like 10 people in the trailer, right?","p016","p047",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
8120,223,337,9,"Person 2","Yeah. I think another woman and her kid were injured. Probably will be traumatized. The driver of the trailer probably will need some therapy.","p016","p047",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
8121,223,337,10,"Person 1","I think everyone will need therapy, honestly. That line about the shoes by the side of the road with candy and blood... ouch.","p016","p047",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
8122,223,337,11,"Person 2","Disturbing. I wonder how fast the guy who hit them was going if he had just turned. Must've been pretty fast to hit the trailer hard enough to knock people off and kill some of them.","p016","p047",2.3333,2,3,2
8123,223,337,12,"Person 1","Yeah, there's no way he wasn't speeding. Not a good move, especially on Halloween when you know there's going to be kids around.","p016","p047",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
8124,223,337,13,"Person 2","Agreed. Likely drinking since it was Halloween but I don't know since the story didn't say. Could've been really dark if it was in a rural area like most of Mississippi. I'm from Alabama and it's not so great to drive there at night.","p016","p047",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
8125,223,337,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I grew up in a small town and visibility was always bad. My dad told me to always wait three seconds after a light turned green at night just in case.","p016","p047",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
8126,223,337,15,"Person 2","Yes, I was taught that too. Seen many semi trucks fly right on through.","p016","p047",1.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
8127,223,337,16,"Person 1","For sure. They always act like they own the road >.>","p016","p047",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8128,223,337,17,"Person 2","Yeah. They're bad in Texas, at least on the interstates. I just try to stay out of their way.","p016","p047",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
8129,223,337,18,"Person 1","Definitely. Not worth it, as evidenced. But anyway, it was nice talking to you, even if the topic was depressing.","p016","p047",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8130,223,337,19,"Person 2","It was nice talking to you as well. Have a great day. bye","p016","p047",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8131,223,337,20,"Person 1","bye!","p016","p047",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
8132,223,337,21,"Person 2","bye","p016","p047",1.3333,1,1,1
8133,223,338,0,"Person 1","I'd be willing to bet the driver that hit that trailer was drunk. Halloween? Yeah.","p008","p068",1,1.3333,1.6667,2
8134,223,338,1,"Person 2","oh yes he seemed so out of control","p008","p068",1,2,1.6667,1.6667
8135,223,338,2,"Person 1","Well I thought it was pretty vague about what actually happened, but like. You don't hit a trailer and be totally lucid.","p008","p068",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8136,223,338,3,"Person 2","Yeah i agree who knows maybe there was something going on medically but either way ooof","p008","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8137,223,338,4,"Person 1","Yeah, doubt that town's going to love celebrating Halloween for a hot minute. Sounds like a small town. Chunky, Missouri","p008","p068",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8138,223,338,5,"Person 2","yeah so sad im glad that they got grief counselors in there for the kids","p008","p068",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
8139,223,338,6,"Person 1","Yeah, those kids are going to have a lot of trauma to work through for a long time.","p008","p068",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
8140,223,338,7,"Person 2","ugh i feel for that family who lost the mom and kids","p008","p068",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
8141,223,338,8,"Person 1","Yes, and wild that the husband had died in a car accident earlier in the year I think it was.","p008","p068",3.3333,2,3,2.3333
8142,223,338,9,"Person 2","i know mayve this town needs to reevaluate there driving rules and test","p008","p068",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
8143,223,338,10,"Person 1","I've been in a major car accident - no one was hurt, thank god. I don't know how I would have lived with myself if someone had been killed.","p008","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
8144,223,338,11,"Person 2","yes i wonder how the man feels and if he will face jail time","p008","p068",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
8145,223,338,12,"Person 1","Well the police they quoted didn't actually give any specifics. They didn't even officially say how many people died, did they? It was very vague. Which is fine because privacy in times of mourning is essential.","p008","p068",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
8146,223,338,13,"Person 2","yeah it was vague just many injured and dead this poor town","p008","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
8147,223,338,14,"Person 1","I just was surprised it went from being as detailed as explaining the girls shoes to barely giving any actual information about what had happened.","p008","p068",2,1.6667,2,2.3333
8148,223,338,15,"Person 2","yeah i agree maybe it was for the privacy reasons like you said had to wait on families to be informed","p008","p068",1.6667,1,2,2
8149,223,338,16,"Person 1","Most likely, police are probably still investigating the cause of it, as well.","p008","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8150,223,338,17,"Person 2","that is true do not want to ruin anything for the trail or anything","p008","p068",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
8151,223,338,18,"Person 1","Yeah, it's got to be hard to be a small town cop and look at that kind of tragedy. It probably doesn't happen often.","p008","p068",2,1.6667,3,2
8152,223,338,19,"Person 2","yeah i cant imagine arriving to that seen it would scar you","p008","p068",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
8153,223,338,20,"Person 1","Well this has been very depressing. That was our last turn I think though. so goodbye !","p008","p068",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8154,223,338,21,"Person 2","bye!","p008","p068",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
8155,223,339,0,"Person 1","hey what did you think about the article","p068","p010",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
8156,223,339,1,"Person 2","It was so sad.   What started as a Halloween adventure turned to fire and tragedy.   It was hard to read.","p068","p010",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
8157,223,339,2,"Person 1","I agree especially with a family and children involved it was horrific","p068","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
8158,223,339,3,"Person 2","I know.  I didn't understand the dad pulling a trailer of kids???","p068","p010",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8159,223,339,4,"Person 1","Yeah I guess just something fun for the holiday? Probably just didnt think about risks","p068","p010",2,1.3333,2,1
8160,223,339,5,"Person 2","I guess.  A trailer full of kids (:    They would have been safer if they were just riding in the back of the truck - maybe would have been thrown out?","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1
8161,223,339,6,"Person 1","yeah but i know around here nieghborhoods are way far apart and a local dad made it fun for the kids by hauling them around like that just for fun","p068","p010",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
8162,223,339,7,"Person 2","Oh I get it.  I grew up in a rural community.  One time about 40 of us got into a cattle truck and drove to Kings Island in Cincinnati.  That was back in the day but now that I'm grown I think ooh not a great decision","p068","p010",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
8163,223,339,8,"Person 1","that sounds so fun haha I always think back to my teenage years and think why and how the things we did back then","p068","p010",2,1,2,2.3333
8164,223,339,9,"Person 2","I know.   lol   We played board games, sang, acted ridiculous and had a blast.  Once we got there, Dad had a ladder that we all climbed out.  People were astonished :)","p068","p010",2.6667,1,2.6667,3
8165,223,339,10,"Person 1","back before social media and technology took over! there was always something fun to get into socially","p068","p010",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.6667
8166,223,339,11,"Person 2","I know.   I hate all this social media.   All people do is have their heads buried in their phones oblivious to the beautiful world around us.","p068","p010",1.3333,2,2,2.3333
8167,223,339,12,"Person 1","I agree I need to go hiking or get in nature and turn my phone off a couple days a week or else i go crazy!","p068","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
8168,223,339,13,"Person 2","So agree.   I have pretty much gotten off my phone.   It's addictive and I do not like addictive behaviors.","p068","p010",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,3
8169,223,339,14,"Person 1","Me two! I feel so awful for those first responders who saw the scene that would scar me!","p068","p010",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
8170,223,339,15,"Person 2","Oh I know - I do not see how first responders deal with all the horrible things happening.  You can't unsee it once you see it.","p068","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
8171,223,339,16,"Person 1","i agree I would come away such a changed person hard not to bring that home with you","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.3333
8172,223,339,17,"Person 2","I know.   I am thankful that all these folks help in tragedies and are there for the families.","p068","p010",2.3333,0,3.3333,1.6667

8180,223,340,5,"Person 2","It makes you wonder why certain things happen","p024","p035",2,1.3333,2,2.6667
8181,223,340,6,"Person 1","agreed makes you wonder","p024","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
8182,223,340,7,"Person 2","I know funeral cost are high and having three at once would be very costly","p024","p035",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
8183,223,340,8,"Person 1","yeah and now the family is left to deal with that on top of losing them.","p024","p035",2,2,2.3333,2.3333

8196,186,341,0,"Person 1","This story was so very sad and tragic.  It was hard to read.","p010","p029",3.6667,2,3.6667,1.6667
8197,186,341,1,"Person 2","Yeah it did seem very sad to me.  I was a little confused by all the politics but it was clear a lot of people were really suffering.","p010","p029",3,2,3,2
8198,186,341,2,"Person 1","Politics?","p010","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
8199,186,341,3,"Person 2","Yes, in Kenya and South Sudan","p010","p029",1,1,1,1
8200,186,341,4,"Person 1","Mine was about children killed on Halloween night by a truck.  How does this happen?","p010","p029",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
8201,186,341,5,"Person 2","Wow, that's wild.  Mine was about a government official from South Sudan being deported from Kenya, and a bunch of murder and rapes going on in Kenya.  I have had the Halloween article before so I know what you're talking about, though.  That one was defiitely very hard to read.  Probably the saddest I've ever read on here.","p010","p029",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
8202,186,341,6,"Person 1","I know.   Husband had died away a bit ago and now two children.   Very tough.  Should we talk about that one in our chat since I have not read yours?  This is crazy.","p010","p029",3,2,3,1.6667
8203,186,341,7,"Person 2","Yes, that's what I was thinking we could do.  This is definitely bizarre, never had this happen.  Anyhow, yeah the fact that this had happened to that family twice is unthinkable.  What on earth.  So sad.","p010","p029",3.3333,2,3.6667,1
8204,186,341,8,"Person 1","I know.  I would love to know what happened to the driver of the truck.  It leaves you hanging for sure.","p010","p029",2,0.6667,3,1.6667
8205,186,341,9,"Person 2","Yeah, was there any mention of any factors that contributed to the accident?  That's one thing I could not remember.","p010","p029",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
8206,186,341,10,"Person 1","No.  They were just traveling with all those kids in a trailer and boom!  The truck rammed into the back of them.   It does say by the skid marks on the road that it was easy to draw a police diagram.","p010","p029",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1
8207,186,341,11,"Person 2","I guess it would have mentioned if alcohol or drugs were involved or anything like that.  Regardless, it doesn't make it any less sad or tragic.","p010","p029",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
8208,186,341,12,"Person 1","I am going to what happens in most wrecks.   Too distracted eating, texting, talking on the phone, or fiddling with the radio.","p010","p029",1.6667,1.3333,2,1
8209,186,341,13,"Person 2","Yeah you are probably right about that.  It is also horrific that they were out trying to have fun on a special night.  And all the kids.  Just heartbreaking.","p010","p029",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
8210,186,341,14,"Person 1","I know.  The driver of the kids was at fault as well in my opinion.  Why are there kids in a trailer that you are pulling?","p010","p029",1.6667,1.6667,2,1
8211,186,341,15,"Person 2","Yep, I must strongly agree with you on that.  I would never put my kids in a trailer or the back of a truck or anywhere but buckled safely into their seats, that seems very reckless.","p010","p029",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
8212,186,341,16,"Person 1","Very, very reckless.    Mine are always buckled even when they cry \"I don't want to\"  :)","p010","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
8213,186,341,17,"Person 2","Yep, same.  I wonder if the driver of the truck pulling the trailer was also held responsible somehow.  I'm sure they felt terrible.","p010","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1
8214,186,341,18,"Person 1","I would guess that both will have assigned responsibilities.  She would definitely be charged with child endangerment.","p010","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2,1
8215,186,341,19,"Person 2","I would think so, which is sad but she did put them in danger, sadly.  Well it has been nice speaking with you.  What an odd circumstance here.  Have a great day, goodbye","p010","p029",2,1,2.3333,1
8216,186,341,20,"Person 1","You too bye.  goodbye.","p010","p029",1.3333,1,1.3333,1

8219,186,342,2,"Person 1","I think it was a good decision","p039","p024",1.3333,0,1.3333,2
8220,186,342,3,"Person 2","why do you think it was a good decision","p039","p024",1,1,1,1.3333
8221,186,342,4,"Person 1","I think kenya should focus on kenyans like all countries should focus on their own","p039","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8222,186,342,5,"Person 2","but they have 1,000 troops in Sudan so they are not focusing on their own","p039","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8223,186,342,6,"Person 1","I know pretty dumb","p039","p024",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
8224,186,342,7,"Person 2","and they basically deported that opposition member to his death seeing as he was part of the group trying to remove the government","p039","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8225,186,342,8,"Person 1","good one less african","p039","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667

8232,186,342,15,"Person 2","Why do you dislike Africans? I've never been there","p039","p024",1,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333

8235,186,342,18,"Person 1","fair enough do you see african society, economics, and values as something to emulate?","p039","p024",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8236,186,342,19,"Person 2","Like I said. I would need to live there or visit to get a grasp on it. I'm not going to base my opinion on the news which is always full of lies and President Cheeto Mctwitter fingers speaking 24/7","p039","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
8237,186,342,20,"Person 1","Presidents are just figure heads to appease the masses and give them the illusion that the sheep have a choice on how things are really being run","p039","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
8238,186,342,21,"Person 2","Exactly. Except this one talks like he runs things when he doesn't run anything lol","p039","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8239,186,342,22,"Person 1","I'm gonna tell you a secret I voted for the guy but I vote for presidents on entertainment value so you can't be mad at me and I'm gonna vote for him again but Biden has been quite amusing lately so that might change","p039","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,3
8240,186,342,23,"Person 2","Why waste your time voting. I rather do something else at voting time. Presidents dont run anything anyway. The bankers do.","p039","p024",1.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
8241,186,342,24,"Person 1","Yea that is true we are all screwed and yet we all live in this sort of obliviousness","p039","p024",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
8242,186,342,25,"Person 2","we live in denial and think our voice is heard when it aint","p039","p024",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667

8244,186,342,27,"Person 2","its been a good talk. bye","p039","p024",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
8245,186,342,28,"Person 1","goodbye","p039","p024",1,1,1,1
8246,186,343,0,"Person 1","That's really unfortunate about the situation in Kenya, it's crazy how it feels like everywhere you turn, there's another humanitarian crisis going on.","p063","p045",3,2,2.6667,1.3333
8247,186,343,1,"Person 2","I know, I don't understand why nothing much is being done.","p063","p045",2.3333,2,2,2
8248,186,343,2,"Person 1","It sounds like there just aren't enough people willing.  The UN sends their peacekeepers, but they're still dependent on soldiers, and no countries are willing to send theirs.","p063","p045",2,2,2,1
8249,186,343,3,"Person 2","But why? It's largely the fault of the Western World to begin with, historically.","p063","p045",2,2,1.3333,1
8250,186,343,4,"Person 1","Lol everything that's wrong with the world today could probably be attributed to the Western civ in one way or another.  That's probably the point though, the Western people are selfish.","p063","p045",2.3333,2,2,1.3333
8251,186,343,5,"Person 2","Ture enough. I think about how much the Dutch are still exploiting for diamonds, for example.","p063","p045",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
8252,186,343,6,"Person 1","Yeah, it seems like for the most part all those former European powers have vacated their, \"colonies\" now, and the void of leadership has caused chaos in these countries.","p063","p045",2,2,2,1
8253,186,343,7,"Person 2","Plus the fact that they were \"held down\" for a long time, because it suited the colonial powers.","p063","p045",2,2,1.6667,1
8254,186,343,8,"Person 1","Yeah.  Hopefully with time, these nations will become stable.  It seems like there are many that are.","p063","p045",1.6667,0,1.6667,1
8255,186,343,9,"Person 2","I think that in the absence of solid help from us they need to band together, unforunately they have more than their share of opportunists as well.","p063","p045",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
8256,186,343,10,"Person 1","Right.  It's incredibly hard to band together in situations like this, there's so many different people vying for power.","p063","p045",2,2,2,1
8257,186,343,11,"Person 2","I'm not great on the history of Africa, but I know we've heard of several warlords turned presidents who have just been terrible.","p063","p045",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8258,186,343,12,"Person 1","Yeah.  That's what kind of confused me about the article.  I couldn't tell which side, if any, the UN supported.  Seemed like the rebels may have been the good guys, as it mentioned the government was raping people...","p063","p045",3.6667,2,2,2
8259,186,343,13,"Person 2","I was trying to understand that too. I've had friends who have gone over there to do charity work, fortunately nothing like that happened to any of them.","p063","p045",2.3333,0,2,2.6667
8260,186,343,14,"Person 1","Yikes.  I really respect people like that who are willing to go and help.  Takes a lot of guts and courage.","p063","p045",2.6667,0,2.3333,2.3333
8261,186,343,15,"Person 2","Most definitely, and I think it's key, rather than just throwing a few dollars at the problem. There needs to be a long-term commitment to helping these countries grow.","p063","p045",2.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
8262,186,343,16,"Person 1","Yeah it's much harder, but much more effective to give your time towards a cause, as opposed to your dollars.","p063","p045",2,0.6667,2,1.3333
8263,186,343,17,"Person 2","I think the BIll & Melinda Gates Foundation is doing a lot too, trying to come up with cheap ways to help the health and infrastructure of the poorest places.","p063","p045",2,0,1.6667,1.3333
8264,186,343,18,"Person 1","Aren't they heavy into trying to solve Malaria or something?","p063","p045",1.3333,1,1,1
8265,186,343,19,"Person 2","Very much so, it's become his personal mission to eradicate it.","p063","p045",1.6667,0,1.6667,1
8266,186,343,20,"Person 1","That's cool.  I'm not trying to sound like a bitter betty, but I wonder what portion of his fortune he's giving, in relation to a normal person's income?","p063","p045",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8267,186,343,21,"Person 2","It's actually quite large, and he's convinced a lot of other billionaires to give half their fortunes when they die. He's no longer the richest man because of how much he's given away, it's impressive.","p063","p045",2,0,2.6667,1.3333
8268,186,343,22,"Person 1","Wow.  Not related, but I read some thing about how Bezos's fortune, before the divorce, if made into one dollar bills could go to the moon and back like four times, then get stacked nine km high or something like that.","p063","p045",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
8269,186,343,23,"Person 2","Lol I can't imagine, I've been more or less poor my whole life. Bee tee dubs we can end this conversation now unless you want to go for bonus, but I think then we have to be on topic.","p063","p045",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
8270,186,343,24,"Person 1","I'm good to go, great talking to you fellow poor person! bye.","p063","p045",2,0,1.3333,1.3333
8271,186,343,25,"Person 2","You too! goodbye","p063","p045",2,0,1.3333,1
8272,186,344,0,"Person 1","how did you feel about this article?","p068","p062",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
8273,186,344,1,"Person 2","It wasn't a feel-good piece, that's for sure.","p068","p062",1.6667,2,2.6667,1.3333
8274,186,344,2,"Person 1","yesi found it a bit confusing but the human suffering aspect was horrible","p068","p062",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
8275,186,344,3,"Person 2","Yes, the idea of government forces raping and killing civilians and foreign workers is pretty terrible.  To be honest I don't really understand the Sudan situation.","p068","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
8276,186,344,4,"Person 1","Yes me niether i think they need a strong peace keeper and more vetted governemnt workers with consequences","p068","p062",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
8277,186,344,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I feel like the UN often tries to intervene in these situations and doesn't seem to accomplish a whole lot.  But I don't know.  Maybe it would be significantly worse if they weren't there.  But it doesn't seem to be ending.","p068","p062",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
8278,186,344,6,"Person 1","Yes i agree i hope they reconcile a peace treaty or something to move forward","p068","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2,2
8279,186,344,7,"Person 2","I can understand why Kenya is angry.  They're doing a lot to deal with the problem, from peacekeeping to refugees, and they get criticized in the process.","p068","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
8280,186,344,8,"Person 1","yes I agree i think there efforts are helping some but news like the brutal rape is scary","p068","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
8281,186,344,9,"Person 2","It's interesting that the rebel leaders aren't even in the country.  I'm not sure I'd keep fighting for a cause if the leaders ran away.","p068","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
8282,186,344,10,"Person 1","yeah that would sign major red flags to me those poor people I cant imagine how worse things will get for them","p068","p062",2,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
8283,186,344,11,"Person 2","It's interesting we don't hear much about Sudan.  I guess we don't like to talk about things we aren't really willing to intervene in.","p068","p062",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
8284,186,344,12,"Person 1","yeah i agree no use in worrying people if we arent going to do anything about it","p068","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
8285,186,344,13,"Person 2","I just think there's also a lot of hypocrisy though.  We wag our finger at people and talk about human rights and all that, and then do very little in a situation like this.","p068","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
8286,186,344,14,"Person 1","I agree but i think after hearing even aid workers were raped i would not want to go over and help them","p068","p062",2,2,2.6667,2.6667
8287,186,344,15,"Person 2","Right, I certainly wouldn't either.  But if I'm not willing to do anything about something, I get off my high horse about it.","p068","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
8288,186,344,16,"Person 1","that is a good way to look at it wish there was more we could do","p068","p062",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2
8289,186,344,17,"Person 2","Yeah, and I admit, these are not simple or easy problems.","p068","p062",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
8290,186,344,18,"Person 1","no they need planning and a sensitive look at them","p068","p062",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8291,186,344,19,"Person 2","And a lot of resources and manpower, too, I think.","p068","p062",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8292,186,344,20,"Person 1","well this was fun! bye","p068","p062",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333

8294,186,345,0,"Person 1","hey what did you thinkof the article?","p068","p010",1,1,0.6667,1
8295,186,345,1,"Person 2","It's sad.   The corruptness and unjustness that goes on there has been going on for hundreds of years.  (:","p068","p010",3.3333,2,3,2
8296,186,345,2,"Person 1","It is crazy I dont follow much of what happens over there so it was disturbing to read","p068","p010",3,2,3,2.3333
8297,186,345,3,"Person 2","Only reason I know some is I help refugee families here that were torn away from their homes.   I tutor the little ones who know little English.","p068","p010",3,1,2.6667,3
8298,186,345,4,"Person 1","Oh that is great you do that for them fullfilling career","p068","p010",2,0,1.6667,1.3333
8299,186,345,5,"Person 2","Exposure to tutors is about all they get in learning English because they are 1st generation.  Parents can't help.","p068","p010",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
8300,186,345,6,"Person 1","Yeah i had some class mates from haiti that were the same way it was so hard because there parents could not really speak with the teachers had to go through the children","p068","p010",2,1.6667,2,2.6667
8301,186,345,7,"Person 2","I teach several from South Sudan.   So many sad stores.   I loved Haiti - I went on a mission trip once.  It was a life changing experience.  You really don't think about \"things\" and the same way of living life anymore.","p068","p010",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,3.6667
8302,186,345,8,"Person 1","I have always wanted to go and help out I feel like I take way to much for granted sometimes people have it so much worse","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
8303,186,345,9,"Person 2","We all do until we make a decision to go and help underdeveloped, tyranical countries.","p068","p010",2,0.3333,2,1.6667
8304,186,345,10,"Person 1","Yeah after reading that the aid workers were brutally raped made me rethink that","p068","p010",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
8305,186,345,11,"Person 2","That just makes my skin crawl.    It's like some nations are full of nothing but evilness.","p068","p010",3,2,3.3333,2.6667
8306,186,345,12,"Person 1","I know they have no civilaztion or moral standards it was at the hands of the government its crazy","p068","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
8307,186,345,13,"Person 2","Absolutely!   Always a dictatorship and corrupt government.   Only honesty and humanity in leaders was Nelson Mandella.","p068","p010",2.3333,1.6667,3,1.6667
8308,186,345,14,"Person 1","He was so great I wish there were more of him in the world I remember learning about him in school","p068","p010",2.3333,0,2,2.3333
8309,186,345,15,"Person 2","Amazing man.   I saw a documentary on him once he got out of prison.   It was so moving - no dry eyes here.   Poor Haiti has never had a leader who cared about the people.   Just about palaces and stuff.","p068","p010",2.6667,0,2.6667,2.6667
8310,186,345,16,"Person 1","Always about the money and corruption needs to be more checks and balances","p068","p010",2,2,1.3333,1.3333
8311,186,345,17,"Person 2","Agreed but who does that?   They are either killed, families threatened, etc. if someone does try to do the wrong thing.   I do not know the answer.","p068","p010",2,2,2.6667,1.6667
8312,186,345,18,"Person 1","Yeah I agree it is all so sad. It was so nice chatting with you. bye","p068","p010",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

8314,113,346,0,"Person 1","I do not like the ban. What do you think?","p035","p029",1.6667,2,2.6667,2
8315,113,346,1,"Person 2","I support the ban, but I have four children and I've literally had to leave playgrounds before because people were blowing smoke everywhere.  I thought the argument about it setting a bad example was stupid, though.","p035","p029",2.6667,0.6667,2.6667,2.6667
8316,113,346,2,"Person 1","I have four children too. Yeah if it effects other people than I support the ban, but if it only hurts smokers then that is on them.","p035","p029",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.6667
8317,113,346,3,"Person 2","I mean I honestly can go either way.  It's not something I'm passionate about or would sit around arguing in favor of.  I just think it's a good idea bc people smoking at playgrounds irritates me.  I hate secondhand smoke.  But whatever, I guess at the end of the day if it bothers you so much you can leave the playground.","p035","p029",3,1.3333,3,2.3333
8318,113,346,4,"Person 1","I lumps things like this into the pile of the government telling people what to do with their bodies.","p035","p029",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
8319,113,346,5,"Person 2","yeah, I can see that too.  But children's playgrounds are made for kids.  Like, an adult has no  business smoking there.  Maybe step to the parking lot and smoke?","p035","p029",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
8320,113,346,6,"Person 1","I can agree with you on playgrounds","p035","p029",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8321,113,346,7,"Person 2","Yeah, zoos and parks not so much.  It still annoys me for people to smoke there, but that's a public space.  so there's that.","p035","p029",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
8322,113,346,8,"Person 1","I hate the smell of smoke and I think vaping is dumb but its not my body.","p035","p029",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
8323,113,346,9,"Person 2","No doubt, I'm with you on that.  Vaping I do not want done around me because apparently these things have a way of blowing up in people's faces.","p035","p029",2,2,2,1.6667
8324,113,346,10,"Person 1","vaping is also starting to kill people by messing up their lungs faster then smoking.","p035","p029",2,1.6667,2,1.3333
8325,113,346,11,"Person 2","Yeah for sure!  I think 8 deaths recorded so far?  The whole thing is blowing up.","p035","p029",2,2,2,1.3333
8326,113,346,12,"Person 1","I tend to lean on making everything legal, but that is because it personally effects me.","p035","p029",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
8327,113,346,13,"Person 2","How so?","p035","p029",1,1,1,1
8328,113,346,14,"Person 1","I have an autoimmune disease and have to take pain pills, over the past few years its been harder and harder to get because of other people abusing them that has nothing to do with me.","p035","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,3.3333
8329,113,346,15,"Person 2","Yeah, that's really unfortunate for the people who legitimately need medicines.  Even when I have had surgery, it is practically impossible to get enough medicine after the surgery so I can only imagine how you feel.  So ridiculous.","p035","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
8330,113,346,16,"Person 1","Yeah, it really sucks. That is why I would never tell another person what to do with their body.","p035","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
8331,113,346,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I hear your argument for sure.  But there is also the point of respecting children's right not to breathe secondhand smoke.  Let's just say only in areas that are made specifically for kids.","p035","p029",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
8332,113,346,18,"Person 1","I agree. If what you do effects other people then it should be banned.","p035","p029",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
8333,113,346,19,"Person 2","Yeah, no doubt.  But I totally get your point about when it only affects yourself, it's your choice. I can get behind that.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye","p035","p029",2.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
8334,113,346,20,"Person 1","You too! bye","p035","p029",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333

8337,113,347,2,"Person 1","i do two i never thought about the impact that has on children people smoking in public","p068","p024",2,0.6667,2,2
8338,113,347,3,"Person 2","yeah ive always wondered why it was allowed near children","p068","p024",2,1,1.3333,2
8339,113,347,4,"Person 1","i think banning it could have a great impact on generations to come","p068","p024",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
8340,113,347,5,"Person 2","yeah nothing worse than breathing that in","p068","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
8341,113,347,6,"Person 1","true probably better for everyone actually","p068","p024",1.6667,0,2.3333,1.3333
8342,113,347,7,"Person 2","yeah its the only solution in my opinion","p068","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2
8343,113,347,8,"Person 1","true cant believe that people are against it","p068","p024",1.6667,2,2,2
8344,113,347,9,"Person 2","probably just hardcore smokers that depend on smoking to live","p068","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.3333
8345,113,347,10,"Person 1","yeah really addicted probably thats sad so selfish","p068","p024",2.3333,2,3,1.6667
8346,113,347,11,"Person 2","yeah that is too selfish","p068","p024",2,2,3,1.3333
8347,113,347,12,"Person 1","maybe when it changes theyll get used to it and wont care so much","p068","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8348,113,347,13,"Person 2","yeah theyll have their spots to smoke in","p068","p024",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
8349,113,347,14,"Person 1","true i saw it was a choice or something","p068","p024",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
8350,113,347,15,"Person 2","hopefully this stops people from wanting to start smoking","p068","p024",1.3333,0,2.3333,1.3333
8351,113,347,16,"Person 1","yeah would be great for future generations will be so much healthier","p068","p024",1.6667,0,2.3333,1.6667
8352,113,347,17,"Person 2","yeah that would be amazing to see","p068","p024",2,0,2,2
8353,113,347,18,"Person 1","i am glad as we get older we do more for our future kids and generations","p068","p024",2,0,2.3333,2.3333
8354,113,347,19,"Person 2","yeah ive noticed that too","p068","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.3333
8355,113,347,20,"Person 1","well this was fun have a great day!","p068","p024",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.3333
8356,113,347,21,"Person 2","you too!. bye","p068","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8357,113,347,22,"Person 1","bye!","p068","p024",1,0.6667,1,1
8358,113,348,0,"Person 1","What'd you think of the article?","p030","p062",1.3333,1,0.6667,2
8359,113,348,1,"Person 2","I had mixed emotions, I guess.  How about you?","p030","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
8360,113,348,2,"Person 1","My emotions could also be considered \"mixed.\"","p030","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
8361,113,348,3,"Person 2","I guess I'm not all that averse to the notion of limiting children's exposure to second-hand smoke through regulations.  But the explanation for why these people wanted to do it seemed bizarre.  To prevent children from seeing people smoke... I don't agree with that.","p030","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
8362,113,348,4,"Person 1","As a smoker myself, I felt the need to parley with the author of the article.","p030","p062",2,2,2.6667,2.6667
8363,113,348,5,"Person 2","How do you feel about the dwindling space and opportunity you have to smoke?  Do you think you should be allowed to smoke anywhere?  I think it's certainly a mixed message we send about smoking.  It's legal.... only we don't want you to do it anywhere.","p030","p062",2,1,2,1.6667
8364,113,348,6,"Person 1","Frankly, I enjoy the fact that the space is dwindling. Smoking is more than a nicotine fix for me. It also gives me an excuse and an opportunity to get away from other people for a while. The only time it really bothers me is when I've got a flight with connections.","p030","p062",2.3333,1,2.3333,3
8365,113,348,7,"Person 2","And how about from a more political perspective?  Do you think towns, for example, should have the right to basically tell you you can't smoke anywhere in public?","p030","p062",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
8366,113,348,8,"Person 1","The government dictates a lot of what people can and can't do in public. I'm assuming you don't smoke. Are you bothered by seeing/smelling people smoke in public?","p030","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
8367,113,348,9,"Person 2","It depends.  That's kind of the point I'm getting to.  You can find precedent to justify banning smoking in public.  You can find precedent to not.  I was just curious what your take is as a smoker.  i'm not a smoker, but in most situations I'm not averse to the idea of people being allowed to smoke.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
8368,113,348,10,"Person 1","It may not be an apt analogy, but I equate smoking in public to open carry. I'm not comfortable with seeing a person holding a gun on their hip, it makes me nervous for my health and the health of those around me. But, people are allowed to do it and I just keep my distance.","p030","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,3
8369,113,348,11,"Person 2","Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm sure that part of my attitude towards smoking is from experience.  I grew up with people smoking in public and around me, so it was never strange.  But people who grew up more recently view it very differently.  Think about how crazy it is to think that, not so insanely long ago, people could smoke on a plane.  It seems like another planet.","p030","p062",2.6667,1,2.3333,3
8370,113,348,12,"Person 1","Planes, schools, hospitals... I'm trying to think of another behavior that has been similarly restricted but i'm coming up short.","p030","p062",2,1,1.6667,1.3333
8371,113,348,13,"Person 2","Yeah, in my lifetime I can't think of any.  When was public drinking outlawed?  That was probably legal at one time.  Times do change.  Drinking and driving wasn't always illegal.  And one of my family's first cars didn't have seatbelts.  And that was legal.","p030","p062",2,1,1.6667,2
8372,113,348,14,"Person 1","My grandfather had a '57 Chevy that didn't have seatbelts. You can still have open containers in Missouri. Our childhood hasn't disappeared yet.","p030","p062",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
8373,113,348,15,"Person 2","I wouldn't mind seeing some restrictions on cell phone use.  Civility would spike dramatically if people had to look at real people more often, I think.","p030","p062",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
8374,113,348,16,"Person 1","That's actually an idea everyone could profit from. Imagine having to look service workers in the face and appreciate their contribution to society at large.","p030","p062",1.6667,0,2.3333,1.3333
8375,113,348,17,"Person 2","Yeah, it's interesting how as a society we're up in arms about one addiction (smoking) while disregarding another one.","p030","p062",2,1,2,1.6667
8376,113,348,18,"Person 1","Eh, more people profit from cell phone use than smoking. It's been a joy chatting with you. Have a good one! bye","p030","p062",2,0,1.6667,1.3333
8377,113,348,19,"Person 2","Yeah, nice chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye","p030","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8378,113,349,0,"Person 1","hey what did you think of that article","p068","p036",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
8379,113,349,1,"Person 2","I thought it was a pretty well written, but I wonder who is supposed to receive our empathy... the children or the smokers?","p068","p036",2.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
8380,113,349,2,"Person 1","I think it is suppose to make you choose, I can see both sides but I really have to side with the children","p068","p036",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
8381,113,349,3,"Person 2","I agree with that. It is good to protect the kids.","p068","p036",2.3333,0.3333,2,2
8382,113,349,4,"Person 1","Yeah there bodys are so fragile as is","p068","p036",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
8383,113,349,5,"Person 2","As they are developing it is important to make sure they can develop safely.","p068","p036",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
8384,113,349,6,"Person 1","I agree I think this kind of law should be everywhere","p068","p036",1.6667,0.3333,2,2
8385,113,349,7,"Person 2","What do you think of the law about preventing parents smoking in the car they own?","p068","p036",1,1,1,1.3333
8386,113,349,8,"Person 1","I love that, personally my father went outside to smoke and never smoked with us in the car but my friends parents did and I would feel so sick after being in there car no child should suffer through it","p068","p036",2.3333,0.6667,3,4
8387,113,349,9,"Person 2","I agree with this too. Do you think it should extend to homes?","p068","p036",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8388,113,349,10,"Person 1","I wish but I know that would be so hard to do maybe more education for parents about how much it effects kids","p068","p036",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
8389,113,349,11,"Person 2","Well, maybe. But really just educating the politicians should be enough, right? They could then pass the law","p068","p036",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
8390,113,349,12,"Person 1","yeah but the amount of backlash people would have about it being there own home i think educating parents would be a great step maybe at prediatricians offices","p068","p036",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
8391,113,349,13,"Person 2","WHy do you think, though, that there hasn't been the backlash for that really...","p068","p036",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8392,113,349,14,"Person 1","I dont think i understand the question backlash for the house law>","p068","p036",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8393,113,349,15,"Person 2","I mean, backlash for the car law.","p068","p036",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8394,113,349,16,"Person 1","oh okay, i see your point maybe because its still kind of public others can see im not to sure","p068","p036",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
8395,113,349,17,"Person 2","Back to the kids, what about their current suffering - do you think the smoke is dramatically affecting them, or marginally?","p068","p036",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.3333
8396,113,349,18,"Person 1","there little bodys and influences probably drastically! well I have to go great talking to you! bye","p068","p036",2.3333,1.3333,3,1.6667

8398,113,350,0,"Person 1","What do you think about the article?","p035","p068",0.6667,1,0.3333,1
8399,113,350,1,"Person 2","It really effected me as my father smoked whilei was growing up","p035","p068",3,1.6667,2.6667,3.3333

8403,113,350,5,"Person 2","Yeah I can see that but also smoking in public makes others around you not have the choice to breathe in second hand smoke","p035","p068",2,1.6667,2,2
8404,113,350,6,"Person 1","Yeah I agree with that.","p035","p068",1.3333,0.3333,2,1.6667

8441,116,352,2,"Person 1","I agree. There are so many things this article brings up in me. I think the first is the access to vaccines, their use, and extrapolated to my situation as an American - the current anti-vaccine movement. This doctors had to go through hoops to get a vaccine for a dying population, and we take it so much for granted here that we have a significant group of people undermining the entire concept of vaccinations.","p036","p024",2,1,3,2.3333
8442,116,352,3,"Person 2","Agreed that we take it for granted here, to have some people hate vaccines like they do","p036","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8443,116,352,4,"Person 1","I think of my son, who is 8, and the possibility that he will be exposed to something, and it makes me frustrated. Our neighbors and anti-vaccine and they have a peer for my son. I don't think they understand that a vaccine works when the community uses it. When there are people who exempt themselves, it creates problems with the strategy to eradicate a disease. Then I think of these poor kids who are just trying to get through each day. Not only dealing with dirty water, but also no vaccine...","p036","p024",2.6667,2,3.3333,4
8444,116,352,5,"Person 2","have you heard about the re-emerging diseases because people arent taking vaccines","p036","p024",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8445,116,352,6,"Person 1","Absolutely. OK, that neighbor used to work in my office. She quit, then sued us for harrasment because we didn't let her work from home full time after having a baby. THEN she moved in next door and the first thing that happened was that her son got whooping cough - which is in the vaccines. The poor kid looked like death and was still going to school like it was nothing. That was the day I started driving my son to school every day - just in case.","p036","p024",3,1.6667,2.3333,4
8446,116,352,7,"Person 2","jesus you would think once her kid got that whooping cough she'd realize maybe the vaccines aren't so bad after all. People like that ruin it for the rest of us.","p036","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
8447,116,352,8,"Person 1","I agree. I think I got over empathic and took over the conversation with my personal story haha. What else did you feel in the article?","p036","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
8448,116,352,9,"Person 2","its fine I like to hear stories like that lol. Also, I feel like when the Haitian government said no to distributing vaccines, that was just terrible to read.","p036","p024",3,1.6667,2,2
8449,116,352,10,"Person 1","Interesting because that was my other point I wanted to make. I am a generally liberal person. Certainly on a social level, but I also think a regulated and conscientious welfare system benefits the greater society... but I will be damned if reading a story like this doesn't make me at least understand the feelings of those people who want small government.","p036","p024",2.6667,2,2.6667,3
8450,116,352,11,"Person 2","I think the people that want small government go to the extremes though. They want basically no government and that would be hard to live without.","p036","p024",2,2,1.6667,2
8451,116,352,12,"Person 1","Absolutely. I fundamentally believe a truly democratic government would struggle supporting leaders that make these types of decisions in this article.... but then again, we got a Trump, so I don't know...","p036","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
8452,116,352,13,"Person 2","Oh man I still don't know how Trump got elected...","p036","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1,2
8453,116,352,14,"Person 1","I felt blindsided that night. I didn't cry, but I was absolutely shocked. And I am really over the \"I told you sos.\" Just for reference, the anti-vax neighbor is also a big Trump supporter hahaha... Anyway. back to the article - I don't understand how an organization like WHO doesn't have more ability to assist in this situation.","p036","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2,3.3333
8454,116,352,15,"Person 2","Why am I not surprised that someone anti-vax is a Trump supporter haha. And yeah, it seems to me that a lot of these organizations don't have the power they should have in these situations.","p036","p024",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
8455,116,352,16,"Person 1","I saw that and then you see how the UN actually brought the epidemic. It's all such a mess. (This is turn 9 of 10 btw).","p036","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
8456,116,352,17,"Person 2","Yeah hopefully they can get this mess sorted out. And yeah should we end it now? It's been a good talk by the way enjoyed it!","p036","p024",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8457,116,352,18,"Person 1","One more round (be sure to stay and answer the extra question). I do hope the best. As a parent I really do have a lot of feelings for what these communities are going through.","p036","p024",1.6667,1,2,3
8458,116,352,19,"Person 2","Couldn't imagine being a parent and not having proper healthcare access  for them","p036","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
8459,116,352,20,"Person 1","It's awful. We were on the marketplace for years and that was awful - $7k deductible! ANyway. It has been nice. Have a good day. bye","p036","p024",3,2,2,3.3333
8460,116,352,21,"Person 2","have a great day. bye","p036","p024",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8461,116,353,0,"Person 1","hey what were your thoughts on the article?","p068","p010",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
8462,116,353,1,"Person 2","It made me very frustrated on how governments can withhold medical treatment from people.  It's their choice (or should be) whether to accept it or not.","p068","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
8463,116,353,2,"Person 1","exactly and i think dying is way worse then side effects they might have been concerned about","p068","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
8464,116,353,3,"Person 2","Exactly.  It gave them a 50-65% to live.","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
8465,116,353,4,"Person 1","yes, i wish there was more they could do to prepare for epidemics","p068","p010",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
8466,116,353,5,"Person 2","I learned that President Polk died from it.   Folks studied New York outbreaks and found it was from one place.","p068","p010",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
8467,116,353,6,"Person 1","oh wow that is interesting i cant believe 2019 and people are dying from more curable disease","p068","p010",2,1.6667,2,2
8468,116,353,7,"Person 2","The article stated late 1800s but I can't remember the year from the article.  I didn't know it was ever in the US","p068","p010",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8469,116,353,8,"Person 1","oh wow, maybe because our clean water systems it is not a thing anymore","p068","p010",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8470,116,353,9,"Person 2","Exactly.   Folks in 3rd world countries have no clean water anywhere and aren't educated enough to know what to do.   I thought the Bill and Melinda Gates reference was a great testament in how they give back because of their success.","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
8471,116,353,10,"Person 1","yes, the gates family are great philanthropist i admire i wish there were more. I like how the foundation is empowering women to sell the chlorine tablets to prevent the epidemic","p068","p010",1.3333,1,2,2.3333
8472,116,353,11,"Person 2","Agreed.  What I didn't come away with is why the WHO is so difficult to get things passed when it comes to deadly diseases.  It's very antiquated.","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
8473,116,353,12,"Person 1","yes, there should be a system put in place for these poor countries that suffer natural disasters to prevent these epidemics","p068","p010",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
8474,116,353,13,"Person 2","Absolutely should.   What else surprised you in the article?","p068","p010",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
8475,116,353,14,"Person 1","i like the idea that you shouldnt rely on vaccines but also implement preventatives because it is so hard to fight epidemics once they start","p068","p010",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
8476,116,353,15,"Person 2","I just wonder if it has been effective.   The world is past another pandemic of some sort.  It's coming but I do not think CDC or WHO are ready if it happens.","p068","p010",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
8477,116,353,16,"Person 1","I dont believe so either, and im sure once it happens there will be a medicine shortage and fear mongering on the news","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
8478,116,353,17,"Person 2","And society has reached a point where lives would be lost in getting the vaccine or medication.  It would be mass chaos around the world because there are so many more people.","p068","p010",1.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8479,116,353,18,"Person 1","oh i agree and then with travel and that thing i cant imagine","p068","p010",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667

8482,116,353,21,"Person 2","Of course, Port Au Prince always needs help.  It really makes you tearful.   I went on a mission where there were many illnesses in the mountains.   No stores, little clean water, and bartering for what you needed.   There were so many sick people they lined up at 4:30 in the morning when the sun came up and stayed until sunset.   There was no electricity.","p068","p010",2.6667,1.6667,3,3.3333
8483,116,353,22,"Person 1","Wow, I wonder if there was more light brought to places like there if there would be more effort to help them. I believe we should help develop third world sick countries to build themselves up","p068","p010",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
8484,116,353,23,"Person 2","I believe so.  When there are no bathroom facilities and tarantulas everywhere, most folks say no.   The people there were so gracious.  They have to garden their own food and have a few chickens so food is very scarce; yet, they wanted to prepare a dinner for us.","p068","p010",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,3.6667

8486,116,353,25,"Person 2","They are missing out on a beautiful, giving experience.   I really do not have any other comments on the article I read but we have to keep going.

8550,44,356,19,"Person 2","or maybe some kind of love thing gone bad?","p024","p068",1,1.3333,1,1.3333
8551,44,356,20,"Person 1","it could be that too","p024","p068",1,1,1,1.3333

8555,44,357,0,"Person 1","Have you ever imagined killing another person?","p030","p035",1,1.6667,1,1.3333
8556,44,357,1,"Person 2","No, how about you?","p030","p035",1,1.3333,1,1.6667
8557,44,357,2,"Person 1","I've pictured myself in situations where that might be an eventuality. You've never hypothetically lived as a soldier? You've never imagined having to take a family member off life support?","p030","p035",2,2,1,3
8558,44,357,3,"Person 2","No, I never hypothetically lived as a soldier. I have taken a family member off of life support but I do not think of that as killing someone.","p030","p035",2,1,1,3.3333
8559,44,357,4,"Person 1","We frame things in a certain way to make them easier to live with. Do you think that living in a world ridden with bad news has compromised our ability to sympathize with victims of murder?","p030","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1,2
8560,44,357,5,"Person 2","I totally agree with that. I think we put way less value on life than we should.","p030","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8561,44,357,6,"Person 1","While reading the article I tried to think of what kind of impetus it would take for me to end another human beings life. I couldn't find one. Is there some kind of stimulus that would drive you to take such drastic action?","p030","p035",2,1.6667,1.3333,3
8562,44,357,7,"Person 2","Protect my family is the only thing I can think of.","p030","p035",2,0.3333,2,2.6667
8563,44,357,8,"Person 1","That's totally reasonable. Did it strike you as odd that this happened in an airport?","p030","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8564,44,357,9,"Person 2","Yes, I was thinking they were lovers or something. The story really did not give a reason for the shooting.","p030","p035",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
8565,44,357,10,"Person 1","Yeah, these articles are everything but thorough.","p030","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.6667
8566,44,357,11,"Person 2","How would you feel if your plane was delayed? would you have empathy for the person who died?","p030","p035",1,1,1,1.3333
8567,44,357,12,"Person 1","Having dealt with delays for much less morbid reasons, yes I believe I would. How about you?","p030","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.6667
8568,44,357,13,"Person 2","I would, but it made me think about how many lives that one shooting effected.","p030","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
8569,44,357,14,"Person 1","That's the ticket isn't it? How many people cared about the victim? How will it affect their lives having to deal with the grief of losing a loved one. That's the kind of news that doesn't get reported on.","p030","p035",1.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
8570,44,357,15,"Person 2","Yeah, the story is reported is most people get to move on. Like this mass shooting are a talking point for some, but to others its their new reality of living without a loved one.","p030","p035",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
8571,44,357,16,"Person 1","Right. It's the body count that people tune in for. The reality of living with it is a one off and much more difficult to report on.","p030","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
8572,44,357,17,"Person 2","As I get older some stories stick with me more. Like that little girl who was shot in texas. I have a daughter the same age and same name.","p030","p035",2,1.6667,1.6667,3.3333
8573,44,357,18,"Person 1","Wow. I can understand why something like that would stick. Wish you the best. Thanks for chatting! bye","p030","p035",2.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667

8587,44,358,12,"Person 1","yes you think someone would have stopped him","p040","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333

8598,44,359,0,"Person 1","what did you think?","p039","p029",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
8599,44,359,1,"Person 2","Ugh I just think it's so sad every time I hear of some senseless shooting like this.  It's always some lunatic with a gun who's angry at the world or emotionally unstable and takes it out on others.  So insane.  What did you think?","p039","p029",2.6667,2,3,2.3333
8600,44,359,2,"Person 1","the world is getting worse","p039","p029",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
8601,44,359,3,"Person 2","definitely more unstable","p039","p029",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
8602,44,359,4,"Person 1","maybe its the culuture","p039","p029",0.6667,1.6667,1,1.3333
8603,44,359,5,"Person 2","what about it do you think?","p039","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
8604,44,359,6,"Person 1","its a uniquely american problem","p039","p029",1,1.6667,1,2
8605,44,359,7,"Person 2","I don't think so, this is happening in many other countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, too.  Sometimes it is knives or machetes instead of guns but the same premise of some lunatic just massacreing other people for no apparent reason","p039","p029",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8606,44,359,8,"Person 1","yea but in the first world mass shootings happen way more here then anywhere else I guess since we have to be the best in everything mass shootings should be no different","p039","p029",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
8607,44,359,9,"Person 2","I'm not sure, I haven't seen any data supporting that but perhaps you have some.  Regardless, it is happening too much anywhere.","p039","p029",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
8608,44,359,10,"Person 1","just google it and see if its true and its not the guns other countries have guns too","p039","p029",1,1.3333,1,1.6667
8609,44,359,11,"Person 2","http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/  This says the US is actually number 66 on the list of mass shootings per capita","p039","p029",0.6667,1.6667,1,1.3333
8610,44,359,12,"Person 1","The truth of the matter is that the United States is actually number sixty-six on the list of countries in terms of mass shooting rates per capita, but they have had more mass shootings than any other country in terms of overall numbers.","p039","p029",1.3333,1.3333,1,2
8611,44,359,13,"Person 2","Per capita would be the relevant statistic.  But regardless, it is clear that it is a problem in many countries, not just the U.S.  It is a global issue.","p039","p029",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8612,44,359,14,"Person 1","yes it is a global problem but we're number one in overall numbers thank god we need to be number one in everything because we are exceptional","p039","p029",2,1.6667,1,2.3333
8613,44,359,15,"Person 2","What did you think of the man in the article?","p039","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
8614,44,359,16,"Person 1","typical american guy","p039","p029",1,1.6667,1,1.6667
8615,44,359,17,"Person 2","how so?","p039","p029",0.6667,1,1,1.3333
8616,44,359,18,"Person 1","football","p039","p029",0.6667,1,1,1
8617,44,359,19,"Person 2","Well you have a great day, I gotta go.  bye!","p039","p029",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333
8618,44,359,20,"Person 1","bye","p039","p029",1,1,1,1
8619,44,360,0,"Person 1","I have a lot more questions than answers after reading that, like how did they even know for sure they had the right suspect","p067","p031",1.3333,1,0.6667,2
8620,44,360,1,"Person 2","I was also wondering why this man was targeted? Was he involved in something shady or was he picked randomly by the shooter?","p067","p031",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8621,44,360,2,"Person 1","not a lot of info, maybe they were trying to avoid public panic, or just didn't know much","p067","p031",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
8622,44,360,3,"Person 2","they never tell public the truth anyway, just like the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, everyone knows that's not what happened, fake news","p067","p031",1.6667,2,1,2
8623,44,360,4,"Person 1","you would think airports would be more locked down","p067","p031",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
8624,44,360,5,"Person 2","yes, very true, however, anyone who is serious about doing something can smuggle one weapon or another and there is no way to stop it-those people are clever and won;t be discovered easily!","p067","p031",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
8625,44,360,6,"Person 1","I suppose, it did say he was in a parking garage, you don't have to go through security even for that","p067","p031",1,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8626,44,360,7,"Person 2","no, anyone can drive up there, he probably had his guns in the car","p067","p031",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8627,44,360,8,"Person 1","if it was a terrorist, I think they could probably do more damage without even getting on a plane","p067","p031",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
8628,44,360,9,"Person 2","that's why it sounds fishy to me-only one man was targeted, why?","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8629,44,360,10,"Person 1","probably normal reasons for murder, personal grievances etc","p067","p031",1,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8630,44,360,11,"Person 2","that's exactly what I'm thinking, but they made it sound like the victim was an exemplary husband, father, etc., who was suddenly taken out","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
8631,44,360,12,"Person 1","yeah it doesn't add up, I really wonder why they believed the man in question was the real suspect, or if that was just the convenient assumption","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
8632,44,360,13,"Person 2","to close the case and spread fake news to the public, regular sources of news cannot be trusted, period, it's like hearing made up fairy tales there's maybe 20% of truth all in all!","p067","p031",1.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
8633,44,360,14,"Person 1","frustrating that there are not really reliable sources of info","p067","p031",2.3333,2,1.6667,2
8634,44,360,15,"Person 2","yes, you have really dig on the internet to get to the bottom, we will be shocked 20-25 years from now of what really went on!","p067","p031",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8635,44,360,16,"Person 1","if even, not like they've released much on JFK etc","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,1,2
8636,44,360,17,"Person 2","very true, some day they will have to re-write the entire history","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
8637,44,360,18,"Person 1","maybe by then they will have figured out how to get airport security right","p067","p031",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8638,44,360,19,"Person 2","exactly, instead of X-raying and groping harmless people who want to bring baby food on the plane!","p067","p031",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8639,44,360,20,"Person 1","yeah it's all security theater, not sure if actual security would even be possible tbh","p067","p031",1.3333,2,1.3333,2
8640,44,360,21,"Person 2","Israel has the most secure airports in the world, they got their system down pretty good, US should do the same","p067","p031",1,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8641,44,360,22,"Person 1","what does Israel do","p067","p031",0.6667,1,1,1
8642,44,360,23,"Person 2","I'm not sure, but I know they got everything combed carefully-including their parking, not one person gets passed without a scan or a check","p067","p031",1,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8643,44,360,24,"Person 1","I think I read something about how they do a lot of face and body language reading, but also probably racial profiling","p067","p031",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8644,44,360,25,"Person 2","that's a good idea, but wait-people will cry like babies and us racists if we start racial profiling, they find everything offensive","p067","p031",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
8645,44,360,26,"Person 1","hmm","p067","p031",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
8646,44,360,27,"Person 2","society needs to focus more on people and less racism etc. we have greater issues to tackle!","p067","p031",1.6667,0,1.3333,2
8647,44,360,28,"Person 1","I am not sure, in this particular case at least I don't know if it would have made a difference","p067","p031",1,1.3333,1,1.6667
8648,44,360,29,"Person 2","yes, whatever the reason my heart goes out to the family left behind, he had two kids","p067","p031",2,0.6667,3,2.3333
8649,44,360,30,"Person 1","yeah a very tragic situation","p067","p031",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2
8650,44,360,31,"Person 2","as for the murderer, he was a coward, did his crime and took himself out, very pathetic","p067","p031",3,2,2,2.3333
8651,44,360,32,"Person 1","yes, not sure how people can think that's a good idea. Well that's all I have to say, bye","p067","p031",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
8652,44,360,33,"Person 2","goodbye and thanks for chatting !","p067","p031",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333

8655,163,361,2,"Person 1","I'm not sure why Indian security forces are firing on civilians, it wasn't stated.","p045","p022",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8656,163,361,3,"Person 2","I think there was just tension and war in the area and the girl was caught in a bad situation","p045","p022",1.3333,2,2,1.6667
8657,163,361,4,"Person 1","I know that Kashmir has been a big problem area for a long time, it flares up now and again.","p045","p022",1,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8658,163,361,5,"Person 2","It's just sad that a civilian that has done no harm gets caught in something like this.","p045","p022",1.6667,2,2.6667,2
8659,163,361,6,"Person 1","The other thing is the weapons they're using - kind of like shotguns, it's so random.","p045","p022",1,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8660,163,361,7,"Person 2","That's a great point. War sucks cuz civilian casualties are almost a guarantee","p045","p022",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
8661,163,361,8,"Person 1","You would think that India would take a more benevolent attitude towards a disputed region.","p045","p022",1,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8662,163,361,9,"Person 2","Agreed. I think i recently saw some news that US is sending in drones that killed a couple hundreds of civilians as well","p045","p022",1,2,1.6667,2.3333
8663,163,361,10,"Person 1","I didn't hear about that, sounds a bit sketchy. I wonder if there's any charity or something that can help that girl?","p045","p022",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
8664,163,361,11,"Person 2","I'm sure there are some out there. I can't even imagine having sight and next thing you know, you're blind. It's horrible","p045","p022",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
8665,163,361,12,"Person 1","I think that if there were more publicity/press coverage here of these kind of things, they might happen less.","p045","p022",1,0.3333,1.3333,2
8666,163,361,13,"Person 2","yeah, i never hear anything about this. All you see are celeb gossip and things of that nature","p045","p022",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333

8676,163,362,2,"Person 1","yeah those security personnel need to be dealt with for that","p024","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
8677,163,362,3,"Person 2","Especially since the article said they've started using specially designed pellets to make the damage worse!","p024","p016",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8678,163,362,4,"Person 1","woww that is so crazy","p024","p016",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
8679,163,362,5,"Person 2","Hard to say it's \"just crowd control\" or whatever when it says they're designed to cause maximum dispersal w damage.","p024","p016",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8680,163,362,6,"Person 1","Agreed. Also they're designed for hunting animals I believe as well.","p024","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8681,163,362,7,"Person 2","Yeah. And humans are not animals. :/","p024","p016",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
8682,163,362,8,"Person 1","unfortunately those people probably dont think that","p024","p016",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
8683,163,362,9,"Person 2","More likely they care more about political power and land. Splitting Pakistan and India has been problematic since it first happened :/","p024","p016",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
8684,163,362,10,"Person 1","Didn't know much about that. Were  they once together?","p024","p016",1,1,1,1.6667
8685,163,362,11,"Person 2","Yes, Pakistan was once part of India and it was split apart in 1947. The concept was to split apart the regions based on religious beliefs but families got split across the border and it has never quite gotten over it.","p024","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
8686,163,362,12,"Person 1","Ahh. Didn't know about that. Yes splitting countries is never good, sort of like  Korea.","p024","p016",1,1.3333,1,1.6667
8687,163,362,13,"Person 2","Or the attempt in Vietnam, yes.","p024","p016",1,1.3333,1,1.3333
8688,163,362,14,"Person 1","yeah that usually results in disaster","p024","p016",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
8689,163,362,15,"Person 2","Anyway, going back to the article, I thought it was really sad that the girl seemed to have been blinded for no reason — it sounded like she just got caught in the crossfire or something.","p024","p016",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
8690,163,362,16,"Person 1","She did want to become a doctor so I doubt she would be out causing trouble for no reason.","p024","p016",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8691,163,362,17,"Person 2","I wonder if there's any hope of her fulfilling that dream now that she's blind :(","p024","p016",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8692,163,362,18,"Person 1","thats quite depressing","p024","p016",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
8693,163,362,19,"Person 2","Senseless violence usually is :(","p024","p016",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
8694,163,362,20,"Person 1","it seems us humans have been violent as far back as the history books say","p024","p016",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
8695,163,362,21,"Person 2","We are indeed a species with a large capacity both for senseless violence and reckless kindness.","p024","p016",2,2,1.3333,2.3333
8696,163,362,22,"Person 1","Agreed on that. It's been a good talk bro. bye","p024","p016",1.3333,0.6667,1,1.3333

8703,163,363,5,"Person 2","It sure is.  Not sure I could do that.  When the journalists met with her, she showed him all the textbooks.  She wanted to become a doctor.","p024","p010",3,1.3333,2,2.3333
8704,163,363,6,"Person 1","Yeah shes a good girl who had a good future","p024","p010",3,1,2,1.6667

8772,80,366,2,"Person 1","It's never a good sign when reporters are fired/attacked/maligned for doing their jobs, yeah.","p016","p024",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
8773,80,366,3,"Person 2","Yeah. All for trying to give a voice to the raped women.","p016","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
8774,80,366,4,"Person 1","Agreed. It was startling how many people the article said were stateless, too—nearly a million, I think it said?","p016","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
8775,80,366,5,"Person 2","Yep it said there are about 1 million Rohingya Muslims in Burma who are stateless","p016","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
8776,80,366,6,"Person 1","I can't imagine how difficult that would be to manage, plus with the health services being suspended. That's a recipe for disaster :/","p016","p024",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
8777,80,366,7,"Person 2","imagine the diseases going around the area its frightening","p016","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
8778,80,366,8,"Person 1","Especially in the camps the article mentioned; the article said there aren't any doctors at most of clinics.","p016","p024",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
8779,80,366,9,"Person 2","You would think the UN or someone would reach in and help them out","p016","p024",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8780,80,366,10,"Person 1","I think it mentioned something about the US investigating and the UN having numbers on the people in a food crisis, but nothing concrete about them actually helping, which is unfortunate.","p016","p024",2,2,2,1.6667
8781,80,366,11,"Person 2","yeah I remember reading that just seems there should be more help","p016","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8782,80,366,12,"Person 1","Agreed. Unfortunately, politics and grudges often take precedence over aid. :/","p016","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
8783,80,366,13,"Person 2","Hopefully this changes soon and they get some help","p016","p024",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
8784,80,366,14,"Person 1","It sounded like Myanmar's government will have to start not denying there's a problem.","p016","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8785,80,366,15,"Person 2","Corrupt government most likely. There has to be some money involved","p016","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
8786,80,366,16,"Person 1","There's always money involved and it's rarely a good thing. It's too bad their democracy bid didn't work out.","p016","p024",3,1.6667,1.6667,2
8787,80,366,17,"Person 2","do you think they can change things around in that country?","p016","p024",2,1,1,1.3333
8788,80,366,18,"Person 1","Last I heard, there's a major genocide threat in Myanmar so it doesn't seem like things will be looking up soon, no. :(","p016","p024",3,2,2,2
8789,80,366,19,"Person 2","Some countries are just too backwards","p016","p024",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8790,80,366,20,"Person 1","I mean, I would argue it's less about them being \"backwards\" and more about centuries-long rivalries, colonization, and outside negative interference than anything intrinsic to them, but. That's a conversation for another day.","p016","p024",2,1.3333,2,2
8791,80,366,21,"Person 2","Agreed. It's been a good talk regardless. bye","p016","p024",2,0,1.3333,1.3333
8792,80,366,22,"Person 1","bye!","p016","p024",1,0.3333,1.3333,1
8793,80,367,0,"Person 1","What did you think about the article?","p022","p019",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
8794,80,367,1,"Person 2","I thought it was a little aggressively written but it got the point across.","p022","p019",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
8795,80,367,2,"Person 1","Agree. I just think that war in general is so terrible.","p022","p019",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
8796,80,367,3,"Person 2","Me too... It's sad too that people try so hard to help, like those doctors and stuff, but there will always be some \"bad guy\" undoing that and making things worse it seems.","p022","p019",2.3333,1.3333,3,2.3333
8797,80,367,4,"Person 1","Yeah.. and the families of those that are in war. All they can do is worry and grieve","p022","p019",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
8798,80,367,5,"Person 2","Yes, they must feel very hopeless","p022","p019",3,2,3.6667,1.6667
8799,80,367,6,"Person 1","It's also sad to know that tehre is absolutely nothing we can do about this.","p022","p019",2.6667,1.3333,3,1.6667
8800,80,367,7,"Person 2","Yah not people like you or me... At some point it has to be up to the higher ups and the people in charge over there.","p022","p019",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
8801,80,367,8,"Person 1","Hopefully they do something because so many innocent people are getting hurt and it's so unfair","p022","p019",2.3333,0.6667,3.3333,1.6667
8802,80,367,9,"Person 2","Agreed... How long has this kind of stuff even been going on? it seems like forever","p022","p019",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
8803,80,367,10,"Person 1","I honestly don't even know but it does seem like forever. We should feel so grateful that we don't have to live life like those people. I can't even imagine","p022","p019",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
8804,80,367,11,"Person 2","Me too! Do you live in the US?","p022","p019",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8805,80,367,12,"Person 1","Yup! I'm just glad to have a roof over my head. You?","p022","p019",2,0,2,2.3333
8806,80,367,13,"Person 2","Same! It definitely makes you appreciate countries like are more when you think about what it could be.","p022","p019",2.3333,0,2.3333,2.3333
8807,80,367,14,"Person 1","Have you ever traveled out of the US?","p022","p019",1.3333,1,1,1
8808,80,367,15,"Person 2","Yes I went to Germany once and some of the surrounding countries. They were all really nice and full of culture. I haven't been to any like none 1st world countries. Hbu?","p022","p019",2,0.6667,1.6667,3
8809,80,367,16,"Person 1","I've been to Thailand but even though it's third world, it's definitely not like the situation that we read in the article","p022","p019",2,1,1.6667,3
8810,80,367,17,"Person 2","Yah that makes sense, did you go to like the touristy areas?","p022","p019",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
8811,80,367,18,"Person 1","Yup mostly visited temples. Looks like that's 10 turns, nice talking to you! bye","p022","p019",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2
8812,80,367,19,"Person 2","bye!","p022","p019",1.3333,1,1,1
8813,80,368,0,"Person 1","I feel like the article said more about Suu Kyi than what actually precipitated the violence.","p030","p073",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8814,80,368,1,"Person 2","Yeah, I didn't find the article really informative. I thought it was a bit confusing.","p030","p073",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.3333
8815,80,368,2,"Person 1","I can understand why the Rohingya are upset though. Despite being born in living their lives in Burma they are being denied any types of citizenship rights and are constantly the victims of violence.","p030","p073",1.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
8816,80,368,3,"Person 2","I agree, I can't imagine living the life that they are trying to live under those conditions.","p030","p073",2,1.6667,3.3333,2
8817,80,368,4,"Person 1","Seems like there is an increasing number of Muslim minorities being used as scapegoats and being forcefully relocated these days. I read that the Rohingya that fled to Bangladesh are no being forced back into Burma. The situation with the forced reeducation of Uyghers in China. Seems like there's a lot going on.","p030","p073",2,2,2.3333,2
8818,80,368,5,"Person 2","Wow, you are really knowledgeable about this. I feel bad I didn't even realize this was going on.","p030","p073",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
8819,80,368,6,"Person 1","Unfortunately, Donald Trump and articles about climate change get more clicks than anything else here in the states. People (myself included) find it really hard to put themselves into these oppressed people's shoes because the idea of living in a makeshift hovel and being persecuted for your religion is such a foreign concept.","p030","p073",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
8820,80,368,7,"Person 2","I completely agree with you on that. If people were more aware of how people are living in other parts of the world, they may realize that the United States is actually a great country to be living in at this time.","p030","p073",2,1,2.3333,2.6667
8821,80,368,8,"Person 1","It's so easy to take things for granted when you are comfortable.","p030","p073",2.6667,1,2,1.6667
8822,80,368,9,"Person 2","Yes, exactly. These Rohingya Muslims probably aren't sitting around worried about plastic straws and thinking of ways to shoot up their classmates.","p030","p073",2.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
8823,80,368,10,"Person 1","I'm inclined to believe that they don't have access to plastic straws or classmates. The Bangladeshi government even removed internet access from the border areas where they are eking out an existence.","p030","p073",1.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
8824,80,368,11,"Person 2","I'm sure they don't. They are barely able to get food. I can't even imagine what it would be like to live there and try to protect my family.","p030","p073",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.3333
8825,80,368,12,"Person 1","Do you think there is a practical solution to the problems they are facing within Burma?","p030","p073",1,1.3333,1,1.3333
8826,80,368,13,"Person 2","I think it must be a very complex situation, or else a solution would have been already found.","p030","p073",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
8827,80,368,14,"Person 1","Considering the fact that making risotto can be a complex situation, I'm inclined to agree. Do you think the current solution is to just have them die in abject poverty? They've been \"working\" on this for years now.","p030","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8828,80,368,15,"Person 2","They probably don't care if they die. What do you think?","p030","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8829,80,368,16,"Person 1","I agree. Knowing what little I do about the situation it seems that they are being blamed for circumstances they have very little control over in order to incite violence against them.","p030","p073",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
8830,80,368,17,"Person 2","Yeah, I don't really get from the article, like you said, what the reasoning behind all of this is.","p030","p073",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
8831,80,368,18,"Person 1","Yeah, we definitely would have profited from more thorough source material. Thanks for chatting! Have a good one. bye","p030","p073",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8832,80,368,19,"Person 2","You too! bye","p030","p073",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8833,80,369,0,"Person 1","they're killing many people in Burma mostly Muslims","p039","p062",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
8834,80,369,1,"Person 2","Yes, these types of conflicts seem to be happening all over the place.  I don't fully understand any of them.","p039","p062",2,1.6667,1.6667,2
8835,80,369,2,"Person 1","people killing other people tale as old as time","p039","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8836,80,369,3,"Person 2","Indeed.  And there's usually some element of ethnic or religious conflict involved.","p039","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8837,80,369,4,"Person 1","yea no one likes muslims","p039","p062",2.3333,2,1,2.3333
8838,80,369,5,"Person 2","They definitely seem to be at the center of a lot of these issues.  And the UN is usually on the periphery, complaining a lot.","p039","p062",2,1.6667,1,2
8839,80,369,6,"Person 1","the UN is useless its there to make people feel better about themselves like their doing something to help","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1,2.3333
8840,80,369,7,"Person 2","I agree.  I think the UN is embarrassing and self-righteous and accomplishes nothing.  I also think Burma has a right to run their own country how they like.  As someone in the article said, this is an internal matter, not an international one.  I tend to agree.","p039","p062",3.3333,2,1,2.6667
8841,80,369,8,"Person 1","exactly we feel this need to police the world when we can barely take care of our own","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
8842,80,369,9,"Person 2","I guess I also feel little sympathy for these cultures that have existed for thousands of years and still haven't found a way to exist peacefully.  People get what they deserve, to some degree.  i guess I'm deterministic like that.","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1.3333,2.6667
8843,80,369,10,"Person 1","survival of the fittest let natural selection take its place","p039","p062",2.3333,2,1,2
8844,80,369,11,"Person 2","Yeah, it sort of works that way whether we intend it to or not.","p039","p062",2,1.6667,1,1.6667
8845,80,369,12,"Person 1","I'm okay with that we need to let some people die off help improve the genome","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1,2.6667
8846,80,369,13,"Person 2","Yeah, we spend too much time allowing the bottom 5% of our culture to dictate its direction and policies.  That seems perfectly upside down and stupid to me.","p039","p062",3.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
8847,80,369,14,"Person 1","idiocracy","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1.3333,2
8848,80,369,15,"Person 2","For sure.  Let's let some microscopic fraction of the population dictate to the huge majority, inconveniencing them and making everything far less efficient.","p039","p062",3.6667,2,1.3333,2
8849,80,369,16,"Person 1","thats the country in a nutshell","p039","p062",2.6667,2,1,1.6667
8850,80,369,17,"Person 2","Yeah, and I fear we'll only continue further in that direction.","p039","p062",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2

8852,80,369,19,"Person 2","Yeah, that's a good point.  We'll get what we deserve.  Probably nothing too great.","p039","p062",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
8853,80,369,20,"Person 1","it was good talking to you goodbye","p039","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333

8877,367,371,2,"Person 1","yeah I feel like the US needs to do a better job of investigating who it supports before supporting them","p024","p022",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
8878,367,371,3,"Person 2","Do you think US investigating will be a good thing or will it hurt the US negatively?","p024","p022",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
8879,367,371,4,"Person 1","it should be good because it would prevent the US from supporting the wrong people.","p024","p022",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,2

8883,367,371,8,"Person 1","agreed. We are lucky to live in this country.","p024","p022",3,0,2.3333,2
8884,367,371,9,"Person 2","Hopefully something is done to prevent more attacks in that country","p024","p022",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8885,367,371,10,"Person 1","do you think they will do something to stop these attacks","p024","p022",2,1,1,1.3333
8886,367,371,11,"Person 2","Probably not. I don't think it's controllable. You?","p024","p022",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
8887,367,371,12,"Person 1","Same. I think its just out of control at this point.","p024","p022",2.3333,2,1,2
8888,367,371,13,"Person 2","The amount of people dying due to war  is terrible to think about.","p024","p022",3.3333,2,2,2
8889,367,371,14,"Person 1","It feels like its been this way ever since humans have been around.","p024","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
8890,367,371,15,"Person 2","Yeah, its sad to see that humans haven't evolved for the better","p024","p022",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
8891,367,371,16,"Person 1","Yep. But then again we evolved from apes so it sort of makes sense.","p024","p022",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
8892,367,371,17,"Person 2","lol good point. Wonder if there's a charity we can donate to.","p024","p022",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
8893,367,371,18,"Person 1","yeah that would be interesting to know","p024","p022",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
8894,367,371,19,"Person 2","Well it was nice talking to you. bye","p024","p022",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
8895,367,371,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p022",1.3333,1,1,1
8896,367,372,0,"Person 1","I do not think that anything will come from these war crime charges.","p035","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
8897,367,372,1,"Person 2","Other than more death, unfortunately.","p035","p016",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
8898,367,372,2,"Person 1","Airstrikes should be banned but it will never happen.","p035","p016",1.6667,2,2,2
8899,367,372,3,"Person 2","I mean, we managed to ban certain gases after WWI, so I don't think it's completely impossible, but it seems more likely that we might get more distinct rules about when you can use them.","p035","p016",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
8900,367,372,4,"Person 1","I feel sorry for the people who are just trying to live their life and get hit by an airstrike.","p035","p016",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
8901,367,372,5,"Person 2","The story about the taxi cab driver was gutting. :(","p035","p016",3,2,3.3333,2
8902,367,372,6,"Person 1","I'm guess there are a lot more stories like that one we will never hear.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
8903,367,372,7,"Person 2","Yeah. It's amazing how hearing statistics like \"4,000 dead\" is sad, but then when you hear just one individual's story it becomes... real, I guess.","p035","p016",2,2,1.6667,2
8904,367,372,8,"Person 1","Do you think the US should stop backing conflicts like this one?","p035","p016",1,1,1,1.3333
8905,367,372,9,"Person 2","I mean I don't think I'm necessarily qualified/informed enough to make that call. But I do think we get involved far too often because we want something, not because we just want to help.","p035","p016",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8906,367,372,10,"Person 1","I agree with you. It is confusing on who the real bad guys are.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
8907,367,372,11,"Person 2","Yeah, partially because often time there are no \"bad guys\" in the black and white sense, just long histories of wrong doings on all sides. :/","p035","p016",2,2,2,2
8908,367,372,12,"Person 1","To me, it feels like the UN has no real power.","p035","p016",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
8909,367,372,13,"Person 2","It seems like it's all posturing and looking imposing without actually /doing/ something most of the time. But then, if they did have power, we'd probably complain about that.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
8910,367,372,14,"Person 1","Do you think we will have another major war in our life time?","p035","p016",1,1,1,1.3333
8911,367,372,15,"Person 2","You mean like a WWIII kind of deal? I think probably no, if only because weapons are so advanced at this point most countries know if we did, it'd be... all kinds of catastrophic. You?","p035","p016",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
8912,367,372,16,"Person 1","I don't know. I think it really depends on when the world starts running out of oil.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1,2
8913,367,372,17,"Person 2","That's true. The situation in Saudi Arabia right now with the attack on the oil producers (idk the technical term) has a lot of people antsy.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
8914,367,372,18,"Person 1","The whole modern world depends on oil. I know I would be screwed if I could not drive my car or get food from the grocery store.","p035","p016",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
8915,367,372,19,"Person 2","True, though there are some promising alternatives that could get funded.","p035","p016",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8916,367,372,20,"Person 1","Yeah, but we need to start applying them now instead of later.","p035","p016",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8917,367,372,21,"Person 2","Which is hard, because many of the oil companies deliberately drop prices when alternatives are being considered for funding to make people less inclined.","p035","p016",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
8918,367,372,22,"Person 1","Once we do switch, I think there will be less wars in the middle east.","p035","p016",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
8919,367,372,23,"Person 2","That's certainly hard to say. We messed a lot of things up when we decided to divide the countries after WWII.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8920,367,372,24,"Person 1","Yeah, but a lot of it about who controls the oil","p035","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1,1.6667
8921,367,372,25,"Person 2","Mm, possibly. Ideological differences make big waves, too.","p035","p016",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
8922,367,372,26,"Person 1","Yeah, I always wonder how people would feel if I told them that God promised me their house and just move in and take it.","p035","p016",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
8923,367,372,27,"Person 2","lol, yeah I don't think that tends to go over well.","p035","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8924,367,372,28,"Person 1","Do you have any other thoughts about the article?","p035","p016",1,1,1,1.3333
8925,367,372,29,"Person 2","I think that about covers it. It was nice talking to you!","p035","p016",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
8926,367,372,30,"Person 1","You too! bye","p035","p016",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
8927,367,372,31,"Person 2","bye!","p035","p016",1,1,1,1
8928,367,373,0,"Person 1","So do you agree with the US involvement in the situation in Yemen or do you think we should let it sort itself out?","p028","p062",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8929,367,373,1,"Person 2","I don't have a problem with us intervening.  It's really a proxy war between Iran and KSA.","p028","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
8930,367,373,2,"Person 1","Yeah i'm a bit on the fence about it myself as i know that the situation in the country will be awful without us but with us there are still innocents being hurt like the taxi driver in the article.","p028","p062",2,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
8931,367,373,3,"Person 2","Yes, they certainly have a tough go of it. But I think Saudi Arabia has a right to defend itself.  Their priority should be to their own citizens, not Yemeni citizens.  That's how I feel.","p028","p062",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
8932,367,373,4,"Person 1","I agree definetely. One thing that i have been wondering though is the location of the sites hits, hospitals etc. it seems like whenever air strikes are involved the collateral gets a bit to high and like resolution in other means should be attempted","p028","p062",2,1.3333,1.3333,2
8933,367,373,5,"Person 2","Yeah, it's hard to know what's going on there.  Sometimes I wonder how much of what we hear is just propaganda from either side.","p028","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,2.3333
8934,367,373,6,"Person 1","Definetely, feels like the only people who know what is actually going on are the civilians and soldiers or volunteers with their boots on the ground.","p028","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
8935,367,373,7,"Person 2","I think it's strange what it said about the U.S. decreasing its advisors to the coalition.  The article said that was distance themselves from it.  But if they had problems with how it was operating, I'd think the better tack would be to increase advisors to have more control over how it's run.","p028","p062",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.3333
8936,367,373,8,"Person 1","Yeah that makes sense, maybe the fix they think is that the current advisors are making mistakes in the way they operate and are trying to narrow it down to fewer key people. Or make that information is getting muddied in translation within the coalition and they are harder to control.","p028","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
8937,367,373,9,"Person 2","Yes, that could be.  I just hope we can find a better way to fight these conflicts with terrorist and rebel groups.  We struggle with these small groups that are embedded in civilian populations.  And when we try to spare the civiliians it makes the job that much tougher.","p028","p062",2,1.3333,2.6667,2
8938,367,373,10,"Person 1","yeah definetely, the real shame and real war crime here is that these rebel groups see the civilian populous as nothing more than a shield that they hide behind to make finding peace more difficult. And with ever strike more of the civilians will aid them and see their side of things.","p028","p062",2.3333,1,2.3333,2.3333
8939,367,373,11,"Person 2","Yes, that's a great point.  I think it's important to remember who started the fighting.  The coalition may not be responding effectively or compassionately, but they wouldn't be fighting at all had it not been the Iranian-backed rebels starting it all.","p028","p062",2,1,2.3333,2.3333
8940,367,373,12,"Person 1","Definetely but still they have a duty to find a resolution and end to the conflict with as little casualties as possible, it seems like often in conflicts like this people only think of the quickest way to end things and rarely the safest way to.","p028","p062",2.3333,1,2.3333,2
8941,367,373,13,"Person 2","It will be interesting to see what happens now after that drone strike on Saudi oil facilities.  That's the country's lifeblood.  That's their entire existence.  They can't stand for that.  I wonder how they respond.","p028","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2
8942,367,373,14,"Person 1","That was one of the first thing i thought of when i heard about the strike. That impacts to many pockets too not have a big response. I hope that the US advisors are able to deter any major response there because it really makes me fear for the civilians if they are not able to.","p028","p062",2,1,2.6667,2
8943,367,373,15,"Person 2","Yes, the response could be severe.  The country already is having financial problems, and that threatens the viability of the monarchy.  So they'll want to strike back hard.  What did it say that taxi driver had?  8 children?  I guess a lot of people in these conflict areas know what it's like to be orphans or lose loved ones.","p028","p062",2,1,2.6667,2
8944,367,373,16,"Person 1","Yeah eight children, and they are definetely all aware of just how dangerous being in the area is as the driver joked with his family he hoped he was able to return that day. What other option do they have to stay though, leave the country and become refugees. So few countries are willing to accept them.","p028","p062",2,1,2.3333,2
8945,367,373,17,"Person 2","Yeah, and Yemen is pretty isolated down there.  Can't even recall which countries they border, other than Saudi Arabia, who certainly doesn't want anything to do with them. Also, the region is mostly desert, which makes migration impossible in many directions.","p028","p062",2,2,1.3333,2
8946,367,373,18,"Person 1","Exactly feels like it is the worst case scenario for the civilians there. Well even though the subject matter was pretty depressing it was nice talking to you. bye","p028","p062",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
8947,367,373,19,"Person 2","Yes, nice chatting with you,too.  Have a nice day.  bye","p028","p062",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
8948,367,374,0,"Person 1","What did you think of this?","p029","p062",0.6667,1,1,1
8949,367,374,1,"Person 2","I think war is a complicated thing.  It's too bad this father of eight died.","p029","p062",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
8950,367,374,2,"Person 1","yeah, those poor eight children and his wife, too.  I think the whole situation over there is senseless honestly.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
8951,367,374,3,"Person 2","It's pretty messy for sure.  I'm not sure what's going to bring it to conclusion.","p029","p062",2,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
8952,367,374,4,"Person 1","seems like nothing","p029","p062",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
8953,367,374,5,"Person 2","That attack on the Saudi oil production facility recently might change things.  That's a true existential threat to the monarchy and country if their oil production--which is their entire economy--goes down.","p029","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
8954,367,374,6,"Person 1","I don't know about that, tell me?","p029","p062",1,1,1,1
8955,367,374,7,"Person 2","There was a recent drone attack on a huge oil facility in KSA that knocked out a huge amount of their production.  Like 50% or something enormous.  At first they said it was a drone strike from Yemen, but then there were accusations it came from Iran itself, or from people inside KSA.  Either way it's backed/supported by Iran, and it's something the Saudi monarchy cannot tolerate if they want to survive, because the stability of their entire country depends on oil production.  So I wonder how they'll respond.  Saving individual Yemeni cab drivers realistically should not be their priority when millions of Saudis existences are at stake.","p029","p062",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
8956,367,374,8,"Person 1","It seems like that would just make the conflict worse, no?  How could it improve things?","p029","p062",1.6667,2,1.6667,1.3333
8957,367,374,9,"Person 2","How does sitting back and taking incoming from Iranian-backed Yemenis, or Iran itself, improve things?","p029","p062",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
8958,367,374,10,"Person 1","It seems like both approaches just make things worse","p029","p062",1.6667,2,2,1.3333
8959,367,374,11,"Person 2","Maybe in the short term.  In the long term KSA needs to defend itself.  War has solved problems in the past, whether you want to admit it or not.","p029","p062",2,1,1.3333,1.6667
8960,367,374,12,"Person 1","I reckon it depends.  SOmetimes it does, sometimes it does not.  It just seems like this one has been going on far too long.  Regardless, it is very sad for all the civilians and innocent victims who have to live in fear every day.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8961,367,374,13,"Person 2","Yeah, it would be very unpleasant to live in such an environment.  We take for granted the relative stability in our society.","p029","p062",2,1.3333,2,2
8962,367,374,14,"Person 1","That's why it irritates me when people complain about America like it is so bad.  We have it so good here and should be grateful.","p029","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
8963,367,374,15,"Person 2","I agree.  We could all use a different perspective at times.  If we turned off our TVs and phones and went outside we'd be amazed how pleasant the world seems compared to how we perceive it online.","p029","p062",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.6667
8964,367,374,16,"Person 1","Yep, exactly.  It is sad, really.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2,1.6667
8965,367,374,17,"Person 2","And the thing is I think people understand that, at least on some level.  But like moths to a flame we seem drawn to things that make us anxious and upset and unhappy.","p029","p062",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
8966,367,374,18,"Person 1","Yes, it is a mystery really.  I must go, take care.  bye","p029","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
8967,367,374,19,"Person 2","Yes, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye","p029","p062",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
8968,367,375,0,"Person 1","I can't imagine what it must be like to live in a war torn country, especially one where the ROE seem not to apply.","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
8969,367,375,1,"Person 2","I agree everyday having to worry about dying i cant imagine","p030","p068",2.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
8970,367,375,2,"Person 1","How do you feel about the U.S. seemingly downplaying their role in war crimes?","p030","p068",1,1.3333,1,1.3333
8971,367,375,3,"Person 2","It is horrible any kind of aid to this is a crime no matter how big or small its like a snowball effect","p030","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
8972,367,375,4,"Person 1","Right? I think our love affair with Saudi Arabia's petro dollars has been nothing but trouble since the start.","p030","p068",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
8973,367,375,5,"Person 2","I agree they should not be given a free pass just because of that they are hurting innocent people","p030","p068",1.3333,1.6667,2,2
8974,367,375,6,"Person 1","Yeah, when you start targeting hospital and starving people it's time to take a step back.","p030","p068",1.3333,1.6667,2,2
8975,367,375,7,"Person 2","exactly now the hospital is shutdown and have to go hours away for help theres going to be no one left","p030","p068",1.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
8976,367,375,8,"Person 1","I have heard a lot about refugees from Syria, I wonder where people are fleeing to from Yemen?","p030","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
8977,367,375,9,"Person 2","oh yes true im sure alot are dying trying to flee two","p030","p068",1.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333
8978,367,375,10,"Person 1","Yeah, not to mention that terrorist have been hitting international aid envoys, so I'm sure a lot of people are too hungry to flee. The whole thing is just heartbreaking.","p030","p068",2.3333,2,3,2
8979,367,375,11,"Person 2","it is and the fact that america has some play in hhuman suffering is terrifying were suppose to be leaders","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
8980,367,375,12,"Person 1","It's so shameful. We're setting such a terrible example of what to do when one wields great power. We seem to have embraced the power while shirking the responsibility that comes with it.","p030","p068",2.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
8981,367,375,13,"Person 2","Yes I think more of the curtain needs to be lifted here for others to see and protest any onvolvement","p030","p068",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
8982,367,375,14,"Person 1","The least they could do is report on more international news without resorting to making it partisan.","p030","p068",1.3333,1,1.3333,2
8983,367,375,15,"Person 2","agreed just get the true facts out these innocent people deserve that","p030","p068",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
8984,367,375,16,"Person 1","I agree. Stuff like that just doesn't get clicks like stories about what Trump tweeted today or global warming get.","p030","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
8985,367,375,17,"Person 2","So true everyone just wants the political drama when theres real life people suffering from our actions","p030","p068",1.6667,2,2,1.6667
8986,367,375,18,"Person 1","I wish I didn't feel so helpless about the situation. Well, thanks for chatting. bye","p030","p068",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
8987,367,375,19,"Person 2","same here. bye","p030","p068",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
8988,91,376,0,"Person 1","What did you think about this article","p019","p028",0.6667,1,1,1
8989,91,376,1,"Person 2","I think it is absolutely disgusting that a pair of parents could do that to their children personally, and i think she should not forgive them or even be in contact with them for what they did.","p019","p028",4.3333,1.6667,4,2.3333
8990,91,376,2,"Person 1","Agreed! It's awful. I can't believe they only got 20 years.","p019","p028",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
8991,91,376,3,"Person 2","That was what i was thinking too, 20 years for scaring your child forever and sexually abusing them. Do you think they have really reconciled with what they did?","p019","p028",3.6667,2,3.3333,2
8992,91,376,4,"Person 1","No I think if someone is evil enough to do that, that evil can't go away. They may have buried it or learned to hide it, but that is evil at it core.","p019","p028",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
8993,91,376,5,"Person 2","I agree, it just goes against too many natural instincts that we as humans have. To think that they could look at their child and only see the money that they could gain from it digusts me. And honestly the fact that they even allowed the mother or father to go on the show seems very wrong to me also.","p019","p028",4,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
8994,91,376,6,"Person 1","Exactly! Yah that seems like a grab for views which is sad on Dr Phils part. He should have focused on the abusee and trying to help her.","p019","p028",3,1.3333,3,2.3333
8995,91,376,7,"Person 2","Definitely,  i know that their show is about making money and saying that the abuser and abusee will confront each other is good for views but i just think about how their parents are once again profiting from their childs abuse and it just makes my skin crawl.","p019","p028",3.6667,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
8996,91,376,8,"Person 1","Ew that's true, I didn't even think about them profitting. That's even worse. I wonder if the daughter will even think it's worth it at that point","p019","p028",3.3333,1.6667,3,2
8997,91,376,9,"Person 2","I don't personally see how it could be but if it gets her any closure or helps her then i guess it is fine.","p019","p028",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
8998,91,376,10,"Person 1","yah thats true","p019","p028",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
8999,91,376,11,"Person 2","What makes me upset is thinking about why she would even do this in the first place. I can only imagine she needs the money from the show or something cause why face these people.","p019","p028",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
9000,91,376,12,"Person 1","That's true, usually people with childhood tramua such as that struggle with holding steady jobs and their finances. So she probably doesn't want the whole world to know those secrets but now they do because she needs the money most likely.","p019","p028",3.3333,1,2.6667,2
9001,91,376,13,"Person 2","maybe she has just come to terms with the experience and now sees it as a paycheck that can also help her get some closure. But yeah that makes sense. I also think it is awful how the mother is claiming it was all the fathers idea and she just gave in to his idea after three months, you don't just become okay with the idea of abusing your child.","p019","p028",3.6667,1.6667,3,2
9002,91,376,14,"Person 1","True a good mother would like divorce or be strongly against the husband/father for even bringing that up in the first place. I would be beyond disgusted if my husband said anything like that","p019","p028",3.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
9003,91,376,15,"Person 2","Exactly or report him to the police or try to get him help, but to give in? Absolutely disgusting and for her to try and just shrug it off as his idea shows she did not learn anything in prison and is still rotten to the core.","p019","p028",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
9004,91,376,16,"Person 1","Agreed... she is just as at fault as she is. Parents are supposed to protect, not enable or roll over and let evil things happen","p019","p028",3.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
9005,91,376,17,"Person 2","Exactly, it really makes me wonder why she was even released from prison if she did not improve or was not rehabilitated in any way  since she clearly doesn't show true remorse.","p019","p028",3.3333,1,2.3333,2
9006,91,376,18,"Person 1","Yah... Also why, if she was \"less' at fault, did they get the same sentence length? IMO life would have been enough for both. There's no reason people like that need freedom and to have the opportunity to hurt someone else.","p019","p028",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
9007,91,376,19,"Person 2","I agree there are certain people who cannot be redeemed and crimes that cannot be forgiven and this is definitely one of them.","p019","p028",2.6667,1,2,2.6667
9008,91,376,20,"Person 1","Agreed. It's been great talking but I think we at 20+ turns right?","p019","p028",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9009,91,376,21,"Person 2","10+ 2 messages count as one turn, but yes it was nice talking to you. bye","p019","p028",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9010,91,376,22,"Person 1","goodbye","p019","p028",1,1,1,1
9011,91,377,0,"Person 1","Well, this was a particularly awful article to read.","p030","p068",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
9012,91,377,1,"Person 2","Yes absolutely gut wrenching, I couldnt imagine being that girl","p030","p068",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
9013,91,377,2,"Person 1","The girl or the parents, frankly.","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
9014,91,377,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I cant believe they are out of jail how unsafe","p030","p068",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
9015,91,377,4,"Person 1","I'm wondering how much hypothetical money it took for these people to behave this way.","p030","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
9016,91,377,5,"Person 2","that is what I was wondering, and how they even found out what kind of people were they talking to or were they watching it themselves","p030","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9017,91,377,6,"Person 1","Yeah, there's a lot of lurid details that inspire curiosity but i'd be comfortable never knowing. Do you think her mother was coerced by her father or do you think the money inspired her to willingly participate?","p030","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
9018,91,377,7,"Person 2","I think maybe he presented the idea to her, but to do that with your daughter i'd think you'd have to be pretty open to the idea","p030","p068",2,2,2,2
9019,91,377,8,"Person 1","Especially the lengths she went to to normalize and encourage the behavior. Honestly, my stomach is churning just thinking about some of the details included in the article. Do you think going on network television with her issue has been a positive or negative experience for the victim?","p030","p068",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
9020,91,377,9,"Person 2","I bet it was a mix. To help others and find some reasoning for what she went through would be positive but having to tell everyone publicly what she went through must be scary and embarissing","p030","p068",2.3333,1.6667,4,2
9021,91,377,10,"Person 1","Yeah, actually i'm more inclined to believe that a person would claim something like this happened to them on TV for money than what is actually being described.","p030","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
9022,91,377,11,"Person 2","yeah maybe for people to feel bad for her and her story and make some money off of it i can see that","p030","p068",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
9023,91,377,12,"Person 1","Do you have an opinion on Dr. Phil?","p030","p068",1,1,1,1
9024,91,377,13,"Person 2","He seems like a very direct guy and doesnt seem to do everything to help these people but more for fame and money im really not to much a fan of a doctor exploiting alot of people for money","p030","p068",2.3333,2,1.3333,2.6667
9025,91,377,14,"Person 1","I think that's an apt evaluation. What do you think would help people in situations like these the most?","p030","p068",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9026,91,377,15,"Person 2","I think they need private counseling without the judgment of the world or audience","p030","p068",1.6667,1,1.6667,2
9027,91,377,16,"Person 1","I agree. Well, thanks for chatting","p030","p068",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9028,91,377,17,"Person 2","Ofcourse you have provided a great partner to bounce ideas off of thank you","p030","p068",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9029,91,377,18,"Person 1","bye","p030","p068",1,1,1,1
9030,91,377,19,"Person 2","bye!","p030","p068",1,0.6667,1,1
9031,91,378,0,"Person 1","Hello","p025","p022",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
9032,91,378,1,"Person 2","Hey there, what did you think about the article?","p025","p022",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
9033,91,378,2,"Person 1","I thought it was horrifying. What did you think?","p025","p022",3,2,3,2
9034,91,378,3,"Person 2","Same here. I can't believe there are people in this world that are that twisted.","p025","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
9035,91,378,4,"Person 1","Yea it is crazy that those kind of people exist.  I feel so bad for the girl.","p025","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2
9036,91,378,5,"Person 2","I hope she is getting the support she needs. I don't think she will ever recover from this but i hope she has a good life.","p025","p022",3.3333,1,4,2
9037,91,378,6,"Person 1","Yeah something like that has to stay with you forever.","p025","p022",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
9038,91,378,7,"Person 2","I wonder what penalty the parents are going to get.","p025","p022",2,1,2,1.6667
9039,91,378,8,"Person 1","In the article it said that they got 20 years for it.","p025","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
9040,91,378,9,"Person 2","I feel like that's too little. They should get life or death penalty. Not only are they pedo, they're involved in incest as well. terrible.","p025","p022",4.3333,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
9041,91,378,10,"Person 1","Yeah I think they should have got life too. It happened in 1996 so they are already out of prison.","p025","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3,2
9042,91,378,11,"Person 2","Wow, i wonder if they've ever tried to contact one another","p025","p022",2.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
9043,91,378,12,"Person 1","They had the mother and daughter on the Dr. Phil show together.","p025","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
9044,91,378,13,"Person 2","I don't think i'd ever be able to forgive my parents if that happened. What about you?","p025","p022",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
9045,91,378,14,"Person 1","I would absolutely never forgive them. I would want to kill them or at the very least never see or talk tot them again.","p025","p022",3.6667,2,4,3
9046,91,378,15,"Person 2","Wow i wouldn't kill them but i definitely would not want to talk to them!","p025","p022",3.6667,1,3,2.6667
9047,91,378,16,"Person 1","Haha yeah I wouldn't actually kill them but I would want to. What do you think about the mother saying that she regrets it and sorry?","p025","p022",3.3333,2,3,3
9048,91,378,17,"Person 2","I feel like it's already too late. The damage is done.. i would not accept it at all!","p025","p022",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3
9049,91,378,18,"Person 1","Yeah I agree. It makes me wonder why she even agreed to see her mother on the show? Maybe she just wanted some answers.","p025","p022",2.6667,1.6667,3,2
9050,91,378,19,"Person 2","Yeah probably. Let's hope everything goes well for the daughter in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye","p025","p022",2.3333,0.3333,3,1.6667

9100,23,381,5,"Person 2","yeah it sounds like the way these people get gas should be more regulated","p019","p068",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9101,23,381,6,"Person 1","I agree... I hope they do something to prevent this happeneing again","p019","p068",2,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667

9104,23,381,9,"Person 2","yes especially the workers that came to help and these people were in so much pain and suffering they must need therapy","p019","p068",3,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
9105,23,381,10,"Person 1","hopefully the government or that company offer some.","p019","p068",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
9106,23,381,11,"Person 2","yeah and some assistance to the families that have lost loved one","p019","p068",2,1.3333,3,1.6667
9107,23,381,12,"Person 1","Yes for sure... they shouldn't have to pay any of those bills","p019","p068",2,1.6667,3,1.6667
9108,23,381,13,"Person 2","i agree and i wonder what the town looks like after such a big explosion probably needs to be rebuilt somewhat","p019","p068",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9109,23,381,14,"Person 1","that's true... do you think there are laws in place that will make them pay for this? I hope so","p019","p068",2,1.3333,2,1.3333
9110,23,381,15,"Person 2","no with s place that you randomly get gas on the side of the road from a truck i bet there laws are iffy","p019","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
9111,23,381,16,"Person 1","that was kind of my thoughts too.... and those people who that happened too were probably not well off...","p019","p068",1.6667,1.6667,2.6667,1.6667
9112,23,381,17,"Person 2","yeah probably very poor lived a not great life then died suffering so sad","p019","p068",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667
9113,23,381,18,"Person 1","it's awful.... and even worse that with not a lot of laws in place probably, this could happen again and again","p019","p068",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
9114,23,381,19,"Person 2","yes true i think this should be on the news and some aid should come help and set up laws","p019","p068",2,1,2.6667,2
9115,23,381,20,"Person 1","agreed. then maybe bigger countries could chime in an help. would you like to keep talking for 5 more turns","p019","p068",1.6667,0.3333,2,1.6667
9116,23,381,21,"Person 2","yes I would like thar, i think bigger countries have responsibility to guide small poorer countries","p019","p068",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,2
9117,23,381,22,"Person 1","i thnk so too because they have the experience","p019","p068",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333

9119,23,381,24,"Person 1","exactly. what else could they do to help you think? send like guidance people down","p019","p068",1.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
9120,23,381,25,"Person 2","yeah maybe create a task force to aid the social and economical aspect of it","p019","p068",1.3333,1,2,1.3333
9121,23,381,26,"Person 1","that's a good idea. And we could send them down to prevent events like that not just after them","p019","p068",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9122,23,381,27,"Person 2","yup a preventative task force train them and then eventually they will have the tools and knowledge to do it themsleves","p019","p068",1,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9123,23,381,28,"Person 1","that would be great. I wonder if anythign like that is in place already? Probably is but it's not that great","p019","p068",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9124,23,381,29,"Person 2","yeah i dont know something needs to be done so this doesnt happen yet again they dont need this death toll with in the society","p019","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667

9127,23,382,0,"Person 1","I would hate to die by fire.","p035","p022",2.3333,2,3,2.3333
9128,23,382,1,"Person 2","It sounds terrible. You have to actually feel the fire burning you before you die.","p035","p022",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
9129,23,382,2,"Person 1","Yeah, what are the odds you go to get fuel and the tanker blows up.","p035","p022",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
9130,23,382,3,"Person 2","It's pretty slim. I feel so bad for the families of the ones that were lost.","p035","p022",3,1.6667,3,2.3333
9131,23,382,4,"Person 1","Me too, and it sounds like they are going to find more bodies.","p035","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
9132,23,382,5,"Person 2","I wish there was a way that i could help. I feel so bad","p035","p022",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
9133,23,382,6,"Person 1","Yeah, stories like this make you be thankful for being alive.","p035","p022",3,0.6667,3,2.6667
9134,23,382,7,"Person 2","I agree. Do you know anyone that's ever been affected by a fire?","p035","p022",2.3333,1,2,1.6667
9135,23,382,8,"Person 1","No and You?","p035","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
9136,23,382,9,"Person 2","A friend of mine had his house burn down before. We were so young so i don't exactly remember what happened.","p035","p022",2,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
9137,23,382,10,"Person 1","did anybody die?","p035","p022",1,1,1.3333,1
9138,23,382,11,"Person 2","Nobody died. Everyone was okay thank the lord.","p035","p022",2,0.3333,2,2
9139,23,382,12,"Person 1","that is a really good thing.","p035","p022",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
9140,23,382,13,"Person 2","What do you think you would do if you survived a fire?","p035","p022",1,1,1,1.3333
9141,23,382,14,"Person 1","I would be a little upset, I would really be thankful for making it out alive. How about you?","p035","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
9142,23,382,15,"Person 2","I would be really angry. I might go into depression and my anxiety would be off the roof.","p035","p022",3.3333,1.6667,3,3
9143,23,382,16,"Person 1","I guess it depends on how much insurance coverage you have on your belongings, but as long as my family makes it out okay, I can buy everything I lost again.","p035","p022",2.6667,1.3333,3,2.3333
9144,23,382,17,"Person 2","Youre right. Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p035","p022",2,0,1.3333,1.3333
9145,23,382,18,"Person 1","you too bye","p035","p022",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1
9146,23,383,0,"Person 1","Pretty awful incident to think about.","p062","p054",2.3333,2,3.3333,2
9147,23,383,1,"Person 2","Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique.","p062","p054",2.6667,2,3,2
9148,23,383,2,"Person 1","Sounds incredibly unlucky, too, in that it might have even started with a lightning strike.","p062","p054",2.6667,2,3,1.6667
9149,23,383,3,"Person 2","Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel.","p062","p054",2.3333,1.3333,3,2
9150,23,383,4,"Person 1","Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there.","p062","p054",2,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
9151,23,383,5,"Person 2","I have to wonder what, if any, safeguards they had in place to prevent such an event, or if its even something that could have been foreseen.","p062","p054",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
9152,23,383,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's probably pretty loosey-goosey I would think.  A type of lifestyle we don't experience.","p062","p054",1.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9153,23,383,7,"Person 2","I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this.","p062","p054",2.6667,2,3.6667,2
9154,23,383,8,"Person 1","Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images.","p062","p054",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
9155,23,383,9,"Person 2","Very much so. And i doubt there will be any type of mental health support for the survivors.","p062","p054",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,1.6667
9156,23,383,10,"Person 1","Yeah, for sure.  I think I'd be hesitant to buy fuel that way in the future, even if it's incredibly unlikely that something like that happens again.","p062","p054",2.3333,1.6667,3,2
9157,23,383,11,"Person 2","Absolutely. I would be terrified to ever do that again. And to think how distraught the families of the victims must be.","p062","p054",3,2,3.6667,2
9158,23,383,12,"Person 1","I remember being in DC during the DC sniper campaign.  I remember standing and pumping my gas and thinking, \"I could get shot at any moment now.\"  Sort of surreal, but we all have to face dangers and uncertainty every day.","p062","p054",3,1.6667,2.6667,3.3333
9159,23,383,13,"Person 2","Events like this really make you ponder your own mortality.","p062","p054",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9160,23,383,14,"Person 1","For sure, and how quickly things can change.  No one could have anticipated that, and I'm sure friends and relatives will ask \"why\" for the rest of their lives.","p062","p054",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
9161,23,383,15,"Person 2","There will certainly be lingering questions of why and whether it could have been prevented. Have you experienced any similar tragedies?","p062","p054",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9162,23,383,16,"Person 1","No, nothing close to that.  I've seen some gnarly car accidents, but those you sort of understand as human error and that type of thing.  Something like this is just totally bonkers.","p062","p054",2,2,2.6667,2.6667
9163,23,383,17,"Person 2","Completely unexpected for sure.","p062","p054",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
9164,23,383,18,"Person 1","Have you ever visited Africa, or Mozambique in particular?","p062","p054",1,1,1,1
9165,23,383,19,"Person 2","I have not, but I have family from Africa. How about you?","p062","p054",1.3333,1,1.3333,2.3333
9166,23,383,20,"Person 1","Never.  My brother has visited a number of countries though, including Mozambique, which he very much enjoyed.  Anyway, nice chatting with you about a sad subject.  Have a nice day.  bye","p062","p054",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.6667
9167,23,383,21,"Person 2","You too. Goodbye","p062","p054",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1
9168,23,384,0,"Person 1","hey what did you think about the article?","p068","p035",0.6667,1,1,1
9169,23,384,1,"Person 2","I would not want to die like that.","p068","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,2
9170,23,384,2,"Person 1","Same here they must have been in immense pain","p068","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9171,23,384,3,"Person 2","Made me think about people who don't have access to a gas station.","p068","p035",1.3333,1,2,1.6667
9172,23,384,4,"Person 1","yes how unsafe is it that thats the way they get highly flammable gas","p068","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9173,23,384,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I wonder what exactly happened.","p068","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9174,23,384,6,"Person 1","Same here how freaky if it was the lightning","p068","p035",2,1,1.6667,1.3333
9175,23,384,7,"Person 2","That would be very freaky","p068","p035",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9176,23,384,8,"Person 1","they should have more safety and procedures for them","p068","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9177,23,384,9,"Person 2","It is probably very unregulated","p068","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9178,23,384,10,"Person 1","how scary this could hurt so many in the future","p068","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9179,23,384,11,"Person 2","They have to take that risk because they do not have any other option","p068","p035",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9180,23,384,12,"Person 1","yup i think the government needs to step in and protect there people","p068","p035",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
9181,23,384,13,"Person 2","that would be nice","p068","p035",1.3333,0,2,1.3333
9182,23,384,14,"Person 1","wonder what will be done","p068","p035",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
9183,23,384,15,"Person 2","sadly to say but I do not think anything will change.","p068","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
9184,23,384,16,"Person 1","probably no money to change things with government","p068","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9185,23,384,17,"Person 2","Maybe they build some central gas stations.","p068","p035",1.3333,1,1,1.3333
9186,23,384,18,"Person 1","it was great talking bye","p068","p035",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1
9187,23,384,19,"Person 2","you too bey","p068","p035",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
9188,23,384,20,"Person 1","bye","p068","p035",1,1,1,1
9189,23,384,21,"Person 2","bye","p068","p035",1,1,1,1
9190,23,385,0,"Person 1","Hi, what did you think of this?","p029","p010",0.6667,1,1,1
9191,23,385,1,"Person 2","It was so sad and horrific.  Your?","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
9192,23,385,2,"Person 1","I agree!  So sad!  and what a random, terrible event.","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
9193,23,385,3,"Person 2","I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it.","p029","p010",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9194,23,385,4,"Person 1","yeah they said either lightning striking or something else","p029","p010",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
9195,23,385,5,"Person 2","I live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary.","p029","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,3.3333
9196,23,385,6,"Person 1","oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me.","p029","p010",3,2,3,3
9197,23,385,7,"Person 2","We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away.","p029","p010",2.6667,2,2,3.3333
9198,23,385,8,"Person 1","Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything.","p029","p010",3,2,2.3333,3.3333
9199,23,385,9,"Person 2","I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina?","p029","p010",1,1,1,1.3333
9200,23,385,10,"Person 1","No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to.","p029","p010",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
9201,23,385,11,"Person 2","That's good - are you a UNC basketball fan?","p029","p010",1,1,1,1
9202,23,385,12,"Person 1","hahaha no just bc I'm not into sports but my mom and my sister both went there.  are you a fan?","p029","p010",1.3333,1,1,2.6667
9203,23,385,13,"Person 2","I love any kind of basketball!    I am a KY wildcat fan.   I went to Vegas a couple of years ago and KY placed UNC.   Daggum Roy :)","p029","p010",2.3333,0,1,3.3333
9204,23,385,14,"Person 1","nice!  I know nothing about either one but it sounds like it was a fun experience.  Anyhow, I think the article said there were a ton of lives lost, what was it like 19 people or was it more?","p029","p010",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9205,23,385,15,"Person 2","It said 19 but they expected to find more charred bodies.   What a terrible way to die - I think it would be horrific","p029","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
9206,23,385,16,"Person 1","wouldn't it?  geez yeah, must have been painful and terrifying all in one.","p029","p010",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
9207,23,385,17,"Person 2","I can't even go there - not sure what is worse - fire or drowning - I think fire would be quicker","p029","p010",3,2,2.3333,2.3333
9208,23,385,18,"Person 1","oh yeah, I can't either.  I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me.","p029","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
9209,23,385,19,"Person 2","Me too - it was nice chatting with you today - goodbye","p029","p010",1.6667,0,1.3333,1.3333
9210,23,385,20,"Person 1","yeah you too!  have a good one, bye!","p029","p010",1.6667,0,1,1.3333
9211,66,386,0,"Person 1","I can't fathom just going about my life like those people and then suddenly everything's upside down.","p008","p029",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
9212,66,386,1,"Person 2","Yeah, it would be really rough, but what a miracle that everyone survived.","p008","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
9213,66,386,2,"Person 1","I know! Like, burn injuries have to suck to heal, but they made it.","p008","p029",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
9214,66,386,3,"Person 2","Yes!  It would be absolutely horrible to lost your home and all your possessions, but such a blessing that at least they have each other.  I think only one person was even in the hospital.","p008","p029",3,1.3333,3,2.3333
9215,66,386,4,"Person 1","Yeah, it said the other two that had injuries were treated on the scene, which is nuts.","p008","p029",2,2,2.6667,1.3333
9216,66,386,5,"Person 2","Yeah, I gathered the injuries must not have been that bad","p008","p029",1.3333,0.3333,2.6667,1.3333
9217,66,386,6,"Person 1","I mean, it described them as \"serious\" but if they were treated on the scene they must have been serious in severity, small in size or something.","p008","p029",1.3333,1,2.3333,1.6667
9218,66,386,7,"Person 2","Yeah good point, that seems contradictory.  But you're right, it must not have been too serious if they just treated them there and let them go.","p008","p029",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9219,66,386,8,"Person 1","Meanwhile, I'm reading it and thinking how I'm an infant about burning my tongue or the roof of my mouth, haha.","p008","p029",1,1.3333,2,2.6667
9220,66,386,9,"Person 2","Oh yeah, I do not like that either.  I burn myself all the time cooking for some reason.  Burns really hurt, can't imagine having a more serious one.","p008","p029",1.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
9221,66,386,10,"Person 1","Did the article say where the person who went to the hospital was burned? It was very vague.","p008","p029",1,1,1.6667,1.3333
9222,66,386,11,"Person 2","It was very vague and short.  I do not remember if it said they were burned or not.  I'm assuming so, would have to be either that or smoke inhalation probably?","p008","p029",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
9223,66,386,12,"Person 1","Probably. I took it to mean they were burned because of the other two people having burns but being treated on scene.","p008","p029",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
9224,66,386,13,"Person 2","yeah I took it the same way.  They definitely did not go into much detail.  Didn't mention the cause of the fire either, did they?","p008","p029",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9225,66,386,14,"Person 1","Just that the gas to the whole neighborhood got shut off. At first I thought that meant it was the gas that caused it, but thinking about it - seems like a standard operating procedure when there's a huge fire.","p008","p029",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9226,66,386,15,"Person 2","Oh yeah good point, to prevent additional fires.","p008","p029",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
9227,66,386,16,"Person 1","Yeah. All it said conclusively was that the investigation was ongoing.","p008","p029",1,1,1.3333,1.3333
9228,66,386,17,"Person 2","Yeah, that is so vague.  It was just like a news snippet really","p008","p029",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
9229,66,386,18,"Person 1","I don't know if that makes it easier or harder to be empathetic - on the one hand we don't know much. On the other hand, that lets our mind fill in a lot of blanks in ways that may make us feel more sympathetic towards the people involved.","p008","p029",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667
9230,66,386,19,"Person 2","Yeah true that!  It could really go either way.  Well it has been great talking to you, I must go.  hope you have a good day, goodbye","p008","p029",2,0,1.3333,1.3333
9231,66,386,20,"Person 1","You too! goodbye","p008","p029",1.3333,0,1.3333,1.3333
9232,66,387,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p019","p016",0.3333,1.3333,1,1
9233,66,387,1,"Person 2","It's really sad, but I'm so glad no one was killed!","p019","p016",2.3333,1,2.6667,1.6667
9234,66,387,2,"Person 1","Right? I thought it would be way worse initially. Still sad but could have been so so much worse","p019","p016",2.3333,1,3.3333,1.6667
9235,66,387,3,"Person 2","Yeah. I feel like as soon as I hear any bad news these days I immediately brace for the worst.","p019","p016",2,1.6667,2.6667,2
9236,66,387,4,"Person 1","Same...I wonder what caused it","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
9237,66,387,5,"Person 2","Oh, I guess it didn't say, did it? That's odd. I feel like a gas leak is usually the suspect.","p019","p016",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
9238,66,387,6,"Person 1","I dont think so.... and yah that would seem most common. I wonder if anyone will sue the landlord. I would haha","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
9239,66,387,7,"Person 2","Haha, probably depends on what they can afford, honestly. If only eight people were inside it must have been small.","p019","p016",2,0.6667,2,1
9240,66,387,8,"Person 1","That's true.... I've always had bad landlords, but if it were a nice guy who I knew I might think twice and just be glad it wasn't worse","p019","p016",2,1,2.6667,2
9241,66,387,9,"Person 2","Yeah. I feel like it would also depend on how bad my injuries were — like, are we talking smoke inhalation or 3rd degree burns?","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
9242,66,387,10,"Person 1","true, it would not be worth it for simple things like some inhalation.","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1
9243,66,387,11,"Person 2","I wonder how the people outside the apartment got hurt. There was an explosion, right? I wouldn't want to get caught in that.","p019","p016",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1
9244,66,387,12,"Person 1","Maybe like debris flying or something like that? It said minor so they probably just got knicked with something","p019","p016",1.3333,1.6667,2,1
9245,66,387,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I think only one person had to go to the hospital, so the explosion must have happened in an area a decent distance from the inhabitants.","p019","p016",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
9246,66,387,14,"Person 1","That would make sense yah, which is good. It probably means the building was like set up like it was supposed to be, safety wise and all","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,2,1
9247,66,387,15,"Person 2","Yeah. I wonder if they had to find somewhere else to live, at least while the investigation's underway?","p019","p016",1.3333,1.3333,2,1
9248,66,387,16,"Person 1","Hopefully they did, i didn't think about that. I hope there is some sort of law or policy in place that the landlord would have to pay for a hotel for them or something","p019","p016",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
9249,66,387,17,"Person 2","It'd definitely be the respectable thing to do. I wonder if any of the building was salvageable.","p019","p016",1.3333,0.6667,2.3333,1
9250,66,387,18,"Person 1","Hopefully so... it didn't have much detail on all that. and hopefully not a lot of people's stuff was ruined! that would suck","p019","p016",2,1.3333,2.3333,1
9251,66,387,19,"Person 2","Ooooh, yeah, that would be awful! Especially if you'd lived there a long time and had lots of memories and stuff. :(","p019","p016",3,2,3,1.3333
9252,66,387,20,"Person 1","I know! To just have it all be gone in a moment, no warning. That would really really suck, on top of being injured and not having a place to stay.","p019","p016",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.3333
9253,66,387,21,"Person 2","Eeeep. My worst nightmare :/","p019","p016",3.3333,2,3,1.6667
9254,66,387,22,"Person 1","Same here....and those things can't be brought back with time or money.","p019","p016",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
9255,66,387,23,"Person 2","Yeah. :( Well, I think that's about everything... did anything else in the article strike you?","p019","p016",2,1.6667,1.3333,1
9256,66,387,24,"Person 1","do you want to go for like three more turns to get the bonus? We could talk about insurance on it and stuff","p019","p016",1,1,1,1
9257,66,387,25,"Person 2","Sure, that's fine! I know most people have to have rental insurance; does that cover fire damage?","p019","p016",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
9258,66,387,26,"Person 1","When I had mine it did, and it would cover the cost to replace any damaged or destroyed items","p019","p016",1.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
9259,66,387,27,"Person 2","That's good, hopefully everyone involved will have that. I wonder if the people just on the street will get anything for health insurance.","p019","p016",1.6667,0.6667,2,1
9260,66,387,28,"Person 1","I hope so too... I know a lot of my friends who rent don't. Which is silly cause it's like 10 bucks a month. They probably could get it covered by the property owners insurance","p019","p016",1.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
9261,66,387,29,"Person 2","Eep, that's not a good idea. Renter's insurance is super cheap comparatively and can save you a lot of heartache. I had a pipe on the washing machine break one time and it flooded the whole floor. No insurance would've been a nightmare.","p019","p016",2,1,2.3333,3
9262,66,387,30,"Person 1","Oh yes that would have been awful! Even just for the peace of mind it's worth it. I think that is 15 turns. Are you ready to be done?","p019","p016",1.6667,1,2,1
9263,66,387,31,"Person 2","Yep, I'm good. :) It was great talking with you!","p019","p016",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9264,66,387,32,"Person 1","you too! goodbye!","p019","p016",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1
9265,66,387,33,"Person 2","bye!","p019","p016",1,0.6667,1.3333,1
9266,66,388,0,"Person 1","it was good that no one died in the fire","p039","p054",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1
9267,66,388,1,"Person 2","Yes but also upsetting that ten were injured","p039","p054",2.3333,2,2.6667,1
9268,66,388,2,"Person 1","yes the firefighters did a good job","p039","p054",1.6667,0.3333,1.6667,1
9269,66,388,3,"Person 2","Yes geting it under control in about ten minutes is impressive","p039","p054",2,0.3333,2,1.3333
9270,66,388,4,"Person 1","absoulutely that was proffessional","p039","p054",2,0.3333,2,1
9271,66,388,5,"Person 2","They said that the fire was caused by an explosion but they dont know how the explosion happened.","p039","p054",1,1.3333,1.6667,1
9272,66,388,6,"Person 1","could be a gas leak?","p039","p054",0.6667,1,1,1
9273,66,388,7,"Person 2","Perhaps. Gas leaks can be quite scary","p039","p054",1.6667,2,2,1.3333
9274,66,388,8,"Person 1","yes big explosions","p039","p054",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
9275,66,388,9,"Person 2","I hope nobodys homes were destroyed in the apartment complex fire.","p039","p054",2,1.6667,2.6667,1
9276,66,388,10,"Person 1","I hope they find a place to live","p039","p054",1.6667,1,2,1
9277,66,388,11,"Person 2","Yes i hope the complex at least sets them up with some temporary housing while they rebuild","p039","p054",1.6667,1,2,1
9278,66,388,12,"Person 1","that would be nice but probably not","p039","p054",1.6667,1,1.6667,1
9279,66,388,13,"Person 2","And often renters dont carry renters insurance so im not certain they will be reimbursed for their damaged belonginga","p039","p054",1.3333,1,1.6667,1
9280,66,388,14,"Person 1","slip through the cracks of society","p039","p054",1,1.3333,1.6667,1
9281,66,388,15,"Person 2","True. I hope those who were hospitalized can recover quickly.","p039","p054",1.6667,1.3333,2,1.3333
9282,66,388,16,"Person 1","yep probably no health insurance to cover it","p039","p054",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1
9283,66,388,17,"Person 2","Thats a tough situation to be in","p039","p054",2,1.3333,2,1
9284,66,388,18,"Person 1","absoulutely at least we're in america and not somalia","p039","p054",2,1,2,1.3333
9285,66,388,19,"Person 2","Yes I suppose it could always be worse","p039","p054",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
9286,66,388,20,"Person 1","nice talking to you goodbye","p039","p054",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1
9287,66,388,21,"Person 2","goodbye","p039","p054",1,0.6667,1,1
9288,66,389,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p024","p010",0.6667,1.3333,1,1
9289,66,389,1,"Person 2","It was sad.   I was just glad to see that only one person was hurt and had to go to the hospital","p024","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9290,66,389,2,"Person 1","yeah the fact that eight people suffered minor injuries only is amazing","p024","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.3333
9291,66,389,3,"Person 2","I can't imagine what they feel watching their home and all the contents perish.","p024","p010",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
9292,66,389,4,"Person 1","imagine the memories of people they no longer have with them like a grandparent being burned away in front of you like that.","p024","p010",3.3333,2,4,1.3333
9293,66,389,5,"Person 2","I wonder what caused it - no reference of anything in the article","p024","p010",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
9294,66,389,6,"Person 1","yeah the article was too short for my liking","p024","p010",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9295,66,389,7,"Person 2","Me too - it was like - here's the fire that destroyed everything - and not much else","p024","p010",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.3333
9296,66,389,8,"Person 1","yeah seems like I wrote that article and not a professional","p024","p010",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
9297,66,389,9,"Person 2","Agreed - articles tend to be either so very long and technical I get lost or so short you really do not know what the intent was in the written piece.","p024","p010",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
9298,66,389,10,"Person 1","yeah what I feel like is that journalist should have been at the scene asking questions to get a good picture of what really happened , they probably dont do it like that anymore though and just get information from other sources","p024","p010",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
9299,66,389,11,"Person 2","Just sensationalism - it's why I don't follow the news anymore - it's slanted and full of errors.  It's just all opinions - I don't care what opinion the journalist has - just interview and write it accordingly","p024","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
9300,66,389,12,"Person 1","yeah me and you can both be journalists nowadays. dont get me wrong its still tough work but it seems easier than the old days when they had to go out and get the news and not get it from the information from another site. i also dont follow the news anymore its a shame what has happened to media","p024","p010",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.6667
9301,66,389,13,"Person 2","I know - Tom Brokaw was my favorite - he wrote a book titled \"The Greatest Generation\".   t was so well written.   Social Media is the worst thing ever","p024","p010",2.3333,1,1,2.6667
9302,66,389,14,"Person 1","agreed about social media. has brought bad things more so than good. Everyone is just trying to get the most likes or retweets and at the end of the day that gets us nowhere. We have devolved instead of evolved like other species do.","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1,2.3333
9303,66,389,15,"Person 2","or bully people all day long.  Little 10 year olds committing suicide - and where are the parents - why does a 10 year old have access to social media - insance","p024","p010",3.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
9304,66,389,16,"Person 1","yeah so many children committing suicide because the kids at school make fun of them online because of the clothes they wear to school, or how their body is shaped. It's crazy","p024","p010",3.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
9305,66,389,17,"Person 2","it's just sad","p024","p010",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333
9306,66,389,18,"Person 1","reading through the article again it seems that this complex probably lacked a good plan for these types of tragedies","p024","p010",2,2,1.3333,1.3333
9307,66,389,19,"Person 2","Agreed - seldom are their exit plans in apartment complexes","p024","p010",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9308,66,389,20,"Person 1","yeah. it was a good talk by the way. bye","p024","p010",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1

9310,66,390,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article??","p022","p068",1.3333,1,1,1
9311,66,390,1,"Person 2","I am grateful no one died","p022","p068",3,0,2,1.3333
9312,66,390,2,"Person 1","me too but it's scary because of someone else's accident","p022","p068",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
9313,66,390,3,"Person 2","yes makes me think of my own building it could happen here","p022","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
9314,66,390,4,"Person 1","exactly! I would b so mad if my neighbor caused an accident that did me any harm","p022","p068",4,2,3,1.6667
9315,66,390,5,"Person 2","yup and then ruined all your stuff","p022","p068",3.3333,1.6667,2,1
9316,66,390,6,"Person 1","I agree. I hope these people learn from this stupid mistake.","p022","p068",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333

9331,270,391,1,"Person 2","I thought it was sad just due to the massive loss of life, what did you think?","p019","p029",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
9332,270,391,2,"Person 1","I think it's awful... So much loss. and it could have been prevented","p019","p029",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667
9333,270,391,3,"Person 2","Yes seriously, these mines are too dangerous","p019","p029",3,2,2.3333,1.3333
9334,270,391,4,"Person 1","Agreed, and they could be so much safer if they had just put in the vetilation. But they were trying to be cheap.","p019","p029",3.3333,1,2.6667,1.3333
9335,270,391,5,"Person 2","Yep, sounds so typical.  Putting profits over the lives of humans","p019","p029",4,1,2.3333,1.6667
9336,270,391,6,"Person 1","23 humans... that's a small number but think about that. 23 whole people. 23 families. all so someone could get a little bit richer.","p019","p029",4,1.6667,3,1.3333
9337,270,391,7,"Person 2","Yeah, I was feeling awful for the families.  They all lost a husband, a father","p019","p029",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.6667

9340,270,391,10,"Person 1","I hope something will be done to punish those people that caused this","p019","p029",3.6667,1,2,1.3333
9341,270,391,11,"Person 2","Yes, although I would say it seems unlikely.  It seems like these things tend to go unpunished, like the factories in INdia that collapse and kill hundreds of workers","p019","p029",3,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
9342,270,391,12,"Person 1","Yah they do have a track record of that... Probably pay someone off or something","p019","p029",3,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
9343,270,391,13,"Person 2","Yeah, it seems especially bad in certain countries","p019","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
9344,270,391,14,"Person 1","Yes, the poorer ones, where the officials in charge have way too much power","p019","p029",3,1.6667,1.6667,1
9345,270,391,15,"Person 2","Yes, and there is always so much corruption amongst those in power","p019","p029",3,2,1.6667,1.3333
9346,270,391,16,"Person 1","For sure... so sad, money over human lives","p019","p029",3.6667,1.3333,2,1
9347,270,391,17,"Person 2","Yeah, that is the ultimate tragedy right there","p019","p029",4,1.3333,2.3333,1
9348,270,391,18,"Person 1","And the two people who survived, I bet they are traumatized","p019","p029",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333

9351,270,392,0,"Person 1","What did you think about the article?","p022","p068",0.3333,1,0.6667,1
9352,270,392,1,"Person 2","is is so sad these people died such a preventative death","p022","p068",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
9353,270,392,2,"Person 1","It's terrible because it's something you can't avoid or fight","p022","p068",3.6667,2,3.3333,2
9354,270,392,3,"Person 2","but there should be something like osha to protect these workers","p022","p068",1.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
9355,270,392,4,"Person 1","I agree. This reminds me of the case that happened in Thailand with the boys.","p022","p068",1.3333,1,2,2
9356,270,392,5,"Person 2","oh yes but atleast they lived i feel so bad for the victims families","p022","p068",2.6667,2,3,2

9358,270,392,7,"Person 2","yeah me niether must just be always in the back of your mind","p022","p068",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9359,270,392,8,"Person 1","Definitely. I can't even begin to think of what the people in the cave were thinking or feeling. THey must have been so scared","p022","p068",3,2,2.6667,2
9360,270,392,9,"Person 2","yeah i would need to move or have therapy to keep my sanity","p022","p068",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
9361,270,392,10,"Person 1","Have you ever been in a cave before?","p022","p068",1,1,1,1.3333
9362,270,392,11,"Person 2","no i get clostophobic!","p022","p068",3.3333,1.3333,2,2.6667
9363,270,392,12,"Person 1","Same here! I am also afraid of the dark and i get hungry easily. Those people in the cave must have been suffering.","p022","p068",3.3333,2,2.6667,3
9364,270,392,13,"Person 2","Yes i couldnt imagine i would have a bunch of anxiety attacks","p022","p068",3.3333,2,2.6667,3
9365,270,392,14,"Person 1","I think i would faint or start screaming for no reason","p022","p068",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.6667
9366,270,392,15,"Person 2","yup me two and having to go to the bathroom...","p022","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
9367,270,392,16,"Person 1","Agreed. I wonder how long it took before the people in the cave died","p022","p068",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9368,270,392,17,"Person 2","that is so sad to think about because it was probably slow and painful","p022","p068",4,2,3,2
9369,270,392,18,"Person 1","Let's hope they're fine in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p068",2,0.6667,2,2
9370,270,392,19,"Person 2","you two! bye","p022","p068",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
9371,270,393,0,"Person 1","Ugh. This was really hard to read :(","p016","p024",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
9372,270,393,1,"Person 2","yeah that was terrible to read, what do you think can be done to prevent these accidents?","p016","p024",2.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
9373,270,393,2,"Person 1","From what I understand, a lot of times these things happen because companies are just cutting to many corners involving safety and maintenance. :/","p016","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,1
9374,270,393,3,"Person 2","yeah saving money can cause these things to happen","p016","p024",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1
9375,270,393,4,"Person 1","Natural disasters are always hard, but there's something about hearing that rescuers worked for so long and then just found they were already dead. It's an extra level of heart break.","p016","p024",2,2,2.6667,1
9376,270,393,5,"Person 2","Imagine the family members of the victims finding this out","p016","p024",2,2,3.3333,1
9377,270,393,6,"Person 1","I guess knowing for sure is better than just living in that question, but still... ouch. :(","p016","p024",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.3333
9378,270,393,7,"Person 2","you're right I'd rather know than be up all night worrying","p016","p024",1.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
9379,270,393,8,"Person 1","Yeah. This article kinda reminds me of the aftermath of 9/11, when they had rescue dogs looking for people and they couldn’t find anyone, and the dogs got so depressed rescuers started pretending to be lost just so the dogs would have someone to find. :(","p016","p024",2,2,3,1.6667
9380,270,393,9,"Person 2","wow never heard about that, that really is depressing :(","p016","p024",2.6667,2,3,1.3333
9381,270,393,10,"Person 1","Yeah. And then there was this other situation in Mexico where there was an earthquake and it took out a school, and there were no survivors so officials just made up a story about a 12 year old girl being alive to boost morale. :/","p016","p024",2.6667,2,3,1
9382,270,393,11,"Person 2","sometimes you have to boost the morale of the workers I guess. I'd probably do the same :(.","p016","p024",2.3333,0.6667,3.3333,1.6667
9383,270,393,12,"Person 1","Yeah. Sometimes having hope is more important than there actually being one.","p016","p024",2,0.3333,2.3333,1.3333
9384,270,393,13,"Person 2","yeah when you have hope you stay sane","p016","p024",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1
9385,270,393,14,"Person 1","Yeah. If you ever want to get simultaneously frustrated, heartbroken, and understanding, the fake girl's name was \"Frida Sofia\" and there's plenty of articles on it. But. Anyway.","p016","p024",2,2,3,1
9386,270,393,15,"Person 2","Ima have to look that up thats interesting.","p016","p024",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
9387,270,393,16,"Person 1","Indeed. Going back to the situation in China, it's kind of alarming that there are over 1,000 mining operations that they can shut down for being outdated.","p016","p024",1.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1
9388,270,393,17,"Person 2","Also the fact that they overlook maintenance","p016","p024",1,1.3333,1.6667,1
9389,270,393,18,"Person 1","Yeah. No wonder they're the most dangerous country for mining accidents.","p016","p024",1.3333,2,1.6667,1
9390,270,393,19,"Person 2","well i think theyre known for lower quality products as well. Judging by this article it seems like their coal mines as well.","p016","p024",1.3333,2,1.6667,1
9391,270,393,20,"Person 1","Things almost always go poorly when you care more about profit than about people.","p016","p024",2,2,1.6667,1.3333
9392,270,393,21,"Person 2","Money really is the root of all evil","p016","p024",1.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333
9393,270,393,22,"Person 1","For sure.","p016","p024",1.3333,1.3333,1,1
9394,270,393,23,"Person 2","Well its been a good talk I enjoyed it very much! bye","p016","p024",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1
9395,270,393,24,"Person 1","bye!","p016","p024",1,0.6667,1.3333,1

9397,270,394,1,"Person 2","That was such a sad article regarding China miners","p010","p030",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
9398,270,394,2,"Person 1","Yeah, I can't imagine what it must have been like for the families waiting for them to be dug out of what ended up being their tomb.","p010","p030",3,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
9399,270,394,3,"Person 2","I live in Colorado but grew up in Kentucky.   So many miners died in Eastern Kentucky.  In comparison, there seems that China was incredibly terrible at giving the miners a safe work space.","p010","p030",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
9400,270,394,4,"Person 1","I don't think that mining will ever be considered a \"safe\" profession. Accidents happen.","p010","p030",1.6667,2,2,1.6667
9401,270,394,5,"Person 2","Yes they did.  I just always wondered how painful these accidents to those who just suffocate in the mine waiting on people to get to them.","p010","p030",2,1.6667,3,2
9402,270,394,6,"Person 1","Slowly asphyxiating would be a horrible way to go, but with 33 people breathing they probably didn't have to wait long/","p010","p030",2,2,3.3333,2
9403,270,394,7,"Person 2","Let's hope so.   As you already stated, the families waiting on the miners to be retrieved must be an experience that most never encounter.","p010","p030",2,1.6667,4,2
9404,270,394,8,"Person 1","The weight of what little hope they had to see their loved one alive again must have been difficult to bear.","p010","p030",2.6667,1.6667,4,2
9405,270,394,9,"Person 2","All deaths are sad; however, this seems to be more challenging.  It would be an image I would never forget.","p010","p030",3.3333,2,3,1.6667
9406,270,394,10,"Person 1","Have you ever experienced the death of a loved one?","p010","p030",1,1,1,1.3333
9407,270,394,11,"Person 2","I have.   I lost my dad at the age of 40.   He left 3 girls - 17, 15, 12.   My mom died at 76 of alzheimer's.   What about you?","p010","p030",3,1.6667,2.6667,4
9408,270,394,12,"Person 1","I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my best friend of 17 years at 22. My parents and grandparents are all still living and healthy.","p010","p030",3,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
9409,270,394,13,"Person 2","Your friend was so very young.  I'm sorry.   Enjoy your family every day because you just never know when that day comes.","p010","p030",2.6667,1,3,2.6667
9410,270,394,14,"Person 1","We try to get together often. Did the article mention what they were actually mining for?","p010","p030",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9411,270,394,15,"Person 2","It did.  It was coal.  China is the biggest producer of coal as well as consuming it.","p010","p030",1,1.3333,1.3333,2
9412,270,394,16,"Person 1","It mentioned that they used ventilation fail safes to keep gas pockets from forming in the mines. Do you know how something like that works?","p010","p030",1,1,1,1.6667
9413,270,394,17,"Person 2","I don't.   I got to go in one deep coal mine because I made loans to those miners.   The only thing I saw were huge fans and they were vented out of the earth.  I do not know if that is the same thing though.","p010","p030",1.3333,1,1.6667,2.6667
9414,270,394,18,"Person 1","I wonder what the average age of a Chinese miner is.","p010","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
9415,270,394,19,"Person 2","Just guessing I would think 18-65.   The State of Administration of Work Safety ordered an investigate of what happened.   I don't understand why they were not inspected more closely.","p010","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9416,270,394,20,"Person 1","Unfortunately, it usually takes tragedies like this for safety and procedure to be altered and followed more closely. Thanks for chatting today. bye","p010","p030",2,2,2,2

9419,270,395,1,"Person 2","I do not believe anything China says about investigating.   All workers are in unsafe working environments","p068","p010",1.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333

9427,270,395,9,"Person 2","Yes all kinds of drama.   One tweet set it all off.   Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong.    It was all about China's counter-extremism where 2 million are forced into re-education camps.  Insane.","p068","p010",3,2,1.3333,2
9428,270,395,10,"Person 1","wow it is crazy how other places are set up i could not imagine living in a communistic country","p068","p010",3,2,1.6667,2.3333

9440,368,396,2,"Person 1","Interesting how? They changed their mind because he started choking them and being aggressive","p019","p039",3,1.3333,2.6667,1

9442,368,396,4,"Person 1","They were having consensual sex. and then changed their mind. There is nothing wrong with that. are you trying to blame them?","p019","p039",2.6667,1.6667,3,1
9443,368,396,5,"Person 2","there needs to be a sex waiver form with check lists","p019","p039",1.6667,1.6667,1,1.6667
9444,368,396,6,"Person 1","No people need to know what the words \"no\" and \"stop\" mean. Simple as that.","p019","p039",3.3333,1.6667,3,1.3333

9450,368,396,12,"Person 1","and I get that, and those are the iffy situations especially if both parties are drunk. But those aren't the majority of cases. and then it's mindsets like that that can hurt or delay the real victims getting the help they need","p019","p039",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
9451,368,396,13,"Person 2","I agree but we live in a victim culture now where everyone is offended and victimized I think we are letting it get out of hand and the women who are bringing up frivoulous cases are hindering the real victims of sexual abuse","p019","p039",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
9452,368,396,14,"Person 1","I agree with the second part of that yah... They are doing an injustice to the real victims.","p019","p039",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333

9454,368,396,16,"Person 1","Yup... but that is the same kind of case with a lot of things. Like that chick who spilt hot coffee all over her and sued mcdonalds. A lot of people tried to follow in suit for silly things like that, and it made real suing cases seem less real","p019","p039",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333

9473,368,397,10,"Person 1","yeah just feel awful for these women","p068","p024",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2

9484,368,398,0,"Person 1","So this was clearly a sad situation, although I am glad they have caught the guy.  What did you think?","p029","p016",3,1.6667,2.6667,2
9485,368,398,1,"Person 2","I hate that he got away with hurting so many women before he was caught :(","p029","p016",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
9486,368,398,2,"Person 1","yeah no doubt, and probably even more than they know about","p029","p016",3,1.3333,2.3333,2
9487,368,398,3,"Person 2","Agreed. I hope he gets a better sentence than that athlete from awhile back >.>","p029","p016",3.3333,0.6667,2,2
9488,368,398,4,"Person 1","Yeah the famous athletes always seem to get a free pass.","p029","p016",3,1,1.6667,1.6667
9489,368,398,5,"Person 2","It's ridiculous. Like, they have clear evidence that they did it so it's not like it's up for debate, and then they get like three months or something.","p029","p016",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
9490,368,398,6,"Person 1","yes seriously  disgusting really","p029","p016",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
9491,368,398,7,"Person 2","Yeah. What did you think of his lawyer's plea at the end of the article? About \"politically correct culture\" swaying opinion of the case?","p029","p016",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
9492,368,398,8,"Person 1","I think it's ridiculous, just a diversion tactic.  What did you think","p029","p016",3.3333,1.6667,2,2.6667
9493,368,398,9,"Person 2","100% agree with you. Everyone's against him because he's been caught, not because of some agenda.","p029","p016",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
9494,368,398,10,"Person 1","Yeah, he is just trying to politicize the issue","p029","p016",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
9495,368,398,11,"Person 2","Yeah. The only disturbing thing about him being \"only a student/only 20\" or whatever is that he's already managed to assault FIVE women. Bro clearly has no intention of shaping up.","p029","p016",4,2,2.3333,2.3333
9496,368,398,12,"Person 1","No doubt!!!  At such a young age.  And probabloy way more women than that","p029","p016",3.6667,2,2,2
9497,368,398,13,"Person 2","Mmmmmhm. The statistics on assault are horrifying; especially on campuses. Do you have any opinions on what should be done about it?","p029","p016",3.6667,2,2.3333,2
9498,368,398,14,"Person 1","I am really not sure.  I guess awareness is a big thing.  What do you think??","p029","p016",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
9499,368,398,15,"Person 2","Awareness, better accountability. There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea.","p029","p016",2.6667,0.6667,2.3333,2.3333
9500,368,398,16,"Person 1","Oh yeah, I am sure that plays a big role.  These kids are clearly way too young to be drinking, they need better enforcement of the laws","p029","p016",3,0.6667,2,2
9501,368,398,17,"Person 2","Yeah. I think dry campuses are the way to go. Like, if you want to live off campus and drink no one can stop you, but the level of blackout drinking at like frat parties or whatever is a bad idea.","p029","p016",2.6667,0.6667,2,2.3333
9502,368,398,18,"Person 1","I strongly agree, and I used to drink a lot.  I quit, but I think it is very harmful, especially for young adults and kids, which these 18 year olds are","p029","p016",3,0.6667,2.3333,3.3333
9503,368,398,19,"Person 2","Yeah. Your brain's not even fully developed until 25 and when you're chugging 7, 8, 9 beers at 18... Yipes.","p029","p016",3,1.6667,2,2
9504,368,398,20,"Person 1","Yeah exactly, frontal lobe is still developing.  That's a pretty critical part of the brain.  Well I must go, it has been good speaking with you.  goodbye","p029","p016",2,0,2,2
9505,368,398,21,"Person 2","bye!","p029","p016",1.6667,0.6667,1,1.3333
9506,368,399,0,"Person 1","This article was very difficult for me to read.  So much of it was horrendous.","p010","p035",4.3333,2,2.6667,2
9507,368,399,1,"Person 2","I know, I think he is guilty.","p010","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
9508,368,399,2,"Person 1","Well me too with all that came forward.  There are few times when someone is accused not to be guilty.","p010","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
9509,368,399,3,"Person 2","I agree, but it seemed like he liked doing the same thing to different women.","p010","p035",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
9510,368,399,4,"Person 1","I have no inkling why men rape women.  There are many who willingly want to do that.  I know people say it's power.  That still makes no sense.","p010","p035",2.6667,2,2,2
9511,368,399,5,"Person 2","I agree. I can't understand rapist and pedophiles","p010","p035",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
9512,368,399,6,"Person 1","I found it odd the article including nothing about what UW-Madison was doing, investigating, policies, etc.","p010","p035",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9513,368,399,7,"Person 2","They say college campuses is where most rapes occur.","p010","p035",1.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
9514,368,399,8,"Person 1","Look at all that went on at Michigan State University and as far as I know nothing has happened.","p010","p035",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
9515,368,399,9,"Person 2","I agree, I think it is worst when athletes are involved because it is pushed under the table.","p010","p035",2.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
9516,368,399,10,"Person 1","It is.  Kansas has been the same way - just excuse it all.   I found it interesting how first the legal team was saying innocent until proven guilty but clammed up when the additional ones came forward.  It then became no comment.","p010","p035",2.3333,2,2,2
9517,368,399,11,"Person 2","That is why I think he did it, too many coming forward.","p010","p035",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9518,368,399,12,"Person 1","He preyed on so many.   Drugs, social media, consensual, non-consensual, etc.  It seemed everyone was a target.","p010","p035",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
9519,368,399,13,"Person 2","I'm glad he can't do this to anymore women.","p010","p035",3,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
9520,368,399,14,"Person 1","Me too.   I so feel for the victims and what they will carry forever.","p010","p035",3.6667,1,3.3333,1.6667
9521,368,399,15,"Person 2","Me too, I would not wish that on anybody.","p010","p035",3.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
9522,368,399,16,"Person 1","Most of the world is a good place but sometimes I think so may horrendous things you hear about - will it change?","p010","p035",3.3333,1,1.6667,2
9523,368,399,17,"Person 2","Sadly I do not think it will change.","p010","p035",3.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
9524,368,399,18,"Person 1","People have been killing or hurting each other since the beginning of the time.","p010","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1,2.3333
9525,368,399,19,"Person 2","It is in some of our nature to do these things.","p010","p035",1.6667,2,1,2
9526,368,399,20,"Person 1","All the complicated genetics.","p010","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1,1.6667
9527,368,399,21,"Person 2","I agree. The world is beautiful and scary at the same time.","p010","p035",2.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
9528,368,399,22,"Person 1","Yes it is.   My guess is will be imprisoned for a very long time.  Of course, juries are so undependable - you just never know if they will convict.","p010","p035",2.3333,2,1,2
9529,368,399,23,"Person 2","I think people should only go to prison when they harm other people","p010","p035",2.3333,1.6667,1,2.3333
9530,368,399,24,"Person 1","Me too.   People going to jail because they did something to themselves is ridiculous.  Get them help.   It's why prisons are running over with inmates","p010","p035",3.3333,1.6667,1,2.3333
9531,368,399,25,"Person 2","I agree, it was talking chatting with you! bye","p010","p035",2,0.6667,1,1.3333

9536,368,400,3,"Person 2","Agreed... I really hope people don't try to victime blame this poor woman","p022","p019",3.3333,1.3333,4,2.6667
9537,368,400,4,"Person 1","Do you think people like this should be put behind bars forever","p022","p019",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9538,368,400,5,"Person 2","Totally! if you are evil enough to do it once, you'll do it again","p022","p019",4,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667

9541,368,400,8,"Person 1","I wonder if people are just born that way.","p022","p019",2,1.3333,1.3333,2
9542,368,400,9,"Person 2","They could be, or how they were raised im sure plays a big role","p022","p019",2,1.3333,1.3333,2

9548,368,400,15,"Person 2","I think rage or evilness... like they want to hurt people","p022","p019",3.3333,1.3333,3,2
9549,368,400,16,"Person 1","Yeah, let's hope people are better in the future and we evolve as humans.","p022","p019",2.6667,0,1.6667,2.3333
9550,368,400,17,"Person 2","Agreed... it's so barbaric and unhumane","p022","p019",3.6667,1.6667,4,2.3333
9551,368,400,18,"Person 1","It was nice talking to you!! bye","p022","p019",2,0.3333,1,1.6667
9552,368,400,19,"Person 2","bye","p022","p019",1,1,0.6667,1
9553,92,401,0,"Person 1","OMG, this was absolutely heartbreaking.  What did you think of it?","p029","p008",4.6667,2,4,2.6667
9554,92,401,1,"Person 2","I thought so too","p029","p008",2,1,2.3333,1.3333
9555,92,401,2,"Person 1","I mean the horror the boy must have felt, and then the horror of the family, it's just crazy","p029","p008",4.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
9556,92,401,3,"Person 2","I know! like can you imagine turning your back for a second and losing your kid forever? Horrible.","p029","p008",4.3333,2,3.6667,3
9557,92,401,4,"Person 1","I can't even imagine, it's unthinkable.  I guess the well was in the yard?  Did it say?","p029","p008",4,2,3.3333,3
9558,92,401,5,"Person 2","I think so, I know the boy was helping harvest vegetables. And the fact that they knew where he was and what happened but just couldn't reach him. So sad.","p029","p008",3.6667,2,3,2.6667
9559,92,401,6,"Person 1","Yeah, that is just terrible.  And how scared he must have been.","p029","p008",4,2,3.3333,2.6667
9560,92,401,7,"Person 2","His parents must have been so distressed too. I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him?","p029","p008",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
9561,92,401,8,"Person 1","Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detail","p029","p008",3.6667,1,2.3333,2.6667
9562,92,401,9,"Person 2","No, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground.","p029","p008",3.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
9563,92,401,10,"Person 1","Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.  Do you remember how far down it said he was?  WAs it like 400 ft?","p029","p008",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
9564,92,401,11,"Person 2","Gah, I can't remember. The only thing I remember that it was only one foot in diameter so that it was too narrow for adults.","p029","p008",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9565,92,401,12,"Person 1","That is insane.  I am claustrophobic so just the thought of that induces panic.  That poor boy.","p029","p008",4.3333,1.6667,2.6667,3
9566,92,401,13,"Person 2","It said he was three, right? or did it not mention his age? Oh my gosh I can't imagine his little face stop I'm gonna cry","p029","p008",4.6667,2,3.3333,3
9567,92,401,14,"Person 1","I do not remember seeing his age, but he must have been quite small to fit in a space that small.  Yeah no doubt, it is having the same effect on me.  I have four children and three are just babies, I am about to tear up too.  This is crazy.","p029","p008",4.6667,1.6667,4.3333,4
9568,92,401,15,"Person 2","I can almost feel the panic of the parents, like the realization of what had happened and the frantic terror. Oh my gosh, goosebumps.","p029","p008",4.6667,2,3.3333,2.6667
9569,92,401,16,"Person 1","Yeah seriously, like worst moment of their lives","p029","p008",4.3333,2,3,2.3333
9570,92,401,17,"Person 2","I don't know what else to say! this was so sad, like I just want to send a huge frowny face and I wish I could hug his mom.","p029","p008",4.3333,2,3.6667,3
9571,92,401,18,"Person 1","Yeah me too.  Probably one of the two worst articles I've read on here.  Well I hope you have a good rest of your day, it's been good talking to you.  goodbye","p029","p008",4,1.6667,3,2.6667
9572,92,401,19,"Person 2","Same here. Good luck with the rest of your day! goodbye","p029","p008",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
9573,92,402,0,"Person 1","You would think that the well on your property would be one of the first places that you looked.","p030","p010",1.3333,2,1,1.3333
9574,92,402,1,"Person 2","They did.  He fell while working with his father harvesting vegetables.  He just couldn't get him out due to how small it is.  Then they had to calculate where to stop digging.","p030","p010",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
9575,92,402,2,"Person 1","It obviously wasn't since they had 500 people searching for the boy before they started digging, but ok. How would you feel in the child's shoes? The families?","p030","p010",1.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
9576,92,402,3,"Person 2","I would be terrified if I was that little.   I just can't fathom what the little guy was thinking.   Did he scream - was he badly hurt - was he cold.  It's very disturbing to me being a parent.   I have to push those thoughts away.","p030","p010",4.6667,2,4,3
9577,92,402,4,"Person 1","Yeah, they were a little sparse with the details. Was he killed on impact? Technically, they could have easily lowered food and water to him to keep him alive until he was unearthed. Perhaps he drowned?","p030","p010",2,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
9578,92,402,5,"Person 2","I don't know.  They were very sparse with the details.   Maybe that's the point - to see how we fill in the blanks.   I remember a similar case from Texas - they did rescue him though.","p030","p010",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.6667
9579,92,402,6,"Person 1","It reminds me of that Simpson's episode.. Radio Bart I think it was, but with a much more tragic ending. Are your children similar in age to the child in the story?","p030","p010",1.3333,2,1.6667,2.6667
9580,92,402,7,"Person 2","No - mine is gone but I do have 2 small grandchildren.","p030","p010",1.6667,1,1,3.3333
9581,92,402,8,"Person 1","Ah, well what are your biggest fears for the children in your family? I'm going to assume it isn't falling down wells.","p030","p010",1.3333,1.3333,1,2
9582,92,402,9,"Person 2","Agreed.   My biggest fear is they can't play outside by themselves for fear of someone driving by and taking them.   You can't let them walk or bike to a park.   Back in the day, that never crossed your mind at all.   They are both little girls so human trafficking is a nightmare to even entertain.","p030","p010",3.6667,2,1.6667,3.6667
9583,92,402,10,"Person 1","I can't imagine. Yeah, when I was a kid we always stayed out until dusk just roaming around the neighborhood. I guess that isn't really a thing anymore.","p030","p010",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,3.3333
9584,92,402,11,"Person 2","Exactly!   Played with other kids in other yards etc.   I feel they have missed an important part of being a kid.","p030","p010",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,3
9585,92,402,12,"Person 1","Do you think that the risk in modern America of such terrible things happening has actually increased, our anxiety has been exacerbated by the inundation of horrifying news stories or it's a combination of both?","p030","p010",1.6667,1.3333,1,2
9586,92,402,13,"Person 2","I do believe the level has increased.  I also think we see it in so many mediums 24/7.  That was not the case prior to the explosive growth of technology options.   Definitely with you on how our anxiety levels are heightened when you hear about it all the time.","p030","p010",2,1.6667,1.6667,3
9587,92,402,14,"Person 1","Have you ever been a part of a search party?","p030","p010",1,1,1,1
9588,92,402,15,"Person 2","I have not - have you?","p030","p010",1,1,1,1.6667
9589,92,402,16,"Person 1","No, but once when I was visiting my great grandfather in Oklahoma my family got involved in a search for a young kid who had gone missing from his home. They found him but unfortunately he was hanging from a tree in a field. Apparently, he had had a fight with his father.","p030","p010",2,1.6667,1,3.6667
9590,92,402,17,"Person 2","Oh my!   Gave me cold chills reading that statement.   So many kids choosing to end their life.  We had one last year who jumped off a local bridge because of all the bullying on social media.   Parents have to get involved for this to stop.  Just take the account down.","p030","p010",3.3333,2,2,3.3333
9591,92,402,18,"Person 1","No kidding, that's horrible. Well, thanks for chatting with me today! Hope you have a nice afternoon. bye","p030","p010",2,1.6667,1.3333,2
9592,92,402,19,"Person 2","goodbye","p030","p010",1,1,1,1
9593,92,403,0,"Person 1","It is truly unfortunate that this kind of stuff happens on an almost daily basis. I couldn't imagine being that boy's dad.","p048","p016",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
9594,92,403,1,"Person 2","Ugh, I can't even imagine. To know your kid is just forty feet away and you... you can't get to him.","p048","p016",3.3333,2,3,2.6667
9595,92,403,2,"Person 1","Exactly. His dad probably always took him out to help him work and he'd never imagine how unfortunate he'd be that day.","p048","p016",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
9596,92,403,3,"Person 2","I mean, what are the odds? It was only a foot wide; the kid had to have fallen just so to even fit.","p048","p016",2,2,2.6667,2.3333
9597,92,403,4,"Person 1","Very true. It just makes you really think about how lucky some of us are to be alive. Freak accidents happen everyday to people who I think don't deserve it.","p048","p016",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
9598,92,403,5,"Person 2","Yeah, for sure. I hope the kid died on impact. Waiting in the dark, injured, would be awful. :(","p048","p016",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.3333
9599,92,403,6,"Person 1","Yes that's true. Especially if his dad was just a few feet away having to basically hear his child die.","p048","p016",3,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
9600,92,403,7,"Person 2","Ugh, nope, no. On the one hand at least then the kid could hear his dad's voice, but on the other... nope.","p048","p016",4,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
9601,92,403,8,"Person 1","Yeah, not ideal either way. I would not be able to live with myself if I had to endure either way. Just hopelessness I'm sure","p048","p016",3,2,3,3.3333
9602,92,403,9,"Person 2","It's humbling how we can do so much and yet be thwarted by just a too-small hole.","p048","p016",3.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
9603,92,403,10,"Person 1","It's a true wake up call for most I'm sure.","p048","p016",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
9604,92,403,11,"Person 2","Life is precious. I wonder what will happen to the well now, since i guess it's torn up.","p048","p016",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,2.3333
9605,92,403,12,"Person 1","It really is. I don't understand the people who don't see it as that. Hopefully either restored completely or torn down completely but it is China so I'm sure safety standards are slightly different","p048","p016",2.3333,2,2,2.6667
9606,92,403,13,"Person 2","Yeah. Or even in the US standards are a little different if you're in a rural area.","p048","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
9607,92,403,14,"Person 1","Yes that's very true. I can relate. I'm out in the country but born and raised in a larger city and it still surprises me the differences here.","p048","p016",2,1,1.6667,3.3333
9608,92,403,15,"Person 2","Opposite here -- born and raised country, moved towards the city. Good and bad things to both.","p048","p016",2,1,1.3333,2.6667
9609,92,403,16,"Person 1","Yes of course. I just wonder how different it is in China.","p048","p016",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
9610,92,403,17,"Person 2","Yeah. It sounds like it was a freak accident, and if they dug all around it, I don't know if it's even usable. For that matter, what would you need a well with a hole that small to start with?","p048","p016",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
9611,92,403,18,"Person 1","That's very true. It could have been an unused well that was already in bad shape.","p048","p016",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9612,92,403,19,"Person 2","Yeah, and it just kinda got grown over. I guess it was in the middle of their farm though, if they were getting vegetables?","p048","p016",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
9613,92,403,20,"Person 1","They may have not even realized it was there until it's too late. Sad to think this could happen to anyone.","p048","p016",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
9614,92,403,21,"Person 2","Indeed. Do you have any other thoughts on the article?","p048","p016",1,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
9615,92,403,22,"Person 1","No, I think we've exhausted most thoughts. goodbye","p048","p016",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
9616,92,403,23,"Person 2","bye!","p048","p016",1,0.6667,1,1.3333
9617,92,404,0,"Person 1","what did you thingk about this article","p019","p073",1,1,1,1
9618,92,404,1,"Person 2","It's horrible. I can","p019","p073",3.6667,2,3.3333,2
9619,92,404,2,"Person 1","It's super sad... I can't imagine what that little boy went through","p019","p073",4,2,3.3333,2
9620,92,404,3,"Person 2","Yeah, that's what I was going to say but I accidentally hit enter. I can't imagine what he went through and his family. It sounds horrible, but I hope for him that he died quickly and wasn't in the well scared for days.","p019","p073",4.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
9621,92,404,4,"Person 1","I hope so too, I wish the article had said...","p019","p073",3.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
9622,92,404,5,"Person 2","Me too, but I am kind of grateful the article didn't give a lot of details. It's just terrifying.","p019","p073",4,2,2.3333,2
9623,92,404,6,"Person 1","It is... I feel bad for the workers too... It must have been devastating to find","p019","p073",4,1.6667,3.6667,2
9624,92,404,7,"Person 2","I wonder if his dad knew that the well was there. He probably feels so guilty either way since the boy was helping him when it happened.","p019","p073",4,1.6667,2.6667,2
9625,92,404,8,"Person 1","I wondered that too... And yes that would be so so hard to live with","p019","p073",3.6667,2,3,2.3333
9626,92,404,9,"Person 2","I don't think it said how old the boy was either. I thought it just said young.","p019","p073",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2
9627,92,404,10,"Person 1","I think so too...","p019","p073",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
9628,92,404,11,"Person 2","Really, I'm having a hard time discussing this story because it's just too hard to think about. It is just so sad. I can't imagine if this happened to one of my children.","p019","p073",4.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
9629,92,404,12,"Person 1","Honestly same here.... I could never stop thinking about the what ifs... Or how long he lived for down there.","p019","p073",4,2,2.3333,2
9630,92,404,13,"Person 2","I know, it's heart wrenching.","p019","p073",4.3333,2,3,2
9631,92,404,14,"Person 1","I'm glad thought that the workers did all they could... it's good they tried","p019","p073",3.6667,0,2.3333,1.6667
9632,92,404,15,"Person 2","That's true, I'm sure they probably worked night and day.","p019","p073",2.6667,0,2,1.6667
9633,92,404,16,"Person 1","Which I'm sure made it harder to find that boy. the way he was... but easier to live with knowing they did all they could","p019","p073",4,1.3333,2,2
9634,92,404,17,"Person 2","Hopefully they can have peace with it. I'm sure they did all they could.","p019","p073",3.6667,0,2,2
9635,92,404,18,"Person 1","me too","p019","p073",2.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
9636,92,404,19,"Person 2","It's been good talking to you and thanks for trying to find some positive in the situation!","p019","p073",3,0.3333,1.3333,2
9637,92,404,20,"Person 1","you as well! bye","p019","p073",2,1,1.3333,1.3333
9638,92,404,21,"Person 2","bye","p019","p073",1,1,1,1
9639,92,405,0,"Person 1","Wow, what did you think of this?","p029","p022",2,1,1,1
9640,92,405,1,"Person 2","I felt so sad! What about you my friend?","p029","p022",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.3333
9641,92,405,2,"Person 1","Me too, it was genuinely heartbreaking.  Can you imagine?","p029","p022",4,1.6667,3.6667,2
9642,92,405,3,"Person 2","I can't even imagine if i was the parent of the child. I would be in depressio nforever","p029","p022",4,1.6667,3.3333,2.6667
9643,92,405,4,"Person 1","Me too, I could never recover.  It must have been so scary too for the boy.","p029","p022",4,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
9644,92,405,5,"Person 2","Yeah i think it said that he fell in while helping his family harvest vegetables. So sad..","p029","p022",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
9645,92,405,6,"Person 1","Yeah just doing an everyday mundane task.  Four days is a long time, too!!","p029","p022",3,1.3333,3,2
9646,92,405,7,"Person 2","Exactly! But accidents happen, what can you do","p029","p022",1.6667,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9647,92,405,8,"Person 1","Yes that is a sad fact of life","p029","p022",2,1.6667,2,1.6667
9648,92,405,9,"Person 2","Have you ever gotten into any life threatening dangers?","p029","p022",1.3333,1,1,1.3333

9650,92,405,11,"Person 2","I would say one time i accidentally burned myself on the stove, that's about it","p029","p022",0.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667

9652,92,405,13,"Person 2","That's good. I own a dog and if something were to happen to him, i would be devastated... let alone my own child!","p029","p022",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,3
9653,92,405,14,"Person 1","oh yeah, I have four children and one more on the way, it's my biggest fear in life.  I cant even talk about it.  what kind of dog do you have","p029","p022",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,4
9654,92,405,15,"Person 2","I have a sharpei, i love him to death. Now i understand why my parents use to nag me for being out too late as a teenager!","p029","p022",2.3333,0.3333,2.3333,3.6667

9661,331,406,1,"Person 2","I'm surprised that the gap is not close to closing. How about you?","p019","p035",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9662,331,406,2,"Person 1","me too, i was surprised that it is growing, as that is not what i see in field","p019","p035",2,2,1.3333,1.6667
9663,331,406,3,"Person 2","Yeah, to me it's simple equal pay for equal work.","p019","p035",1.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9664,331,406,4,"Person 1","Yup... I don't get why it can't be implented or why there cant' be some sort of check in place","p019","p035",1.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
9665,331,406,5,"Person 2","That should be a simple law to pass","p019","p035",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1
9666,331,406,6,"Person 1","You'd think... I also think it's sad that a country as advanced as the US can't figure it out. It should be a priority. We are 51% of the country afterall","p019","p035",1.6667,1.6667,2,2
9667,331,406,7,"Person 2","I think we think we are advanced but we are behind the times on a lot of things.","p019","p035",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
9668,331,406,8,"Person 1","Agreed, especially in this area. IMO it's because there are so many more men running the country than women. It is just not as important to them","p019","p035",1.6667,2,1.6667,2
9669,331,406,9,"Person 2","Agreed. I do think some jobs by their nature will have more men than women working them. Like firefighters, If a woman can pass the physical part of the job then she should have it.","p019","p035",2,0,2.6667,2.3333
9670,331,406,10,"Person 1","Yes that is true, there are physcial limitations that are harder for women to achieve in some jobs. BUt they should still have an opportunity at them","p019","p035",1.6667,0,2.3333,2
9671,331,406,11,"Person 2","I agree with that.","p019","p035",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.3333
9672,331,406,12,"Person 1","I also think it's sad women aren't advancing in their careers as much as men. All the women i know in power positions work just as hard or harder than their male counterparts","p019","p035",2,1,2.6667,2.6667
9673,331,406,13,"Person 2","I agree, but this system was not built was everybody in mind so its going to take a while to change it.","p019","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1.6667
9674,331,406,14,"Person 1","Yes... probably longer than everyone would like. It makes me sad as a women in the workforce, trying to advance. ANd I am in Electrical so it's a very male driven workforce","p019","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,3
9675,331,406,15,"Person 2","As a man, I'm glad that you are doing what makes you happy and as a father of three girls I'm happy to see women push into uncharted territory","p019","p035",2.3333,0.3333,2,3.3333

9680,331,406,20,"Person 1","haha it is kind of scary at first! But once you get shocked a time or too i think your body realizes it's not that bad. Luckily right now I do residential so there isn't a ton of high voltage","p019","p035",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,3
9681,331,406,21,"Person 2","Good lucky with your career and it was very nice chatting with you! bye.","p019","p035",2.3333,0,1.3333,1.6667

9683,331,407,0,"Person 1","hey what were your takeaways with this article?","p068","p073",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
9684,331,407,1,"Person 2","I have a hard time with pay comparisons by gender. I'm not denying that women on average probably make less, I'm just not sure it's a fair comparison.","p068","p073",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.6667
9685,331,407,2,"Person 1","Yeah I have a mixedreaction it is sad less are in the work system as a whole","p068","p073",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
9686,331,407,3,"Person 2","It's not necessarily sad. My husband and I chose for me to be a stay at home mom and for him to work. That is what works for our family. I think we are lucky to be able to have one of us stay home.","p068","p073",2.3333,1,1.6667,3
9687,331,407,4,"Person 1","I guess, if that works happy there are thing like the stem program","p068","p073",2,0.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9688,331,407,5,"Person 2","I really don't get what they say about that either, because while I was working, I had a job in science in genetics. At my work and at most of the other universities that we worked with, it seemed to be at least 50/50 men to women and I actually think more women.","p068","p073",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,3
9689,331,407,6,"Person 1","I don't now I don't have much experience with it but I know in college there were alot less females vs males in my science and math classes","p068","p073",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
9690,331,407,7,"Person 2","I think possibly there are more men who are engineers, but I think it's just not a career choice that many women make. If a women does get an engineering degree, she will probably have an easy time getting a job because there are so few women engineers and companies are always trying to add diversity.","p068","p073",2,0,1.6667,2.3333
9691,331,407,8,"Person 1","that is a great way to consider it maybe in the next generation there will be more and the next complaint is to many women in the field","p068","p073",2,1,1,2
9692,331,407,9,"Person 2","I just feel like sometimes men and women don't have to have equal representation in jobs. If a woman or a man wants to do a job that is traditionally only done by the other sex, I think they have every right to pursue that and shouldn't be discriminated against. But there are some jobs that most women or most men wouldn't be interested in. Like, I've never seen a female trash person. Most women just wouldn't be interested in that job.","p068","p073",3.3333,0.6667,2,2.6667
9693,331,407,10,"Person 1","yeah very true the interest is usually why back when they were created it was divided im sure not much is stopping them from getting into a non traditional role","p068","p073",2.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2
9694,331,407,11,"Person 2","I'm sure worldwide, that there are places where women are discriminated against horribly. I can't imagine living in a place like that.","p068","p073",2.6667,1.3333,2,2
9695,331,407,12,"Person 1","true i know places like china and syria they are seen as less than","p068","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9696,331,407,13,"Person 2","I felt like the article was trying to say how bad the US is though that they have moved down in gender pay equality. I feel like if people really looked at how other cultures are, they would appreciate how good we really have it in the US.","p068","p073",2.3333,0,1,2.3333
9697,331,407,14,"Person 1","true but im sure thats why the list is created places like africa look at ways we are above them and then us how places lie europe are above us to find ways to improve","p068","p073",2,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
9698,331,407,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I guess it gives every country something to strive for.","p068","p073",1.3333,0.3333,1,1.6667
9699,331,407,16,"Person 1","yeah hopefully more improvements to come for future generations","p068","p073",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9700,331,407,17,"Person 2","Yes, definitely. It's been good chatting with you.","p068","p073",1.6667,0.3333,1,1.3333
9701,331,407,18,"Person 1","you two bye!","p068","p073",1.6667,0.6667,1,1.3333
9702,331,407,19,"Person 2","bye","p068","p073",1,1,1,1
9703,331,408,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about gender equality in the U.S.?","p030","p010",0.6667,1,1,1
9704,331,408,1,"Person 2","I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you?","p030","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,3.3333
9705,331,408,2,"Person 1","I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.","p030","p010",3,1.3333,3,3.3333
9706,331,408,3,"Person 2","It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?","p030","p010",3.3333,1.3333,3,4
9707,331,408,4,"Person 1","Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.","p030","p010",2.3333,1.6667,2,2.3333
9708,331,408,5,"Person 2","Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating.","p030","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2
9709,331,408,6,"Person 1","Also, it's partly being locked into the \"just world\" fallacy. Lots of people believe that people are paid more simply because they work harder or are more effective.","p030","p010",2,2,1.6667,2
9710,331,408,7,"Person 2","Wow you hit the nail on the head.    Was your mom paid fairly or given the opportunity to advance - gender set aside?","p030","p010",2,0.6667,1.6667,2
9711,331,408,8,"Person 1","No, she worked for the state and was offered \"promotions\" but her pay grade was the same and the workload was heavier. She now works for a non-profit and is the music leader at her church which she gets paid for. She seems much happier.","p030","p010",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3.3333
9712,331,408,9,"Person 2","Oh I am so happy for her!    You raised two great children and now doing something she loves.  US being so low on the pay inequality is astounding.  We are \"suppose\" to be the best.","p030","p010",2.6667,0,2.3333,2
9713,331,408,10,"Person 1","Thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're supposed to be a bastion of freedom and equality but most of western Europe and some of the more progressive Asian nations have been outpacing us with regard to gender equality for some time.","p030","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2,2
9714,331,408,11,"Person 2","Exactly and the same with education - Our society is based on me, me, me.  It","p030","p010",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
9715,331,408,12,"Person 1","It's true, our public education system has become a national embarrassment in most places. I haven't been inside one in years and frankly i'm afraid of what they look like on the inside these days.","p030","p010",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
9716,331,408,13,"Person 2","I apologize for hitting the return key too quickly.   My daughter ended up changing my granddaughters to Montessori.   There kids actually learn, experience, have one on one help and concentrate not only on studies but encouraging them to be great human beings.  Public schools now are full of bullies and teaching to a test.","p030","p010",2.6667,0.3333,2,3.6667
9717,331,408,14,"Person 1","They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a \"gifted\" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools.","p030","p010",2,1.3333,1.6667,3
9718,331,408,15,"Person 2","It does.  My daughter was in gifted.  We called it the \"little yellow schoolhouse\" because it was a building separate from the school.   What an experience and jumpstart both of you had in pursuing goals and futures.","p030","p010",2.3333,0,2,3.3333
9719,331,408,16,"Person 1","It was an enriching experience to be sure, but having everything come so easily early on made learning healthy study skills and habits a trial to learn once I started college. I was glad to read that the U.S. is improving with regard to educational equality..","p030","p010",3,0.3333,1.3333,3
9720,331,408,17,"Person 2","Me too.   I am proud of this country and like to see us at least be in the top 10.    Are there other pay equality issues you want to comment on?","p030","p010",2.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
9721,331,408,18,"Person 1","Just that news like this will inspire people to speak up and act on their own pride and in their own best interest. Thanks so much for chatting today! bye","p030","p010",2.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667
9722,331,408,19,"Person 2","goodbye","p030","p010",1,1,1,1
9723,331,409,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this read","p019","p030",0.6667,1,0.6667,1
9724,331,409,1,"Person 2","I guess I think that restructuring society in a more egalitarian fashion is going to take a lot longer than it should.","p019","p030",1.3333,2,1.3333,2
9725,331,409,2,"Person 1","Agreed... there's no real rhyme or reason this is still such an issue","p019","p030",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2
9726,331,409,3,"Person 2","I equate it to self help for an entire species. People just can't be bothered to do anything about it until it gets out of hand.","p019","p030",2,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
9727,331,409,4,"Person 1","That is a good viewpoint... I also feel like the disadvantage of it only being half the species dealing with the gap plays a role","p019","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2
9728,331,409,5,"Person 2","That's a very good point actually. Most men are content to sit on their hands on this particular issue.","p019","p030",2.3333,1,1.3333,2.6667
9729,331,409,6,"Person 1","for sure! And fixing the gap could result in lower pay for them, so why would they want to help fix it","p019","p030",2.6667,1,1.6667,2.3333
9730,331,409,7,"Person 2","I honestly don't think it would result in lower pay. That's one of the scare tactics used by anti-feminists to scare men into their belief system. The same is used as a foil for affirmative action and other progressive initiatives.","p019","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,3
9731,331,409,8,"Person 1","That's interesting to hear... makes sense though","p019","p030",2,1,1.3333,1.6667
9732,331,409,9,"Person 2","It's just that diversity in the workforce actually creates more opportunities in the long run for all concerned instead of filling up a limited number of spaces. What do you think should be done to stimulate the closing of the gender gap?","p019","p030",1.6667,1,2,2.3333
9733,331,409,10,"Person 1","I think that head people should be making it known that they are actively working on it, and actually do so","p019","p030",2,1,2,2
9734,331,409,11,"Person 2","Simple enough. Do you think it is in the hands of businesses and corporations to spearhead the change, or does the responsibility lie with the public, or both?","p019","p030",1.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
9735,331,409,12,"Person 1","I think both, but mainly with businesses and such","p019","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9736,331,409,13,"Person 2","I think they definitely have the greatest capacity to incite social change, but also the biggest incentive to maintain the status quo.","p019","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
9737,331,409,14,"Person 1","Agreed... There'd almost have to be some sort of incentive","p019","p030",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
9738,331,409,15,"Person 2","Like a carbon tax, but for gender inequality.","p019","p030",1.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9739,331,409,16,"Person 1","yah exatly","p019","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
9740,331,409,17,"Person 2","Do you think it's a realistic goal? Or, do you think it's overly idealistic to attempt to overthrow centuries of social norms and inequality?","p019","p030",1,1,1,1.3333
9741,331,409,18,"Person 1","I think it is a very big goal, that we would have to go about slowly... unfortunately","p019","p030",2,2,1.6667,2
9742,331,409,19,"Person 2","I agree. Thanks for chatting with me today! bye","p019","p030",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667

9822,112,413,4,"Person 1","We've literally turned the ocean into the worlds largest dump.

9826,112,413,8,"Person 1","I think it should absolutely be required that fail safes be in place before they begin drilling. I mean, it's not like these oil drilling outfits are strapped for cash or anything.","p030","p064",1.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333

9828,112,413,10,"Person 1","We can't move away from oil and gas soon enough. We're going to continue drawing it up until it's completely gone, but it would be nice to get to a place where we don't need it anymore to function.","p030","p064",1.3333,2,1.3333,2
9829,112,413,11,"Person 2","Yes that would be nice, I worry about what the world will be like for my childrens, children if we don't become more green and start taking better care of the planet","p030","p064",2,0,3,2

9833,112,413,15,"Person 2","Yea and I don't think we can prevent some areas from going underwater at this point","p030","p064",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2

9869,112,415,10,"Person 1","Wow! This is a fact i didn't know. Would you accept a tax or fine for people that litter and dont recycle?","p031","p022",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
9870,112,415,11,"Person 2","I would do it for littering","p031","p022",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667

9872,112,415,13,"Person 2","all but China-the trash can and the worst offender! They poison everything around. Not to mention the mercury in the ocean and radiation from Japan that reached the coast of California","p031","p022",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333

9875,112,415,16,"Person 1","Hmm what do you think Americans can do to help then","p031","p022",2,1,1,1.6667
9876,112,415,17,"Person 2","pretty much nothing-that's their culture and way of life, they are poor and uneducated, we cannot help everybody, look where it got us-our economy and everything in the toilet, we cannot be the savior and have to focus on our own needs","p031","p022",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667

9881,301,416,0,"Person 1","pretty sad what's happening to the kids","p039","p029",2.6667,2,2.3333,2
9882,301,416,1,"Person 2","It's outrageous.  There is really no excuse, if people feel the need to have these drugs around they need to keep them locked up or really high in a cabinet away from children, same as you would treat a loaded gun","p039","p029",4.3333,1.6667,3.3333,3
9883,301,416,2,"Person 1","exactly and the heroin overdoses is just crazy","p039","p029",3.3333,1,2.6667,2
9884,301,416,3,"Person 2","It's crazy.  There was some woman in the news a few days ago who was giving heroin to her one year old every night to help her sleep.  It killed the baby.","p039","p029",4.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
9885,301,416,4,"Person 1","really? wow the things people do nowadays","p039","p029",3,1.3333,2,1.6667
9886,301,416,5,"Person 2","What is WRONG with people?!?  I have four kids, three are babies, and it is incomprehensible to me that someone would even consider doing something like that!!!!  Sure they wake up at night, sometimes multiple times, but that's part of having a child.","p039","p029",4.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
9887,301,416,6,"Person 1","I have 4 kids too and that is exactly how I feel I can't believe the stories I hear","p039","p029",4,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
9888,301,416,7,"Person 2","Yeah this woman was rubbing heroin on the baby's gums each night.  Well she got a batch laced with fentanyl.","p039","p029",3,1.6667,2.6667,2
9889,301,416,8,"Person 1","people like her need to be sterilized","p039","p029",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
9890,301,416,9,"Person 2","They do.  It's shocking.  And so unfair to the kids","p039","p029",4.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2
9891,301,416,10,"Person 1","I think we should start giving hysterectomies and vasectomies to these folks","p039","p029",4,1.6667,2,2.3333
9892,301,416,11,"Person 2","If they do something like that, then yeah.  Because all it would do is put more kids lives in danger if they have more","p039","p029",3.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
9893,301,416,12,"Person 1","the ghettos of america are full of children that are neglected and abused","p039","p029",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
9894,301,416,13,"Person 2","they are. it is so sickening to me.  some guy in the news killed his several month old baby by throwing him on the ground bc he was mad he lost a video game","p039","p029",4.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
9895,301,416,14,"Person 1","did you see the video of the guy in NYC who jumped in front of a train while holding his 5 year old daughter","p039","p029",3.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
9896,301,416,15,"Person 2","No, but that is the same thing!  like, what the heck!?  and meanwhile there are couples out there just desperate to have a baby who would give these children a loving home.  It's so twisted and messed up and sad.","p039","p029",5,1.6667,2.6667,2
9897,301,416,16,"Person 1","I think God if there is one has abandoned us","p039","p029",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
9898,301,416,17,"Person 2","I think God and other good powers are still there, but there's evil that's out there too.  It's always been there, just manifesting in different ways.  There is still a lot of good in the world, too, gotta remember that","p039","p029",4.3333,1.3333,2,2.3333
9899,301,416,18,"Person 1","yea that is true its not all doom and gloom","p039","p029",3.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9900,301,416,19,"Person 2","yeah but I totally get what you are saying, sometimes it really seems that way, especially when you look at some of the awful things people do.  well I must go but I hope you have a really good day full of positive happy things :)  goodbye","p039","p029",3.6667,0.6667,2,2
9901,301,416,20,"Person 1","goodbye","p039","p029",1.3333,1,1,1
9902,301,417,0,"Person 1","Hello, what did you think about the article?","p022","p016",1,1,0.6667,1
9903,301,417,1,"Person 2","I thought it was sad. :( I've heard plenty about the opioid crisis, but not in relation to kids before.","p022","p016",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
9904,301,417,2,"Person 1","Yeah seriously! The parents need to be more responsible","p022","p016",3,1.6667,1.6667,1
9905,301,417,3,"Person 2","Yeah, though it's hard to fault them. Children are naturally curious and it only takes you forgetting one time to lead to disaster.","p022","p016",3,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
9906,301,417,4,"Person 1","It's so sad because these children had their whole lives ahead of them!","p022","p016",3.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
9907,301,417,5,"Person 2","It's especially sad because they would have had no concept that what they're doing would be a problem. They probably just thought it was candy or something.","p022","p016",3.3333,1.6667,4,1.3333
9908,301,417,6,"Person 1","Exactly. I'm not sure if you can even prevent this","p022","p016",2.3333,0.6667,2,1
9909,301,417,7,"Person 2","Yeah. It mentioned that the kids are figuring out how to open the bottles — maybe better child proofing should be looked in to?","p022","p016",2,0.3333,1.3333,1
9910,301,417,8,"Person 1","That's a great idea. Do you have children of your own?","p022","p016",2,0.6667,1.3333,1
9911,301,417,9,"Person 2","Not personally, no, but I used to nanny for several different families so I'm well aware of the trouble they can get themselves into, haha. You?","p022","p016",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3
9912,301,417,10,"Person 1","I don't but i can't even imagine the horror the parents must have felt when they arrived home and saw what happpened with their child","p022","p016",3.6667,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
9913,301,417,11,"Person 2","Yeah. :( All it takes is a split second of inattention — and no one can pay attention /all/ the time — and bam. :(","p022","p016",3,2,2,1
9914,301,417,12,"Person 1","Yeah! I hope the families that went through this are okay now though","p022","p016",2.6667,1,3,1.3333
9915,301,417,13,"Person 2","Indeed. Going back to the problem, I also think it would help if opioids just weren't prescribed as much as they are. Kids can't get ahold of them if the parents don't have them, after all.","p022","p016",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
9916,301,417,14,"Person 1","That's true. I have a dog and i get terrified when i eat chocolate because i don't want to drop any","p022","p016",2.6667,1,2,2.3333
9917,301,417,15,"Person 2","Yeah. The statistics in America for opioid overdose are horrible and they've been climbing every year. From what I understand the biggest issue is in doctors just over prescribing and then people get addicted largely by accident.","p022","p016",3,1,2,1
9918,301,417,16,"Person 1","I wonder if Opioids are even needed, or if there is some alternate solution to prescribe to people that is more safe","p022","p016",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1
9919,301,417,17,"Person 2","It's hard to say. I expect the solution is less writing it off entirely and just being more judicious when they're handed out. Like how antibiotics are prescribed too liberally and we're creating monster viruses that are immune.","p022","p016",1.6667,1,2,1.3333
9920,301,417,18,"Person 1","I can agree with that. Let's hope this crisis is dealt with and we have less dying children. It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p016",3,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
9921,301,417,19,"Person 2","bye!","p022","p016",1.3333,1,1,1
9922,301,418,0,"Person 1","This is just sad, and I think part of a much larger problem of opioid addiction.","p073","p068",3,2,2.6667,2.6667
9923,301,418,1,"Person 2","me two prescribed way to often without any follow up","p073","p068",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
9924,301,418,2,"Person 1","Yeah, the kids are probably getting it more because it is around so much more than it used to be.","p073","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
9925,301,418,3,"Person 2","exactly and its crazy they are figuring out how to get into childproof caps","p073","p068",2.6667,2,2,2
9926,301,418,4,"Person 1","My kids could figure those out when they were pretty young.","p073","p068",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
9927,301,418,5,"Person 2","oh man well maybe they can develop a locking system with a code","p073","p068",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
9928,301,418,6,"Person 1","That's a great idea! Like on a padlock.","p073","p068",2.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9929,301,418,7,"Person 2","yes! similar cap just have to put in numbers seems to be cheap","p073","p068",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9930,301,418,8,"Person 1","Or like a combination - turn cap right to 21, then left to 12.... l","p073","p068",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9931,301,418,9,"Person 2","Yes! that's hard for even adults to break could be a great new tool","p073","p068",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2
9932,301,418,10,"Person 1","I wonder if the kids who overdose have any increased susceptibility to addition in the future.","p073","p068",2,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
9933,301,418,11,"Person 2","I think I read once you take a substance it turns something on in your brain that will never shutoff wanting more pretty scary","p073","p068",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
9934,301,418,12,"Person 1","That","p073","p068",1,1,0.6667,1
9935,301,418,13,"Person 2","i think you cut off but yes pretty scary for adults let alone innocent children there minds are so suseptible","p073","p068",3,2,3,2.3333
9936,301,418,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I accidentally hit enter. I was just going to say that is what I thought I had heard also. I guess people with children could also be more careful with their prescriptions, like not letting pills lay around or maybe keep them in a safe.","p073","p068",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
9937,301,418,15,"Person 2","yeah only take them in one place and thoroughly check one hasnt fallen before leaving","p073","p068",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9938,301,418,16,"Person 1","It seems so simple, but apparently it is not what is happening.","p073","p068",2,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9939,301,418,17,"Person 2","true maybe there in so much pain and have no help things just get lost in translation until its to late, maybe telling the kids pills are bad and to gve them to mom or dad if founf would be good","p073","p068",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
9940,301,418,18,"Person 1","It seems crazy to me that the kids would actually ingest the pills, I would think as soon as they tasted it, it would taste so bad that they would spit it out. I guess it happens though.","p073","p068",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
9941,301,418,19,"Person 2","true i feel bad because it must scare them so much the effects after","p073","p068",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
9942,301,418,20,"Person 1","Yeah, hopefully though they do feel bad and it doesn't happen more than once to the same child.","p073","p068",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
9943,301,418,21,"Person 2","agreed! it has been a great chat! bye","p073","p068",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9944,301,418,22,"Person 1","Yeah, nice talking to you! bye","p073","p068",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
9945,301,419,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article","p022","p024",1,1,0.6667,1
9946,301,419,1,"Person 2","I think some people just shouldn't be parents, what about you?","p022","p024",2.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
9947,301,419,2,"Person 1","I agree. It's terrible and sad.","p022","p024",3,2,3,2.3333
9948,301,419,3,"Person 2","imagine leaving pills on the floor while being a parent with kids in the house","p022","p024",2.6667,2,2,2
9949,301,419,4,"Person 1","Exactly! i don't think i would ever forgive myself if i killed my own child.","p022","p024",4,2,2.3333,3
9950,301,419,5,"Person 2","even just drugging my own child I would never forgive myself!","p022","p024",4,2,2.3333,3
9951,301,419,6,"Person 1","Do you think people like this should not be allowed to have children forever?","p022","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.3333
9952,301,419,7,"Person 2","I think so, what do you think?","p022","p024",2,1.3333,2,2
9953,301,419,8,"Person 1","I think so as well! I feel like it's hard for people to change.","p022","p024",3,2,2,2.3333
9954,301,419,9,"Person 2","yeah cps needs to do a better job out there","p022","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
9955,301,419,10,"Person 1","I agree. Childrens lives are in danger because of so many careless adults","p022","p024",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
9956,301,419,11,"Person 2","yeah it starts at home with parents and when parents arent any good who else is there to save them","p022","p024",3,1.3333,2,2.6667
9957,301,419,12,"Person 1","That's true. Even though what the parents did was terrible, it was not on purpose and i hope they have a somewhat decent life moving forward","p022","p024",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
9958,301,419,13,"Person 2","yeah it was an accident only","p022","p024",2,1,2,1.6667

9960,301,419,15,"Person 2","if i was the parent here i would probably be tracing back my steps to see where i dropped the pill and make sure it never happens again. you?","p022","p024",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
9961,301,419,16,"Person 1","I would most likely do the same. I would probably be in depression for many years as well","p022","p024",3.6667,2,3.3333,3
9962,301,419,17,"Person 2","yeah i would always have it on the back of my mind","p022","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,3

9966,301,420,1,"Person 2","Crazy this is happening more today then back when","p029","p068",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333
9967,301,420,2,"Person 1","I think it's ridiculous.  As a mother of four, three of whom are under age four, I think it's inexcusable people can't f ind a way to keep their drugs pout of reach","p029","p068",4,2,2.3333,3.6667
9968,301,420,3,"Person 2","I agree but who knows what is going on in there life","p029","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.3333
9969,301,420,4,"Person 1","yeah but it's still no excuse.  it feels like I read about a baby overdosing almost every week, and the majority of the time the parent is abusing the drugs","p029","p068",3.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
9970,301,420,5,"Person 2","Yeah I can see that just being neglectful","p029","p068",2.3333,1.3333,2,1
9971,301,420,6,"Person 1","highly neglectful","p029","p068",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1
9972,301,420,7,"Person 2","maybe the drug companys should make it so you have to put in a code to get into them","p029","p068",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
9973,301,420,8,"Person 1","yeah that could work.  I mean it should be up to the consumer really, b ut if people are going to be so irresponsible then I guess the drug companies doing something is better than nothing.  At least it would protect the poor babies.","p029","p068",3,1.3333,2.6667,1.3333
9974,301,420,9,"Person 2","yeah I agree and maybe doctors can educate people more on how easily kids can get into and die from them","p029","p068",2.3333,1,2,1
9975,301,420,10,"Person 1","yeah seriously but the kind of people who are abusing a bunch of opioids and benzos probably aren't paying attention to that anyway or would forget to do it.","p029","p068",3.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
9976,301,420,11,"Person 2","yeah but im sure some of these people are just over worked tired parents who forget or dont know","p029","p068",2.6667,1.3333,2.6667,1
9977,301,420,12,"Person 1","maybe there are some, but I don't know.  Every case I've read has been a drug user, I\"ve never even seen one where it was a legitimate prescription.  I'm sure they exist though.  But being over worked or tired is still no excuse.  I'm constantly overworked and tired and would never forget to secure something that could harm my child.  good grief.","p029","p068",4,1.6667,1.3333,3.6667
9978,301,420,13,"Person 2","I think doctors need to prescribe less crazy drugs then these or something","p029","p068",2.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
9979,301,420,14,"Person 1","yeah no doubt!  and people need to get a grip on their own behavior.  stop abusing drugs if you're going to be a parent.","p029","p068",3.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
9980,301,420,15,"Person 2","yeah my mom got addicted and abandoned all five of us ill never understand","p029","p068",3.6667,1.6667,1.6667,4

9982,301,420,17,"Person 2","thank you its been very hard especially because its usually the dad who leaves have not found many with the same story but reading articles like this im glad it didnt happen near me","p029","p068",3.6667,1,2.3333,3
9983,301,420,18,"Person 1","Yeah really, it's not usually a mother who leaves her children.  His mom tries to come around now and he won't even acknowledge her, she's still messed up.  Well it's been good talking to you, I hope you have a nice afternoon and take care.  bye!","p029","p068",3.3333,1,2,3

10004,133,421,19,"Person 2","yeah no one does anything until it's too late","p039","p029",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.3333
10005,133,421,20,"Person 1","exactly and then we all cry about it","p039","p029",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.3333

10008,133,422,0,"Person 1","Hello what did you think about the article","p022","p062",1,1,0.6667,1
10009,133,422,1,"Person 2","I thought it was sad.  I've never understood pointless cruelty or destruction like this.","p022","p062",3,2,2,2.3333
10010,133,422,2,"Person 1","Poor flamingo was just minding it 's own business and got attacked!","p022","p062",3,2,3.3333,1.6667
10011,133,422,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I can't even imagine what was going through the guy's head.  Although I've read that people hurting animals at the zoo isn't all that uncommon.","p022","p062",2.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
10012,133,422,4,"Person 1","That's terrible! I've never heard that. I wonder what kind of consequences this man is going to face","p022","p062",3,2,2.6667,1.6667
10013,133,422,5,"Person 2","Hopefully pretty severe.  But yeah, I have no idea what \"animal cruelty\" charges bring.","p022","p062",2.6667,2,2,2
10014,133,422,6,"Person 1","I would say at least a couple years in jail! The fact that you can just go up to an animal and slam it to the ground sounds.. disturbing","p022","p062",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
10015,133,422,7,"Person 2","For sure.  I also wonder how/why they thought they'd get away with it.  There must have been a lot of people around.","p022","p062",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
10016,133,422,8,"Person 1","Yeah! Exactly. It's sad how not only are we destroying the homes of animals but now we're abusing them as well","p022","p062",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
10017,133,422,9,"Person 2","Yes, whether it's as a species or as individuals, we tend to be pretty destructive, even sadistic at times.","p022","p062",3,2,1.6667,2
10018,133,422,10,"Person 1","I don't think it's ever going to change sadly.","p022","p062",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333
10019,133,422,11,"Person 2","I tend to agree.  I think it's part of our makeup.  We'll always keep striving for dominance and control, over each other and nature.","p022","p062",3,2,1.6667,2.6667
10020,133,422,12,"Person 1","True. I saw a video of people abusing elephants and it made me want to cry","p022","p062",4,2,2.6667,2.3333
10021,133,422,13,"Person 2","Yeah, that's terrible.  Again, I just don't understand it.  Does it make people feel powerful or tough or something?  Or maybe they're just sadists.","p022","p062",3.6667,2,2,2.3333
10022,133,422,14,"Person 1","I think sadists or just the fact that they think animals are just a .. thing, with no emotions","p022","p062",3,2,1.6667,2.3333
10023,133,422,15,"Person 2","For sure.  I'm sure that's part of it.  I bet the zookeepers at the Busch Gardens are absolutely distraught.  I'm sure they develop close bonds with all those animals.","p022","p062",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
10024,133,422,16,"Person 1","Definitely. I live in Florida too so Busch Gardens is only a 2 hour drive from me. Very sad","p022","p062",3,2,2.3333,3.3333
10025,133,422,17,"Person 2","My grandparents used to live in Florida.  Never went to a Busch Gardens but we went to alligator farms and stuff like that.  Always loved seeing animals.  Hopefully they were all treated well.","p022","p062",2.6667,0.3333,2.3333,3.3333
10026,133,422,18,"Person 1","Let's hope things improve in the future for both humans and animals. It was nice talking to you! bye","p022","p062",2,0,2,1.3333
10027,133,422,19,"Person 2","Yes, it was nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye","p022","p062",2,0,1,1
10028,133,423,0,"Person 1","What did you think of the article?","p016","p019",1,1,0.6667,1
10029,133,423,1,"Person 2","I think it's sad... I don't get why people do stuff like that","p016","p019",2.6667,2,2,2.3333
10030,133,423,2,"Person 1","It just seems so senseless; I can't imagine why someone would do it.","p016","p019",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
10031,133,423,3,"Person 2","Me neither... Do you think his punishment was fair/","p016","p019",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2
10032,133,423,4,"Person 1","I honestly don't have much of a frame of reference, but $2K for an animal's life seems fair.","p016","p019",1.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
10033,133,423,5,"Person 2","I would agree for the most part... I think therapy or something else should be required too, because that is not the actions of an OK person","p016","p019",2.6667,1.6667,1,3
10034,133,423,6,"Person 1","Yeah, agreed. And some kind of training/learning about animals.","p016","p019",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
10035,133,423,7,"Person 2","Yes that's a good idea too.","p016","p019",1.6667,0.3333,1,2
10036,133,423,8,"Person 1","I was surprised that the flamingo was 19. I wonder how old they can be?","p016","p019",2,1,1.3333,1
10037,133,423,9,"Person 2","I have no idea, but I would assume that's an older flamingo, probably getting up there in age.","p016","p019",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
10038,133,423,10,"Person 1","Yeah. Poor guy. :( I wonder what the rest of his flock is like.","p016","p019",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
10039,133,423,11,"Person 2","Aw they probably will miss him I did not think about that.","p016","p019",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
10040,133,423,12,"Person 1","I know elephants mourn their dead for a long time. I wonder if flamingos are the same. :(","p016","p019",3,2,2,2.3333
10041,133,423,13,"Person 2","I'm sure most animals can mourn in some sense.... That's sad. I also worry for the people around this guy. Because if he thinks that is ok to do in public, what does he think is ok to do behind closed doors?","p016","p019",3,2,2.3333,2.6667
10042,133,423,14,"Person 1","Yeah, no kidding. It said he was with his family — I'd be worried for their safety, honestly. He's clearly capable of random acts of violence.","p016","p019",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,3
10043,133,423,15,"Person 2","Me too.... I'm sure for him to do that in public, he has done something like that before in private","p016","p019",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
10044,133,423,16,"Person 1","Yeah. It's creepy that he'd already picked up a different flamingo. I wonder what was going through his head??","p016","p019",3,2,2,2
10045,133,423,17,"Person 2","I wonder if there's some mental illness going on","p016","p019",2.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
10046,133,423,18,"Person 1","Hard to say. I know that most people with mental illnesses are more likely to be abused than cause abuse, so idk if I'd want to stereotype, but. Yipes.","p016","p019",3,1.6667,2,2.3333
10047,133,423,19,"Person 2","Yah I don't want to sterotype either, just throwing it out there. Maybe he has suffered some sort of abuse, so his mind is more prone to thinking those actions areok","p016","p019",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
10048,133,423,20,"Person 1","Yeah. Just sad all around, I guess. :(","p016","p019",2.3333,2,1.3333,2
10049,133,423,21,"Person 2","For sure....","p016","p019",2,1.3333,1.3333,1
10050,133,423,22,"Person 1","Well, if we've covered everything, it was nice talking to you. :) bye!","p016","p019",2,0,1.3333,1
10051,133,423,23,"Person 2","you too! bye","p016","p019",2,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
10052,133,424,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p024","p010",1,1,0.6667,1
10053,133,424,1,"Person 2","My first impression is what is wrong with people.   Why would you pick it up and then throw it down to the ground?   If you hurt animals, something is really off.   What about your?","p024","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
10054,133,424,2,"Person 1","Exactly. Imagine having that cold of a heart that you kill a harmless animal in that manner.","p024","p010",3,2,2.6667,2
10055,133,424,3,"Person 2","I am a firm believer that if you do hurt animals you are either a psychopath or sociopath.    I wonder if the story was true about Pinky?","p024","p010",4,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
10056,133,424,4,"Person 1","I think its a real story. Witnesses said that he picked up a different flamingo but put it down before getting the other one.","p024","p010",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
10057,133,424,5,"Person 2","I wonder what was different in his mind on the second flamingo?","p024","p010",2,1,0.6667,1.3333
10058,133,424,6,"Person 1","it was probably smaller","p024","p010",1,1,1,1
10059,133,424,7,"Person 2","I wish they had included the video of Pinky dancing :)","p024","p010",1,0.3333,0.6667,1.3333
10060,133,424,8,"Person 1","pinky was already 19 years old thats sad","p024","p010",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
10061,133,424,9,"Person 2","It is.   I have no idea what the life span is of a flamingo?   Do you?","p024","p010",2,1,1,1
10062,133,424,10,"Person 1","no idea either","p024","p010",1,1,1,1
10063,133,424,11,"Person 2","Even though it was a horrendous act, I do not see jailing someone.   He should have had to do a lot of community service and pay a hefty fine.  Thoughts?","p024","p010",2,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
10064,133,424,12,"Person 1","he needs a fine and jail time in prison","p024","p010",3,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
10065,133,424,13,"Person 2","You think?   Our prisons are overflowing.","p024","p010",2,1.3333,0.6667,2
10066,133,424,14,"Person 1","yep and those prisons have people that are unfairly in prison. i think you mean we need a better justice system.","p024","p010",3,1.3333,1,2.3333
10067,133,424,15,"Person 2","Totally agree.  The Netflix show about the Central Park murder was so distressing.  Did you see it?","p024","p010",3.3333,1.6667,1,1.6667
10068,133,424,16,"Person 1","yeah i believe so","p024","p010",1.3333,1,1,1
10069,133,424,17,"Person 2","All those boys that did nothing were jailed.   The only reason they were chosen was because they were in the area and the police and DA just wanted to find someone quickly.  (:","p024","p010",3,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
10070,133,424,18,"Person 1","yep happens everyday in america unfotunately. some people make money off having full prisons","p024","p010",2.6667,2,1,2.3333

10074,133,425,1,"Person 2","It was really sad.   Why would any human being kill a flamingo in a zoo","p019","p010",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
10075,133,425,2,"Person 1","i have no idea... some kind of evil in him","p019","p010",2.6667,2,3.3333,1.3333
10076,133,425,3,"Person 2","Something - the fine was way too small in my opinion","p019","p010",2,1.6667,3,1.3333
10077,133,425,4,"Person 1","agreed... he killed an animal, for no reason, in public. Should have been a way harsher punisshment","p019","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
10078,133,425,5,"Person 2","Busch gardens is so beautiful - he must be psychopath since he hurts animals","p019","p010",3,2,3,1.3333

10080,133,425,7,"Person 2","Normally it's packed - I'm sure people were videoing it but never stopped to help.   That kills me - videoing the attack but doing nothing","p019","p010",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
10081,133,425,8,"Person 1","That would be awful... People have become so disassociated","p019","p010",3.3333,2,3,1.3333
10082,133,425,9,"Person 2","They really have.   Humanity as we use to know is slowly slipping away","p019","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.3333

10086,133,425,13,"Person 2","It really bothers me - people seldom help others anymore.","p019","p010",3,1.3333,3,2
10087,133,425,14,"Person 1","Yah I've noticed that too... We either think they are not deserving of help or think that we'renot in a position to help, when most likely we are","p019","p010",2.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
10088,133,425,15,"Person 2","We are - the numbers of people that are homeless or living in welfare situations are now viewed if they would only try - so much more they won't accept.   Mental illness is part of homelessness and poverty is a result that our wages are not keeping up with what it just costs to live anymore.","p019","p010",3,2,2.6667,2.3333
10089,133,425,16,"Person 1","Yes! But no one can afford help for their mental illness! Minimum wage hasn't gone up in 10 years... how crazy is that","p019","p010",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
10090,133,425,17,"Person 2","Very crazy when housing has gone up from 25-50%.    No healthcare - no family to check on their state of mind.   I see many veterans that need so much.","p019","p010",3,2,2.3333,3
10091,133,425,18,"Person 1","Me too... but yet we as a country seem to be able to afford to help other countries","p019","p010",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667

10099,397,426,5,"Person 2","I wonder what will be done to fix the destruction.","p039","p022",2,1,1.3333,1.3333
10100,397,426,6,"Person 1","probably nothing humans don't really care","p039","p022",1,2,1.6667,1.6667

10109,397,426,15,"Person 2","That's a pretty good deal. I hope you will treat it well because it's sad what humans are doing to animals.","p039","p022",3,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
10110,397,426,16,"Person 1","I will but I will also eat all of her male offspring slit their throat most likely and make delicious goat tacos","p039","p022",2.6667,1.3333,1,2.6667

10115,397,427,0,"Person 1","hey were you as sad as me about whats going on","p068","p016",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
10116,397,427,1,"Person 2","Yeah. I think we tend to forget how important water is in the US (or at least some parts), but wow.","p068","p016",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
10117,397,427,2,"Person 1","yeah when animals thrive on it and people need those animals it can ruin alot","p068","p016",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10118,397,427,3,"Person 2","Yeah. I was stunned when it said 80% of the capybaras had died. That's insane.","p068","p016",3.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
10119,397,427,4,"Person 1","yeah i wonder if they are endanger of extinction now so sad","p068","p016",3,2,2.3333,1.6667
10120,397,427,5,"Person 2","Probably not overall, but certainly that segment is. And the one that was like 98% gone, I forget the species, but yikes.","p068","p016",3.3333,2,2,1.3333
10121,397,427,6,"Person 1","such large numbers you think more would be deing done to help","p068","p016",2.3333,1,1.6667,1.3333
10122,397,427,7,"Person 2","Yeah. It sounds like the governments didn't handle it well at all.","p068","p016",2,1.6667,1.3333,1
10123,397,427,8,"Person 1","they probably dont have enough money or resources","p068","p016",1.6667,1.6667,1.3333,1
10124,397,427,9,"Person 2","I mean, the article made it seems like the two governments took responsibility for it, so. It seems like the way water was divided between Paraguay and Argentina was partially responsible for the discrepancy.","p068","p016",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
10125,397,427,10,"Person 1","yeah but they said if its not figired out soon this will happen for years to come how scary","p068","p016",3,2,2,1.3333
10126,397,427,11,"Person 2","True. And with the replenishing season not coming until January, that's a long wait.","p068","p016",2,1.3333,1.6667,1
10127,397,427,12,"Person 1","true i wonder what can/will be done for these animals, they should have crews go along and pick up fish struggling to relocate them","p068","p016",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10128,397,427,13,"Person 2","The question would be relocate where? If you move populations like that you run the risk of messing up the ecological balance of the new place.","p068","p016",2,1.3333,1.6667,1.3333
10129,397,427,14,"Person 1","maybe a nearby zoo to rehabiliate or hold them to wait for the water to comeback","p068","p016",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.3333
10130,397,427,15,"Person 2","Do zoos usually have fish populations? idk. Maybe a wildlife reservation could take on some of the land animals, but I'm not familiar with best practices for moving fish.","p068","p016",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
10131,397,427,16,"Person 1","yeah where i am they have fish farms and hatcherys you can go visit maybe something of that nature and our zoos have huge aquariums for fish","p068","p016",1,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
10132,397,427,17,"Person 2","Ah okay, yeah a fish hatchery would work. But then they might get eaten and that's slightly self defeating haha. :P It's so sad to think of all the animals getting caught in the mud and sediment. :( I can't imagine the fall out from a 520 or whatever empty river.","p068","p016",3,2,3.3333,2
10133,397,427,18,"Person 1","oh i know the image of them breathing in mud will be stuck with me all day its so sad","p068","p016",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.3333
10134,397,427,19,"Person 2",":( :( It's an awful way to go. Natural disasters are hard to wrap your mind around because it reminds you of how much we just can't fix.","p068","p016",3.3333,2,3.3333,1.6667
10135,397,427,20,"Person 1","I know so horrible! its been a great chat bye!","p068","p016",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.3333
10136,397,427,21,"Person 2","bye!","p068","p016",2,1,1,1
10137,397,428,0,"Person 1","Well, I thought this was sad for the animals.  But it's one of those situations where there's not much anyone can do.  What was your take on it?","p029","p024",2,2,3,2
10138,397,428,1,"Person 2","Yeah, we need to do better in protecting these animals.","p029","p024",2.6667,0.6667,3,1.6667
10139,397,428,2,"Person 1","What do you think can be done?","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
10140,397,428,3,"Person 2","I think educating people on the consequences but at this point I don't know what can be done to be honest. What about you?","p029","p024",2,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
10141,397,428,4,"Person 1","I agree, I think it's really up to nature which we cannot control","p029","p024",2,2,1,1.3333
10142,397,428,5,"Person 2","What do you think might of caused the river to go dry?","p029","p024",1.3333,1,1,1
10143,397,428,6,"Person 1","My guess would be just natural fluctuations in the weather.  Kinda hard to say.  I guess it could be any number of things really.","p029","p024",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
10144,397,428,7,"Person 2","I think they should build more artifical canals and stuff like that if possible.","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
10145,397,428,8,"Person 1","That could possibly help, I think it would be worth exploring ideas like that.  I wonder if they have?","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333
10146,397,428,9,"Person 2","I think the article said that was being done in some countries","p029","p024",1,0.6667,1,1
10147,397,428,10,"Person 1","I wonder why they are not doing it there, did it say?","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1,1
10148,397,428,11,"Person 2","no idea, why do you think they haven't done it yet?","p029","p024",1.3333,1,1,1
10149,397,428,12,"Person 1","Perhaps financial reasons, what do you think?","p029","p024",1.3333,1,1,1
10150,397,428,13,"Person 2","Most likely. Paraguay isn't the richest country","p029","p024",1.6667,1,1,1
10151,397,428,14,"Person 1","Yeah I don't know much about it but it doesn't seem like a very industrialized, thriving nation","p029","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1,1
10152,397,428,15,"Person 2","yep I've heard about Paraguay when their team is participating in a world cup","p029","p024",0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,2
10153,397,428,16,"Person 1","hahaha yeah, same.  B ut not much economic news","p029","p024",2,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
10154,397,428,17,"Person 2","yeah never hear anything about them lol","p029","p024",2,1.6667,0.6667,1.3333
10155,397,428,18,"Person 1","me either, they're like a ghost country","p029","p024",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1.3333
10156,397,428,19,"Person 2","yeah i dont even know who their president is or if they have one. but back to the article, I hope things change and they find a way to save these animals","p029","p024",2.3333,0.6667,3,2
10157,397,428,20,"Person 1","Yeah I don't know either.  Are they even a democracy or what?  Anyway, I hope things change, too, for the sake of the animals.  well I must go, it's been nice speaking with you.  goodbye","p029","p024",2.3333,0,2.6667,2
10158,397,428,21,"Person 2","bye","p029","p024",1,1,0.6667,1
10159,397,429,0,"Person 1","I think climate change is going effect us all very soon.","p035","p073",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
10160,397,429,1,"Person 2","I don't know if it is or isn't, but this seems to be effecting the population of wildlife in this area right now. It makes me so sad to think of these poor animals trying to find water.","p035","p073",3,2,3,2.6667
10161,397,429,2,"Person 1","Yeah the animals are suffering","p035","p073",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
10162,397,429,3,"Person 2","It seems like it might be partly a political issue because the area forms the border of two countries, and one side is fine with water.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
10163,397,429,4,"Person 1","I agree with that, but the animals do not care about politics","p035","p073",2,2,1.6667,2
10164,397,429,5,"Person 2","They don't care, but it seems that the two countries have to figure out a way to keep this from happening.","p035","p073",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667
10165,397,429,6,"Person 1","I agree, but who should be in charge of enforcing environmental rules?","p035","p073",2,0.3333,1,1.3333
10166,397,429,7,"Person 2","That's a good question. I guess I am naive in thinking that the countries would work together.","p035","p073",2,1,1,2
10167,397,429,8,"Person 1","Yeah I don't think they will work together.","p035","p073",2,1.3333,1,1.3333
10168,397,429,9,"Person 2","I think Paraguay, the side that is bad, is the side being accused of mismanagement. So maybe if they figure out a way to use the water better, they can help.","p035","p073",2,0.6667,1,2.3333
10169,397,429,10,"Person 1","Do you believe in climate change?","p035","p073",1.3333,1.3333,0.6667,1
10170,397,429,11,"Person 2","I believe in climate change. The climate has obviously changed a lot over the time the earth has existed. I don't know how much of climate changes is due to people or to natural changes.","p035","p073",2,1,1.3333,2.6667
10171,397,429,12,"Person 1","Yeah that is a real debate, I think it is man caused like the river issues in this story.","p035","p073",1.3333,2,1,2.3333
10172,397,429,13,"Person 2","I think in this situation, they are obviously having  a drought this season. I don't think one or two years of drought would necessarily signify climate change. And the larger problem is that people are taking the water for their own uses and leaving the area dry.","p035","p073",2,2,1.6667,2.3333
10173,397,429,14,"Person 1","I agree that droughts are natural and they happen. This is a real complex issue.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.6667
10174,397,429,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I agree! I don't think we are going to solve it in this short conversation!","p035","p073",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
10175,397,429,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I think this debate will go on for a long time.","p035","p073",1.6667,1.3333,1,1.3333
10176,397,429,17,"Person 2","It's been good chatting with you!","p035","p073",2,0,1.3333,1.3333

10180,397,430,1,"Person 2","I definitely thought it was sad for the animals although it did not pull at my heartstrings like some of the other stories I have read on here.  What did you think","p022","p029",2,2,2,2
10181,397,430,2,"Person 1","I feel sad because even though it's not as sad now, it will affect them mroe in the future","p022","p029",2.3333,2,3,2
10182,397,430,3,"Person 2","yeah no doubt and they are really helpless victims of the whole thing","p022","p029",2.3333,2,3.6667,1.6667
10183,397,430,4,"Person 1","It's because of humans do you think?","p022","p029",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.3333
10184,397,430,5,"Person 2","yes most definitely, and I mean natural causes such as the drought surely play a part but it seems people could do something to help","p022","p029",3,1.6667,2,1.3333
10185,397,430,6,"Person 1","I wish there was a way we can donate","p022","p029",2.3333,1,2.6667,1.3333
10186,397,430,7,"Person 2","yeah there might be if you looked?","p022","p029",1.3333,1,2.3333,1
10187,397,430,8,"Person 1","There are charity but you never know if the money actually goes to the right places","p022","p029",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.3333
10188,397,430,9,"Person 2","yeah that is why I am suspicious of charity.  it seems a lot are wasteful","p022","p029",2.6667,2,1,2
10189,397,430,10,"Person 1","I agree, most of the money goes to bad intentions!","p022","p029",3,2,1,1.6667
10190,397,430,11,"Person 2","yeah it is sad that that is the case","p022","p029",2.3333,2,1.6667,1.6667
10191,397,430,12,"Person 1","I wish the money could help the animals somehow. They really need it","p022","p029",3,0.6667,3.6667,1.6667
10192,397,430,13,"Person 2","yeah they can't even advocate for themselves","p022","p029",2.3333,2,3,1.3333
10193,397,430,14,"Person 1","Yes! I definitely feel guilty because ive littered before and not recycle","p022","p029",2.6667,2,2,2.6667
10194,397,430,15,"Person 2","I do not recycle either but it is very difficult where I Live.  I try to make up in other ways.","p022","p029",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,2.6667

10549,11,447,6,"Person 1","yeah, wonder why they think that's the best plan","p029","p039",2,1.6667,1,2
10550,11,447,7,"Person 2","maybe its a global conspiracy","p029","p039",1.6667,1.3333,0.6667,2.6667
10551,11,447,8,"Person 1","how so?","p029","p039",1.3333,1,0.6667,1
10552,11,447,9,"Person 2","i think there is a conspiracy to bring about a single currency probably based on crypto won't happen till there is a depression and war though","p029","p039",2.3333,2,0.6667,3
10553,11,447,10,"Person 1","hmm, what makes you think that?  sounds a bit radical to me","p029","p039",2.3333,1.3333,1,2
10554,11,447,11,"Person 2","its simple math really look at the amount of global debt being piled on its already gone past the tipping point and now central banks are experimenting with negative interest rates everyone knows where this is headed no president or prime minister is going to stop it they just hope it doesn't all implode on their watch","p029","p039",2.6667,1.6667,0.6667,3
10555,11,447,12,"Person 1","maybe so, who knows.  I just try to live my simple little life and be happy.  It's unfortunate for these people caught up in the crossfire though","p029","p039",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
10556,11,447,13,"Person 2","live your life but slowly prepare yourself for the collapse and yea sucks to be pawns","p029","p039",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.6667
10557,11,447,14,"Person 1","I'm not really worried about the \"collapse\" to be honest.  People have been fearing that since 2000.  Nothing has yet to happen.  It's like climate change in my opinion, fears blown out of proportion.  But who knows, guess time will tell","p029","p039",2.3333,1,1,3
10558,11,447,15,"Person 2","it did happen in 2008 but it wasn't allowed to fully happen they kicked the can down the road bought some more time but I will tell you that they just created a much larger bubble and 2008 will look like a picnic","p029","p039",3,1.6667,1,3
10559,11,447,16,"Person 1","2008 was just a recession, those are a naturally occurring part of an economy.  But back to the article, what did you think about the people being harmed?","p029","p039",2,1,1,2
10560,11,447,17,"Person 2","is negative interest rates on sovereign rate funds naturally occurring? I thought those people are casualties of the life they were born in to bad luck I suppose","p029","p039",2.3333,2,0.6667,3.3333

10565,11,448,2,"Person 1","They're both nuclear powers so that makes the tensions more meaningful, though they've refrained from using nuclear weapons to this point.","p062","p024",2,1.6667,1,1.6667
10566,11,448,3,"Person 2","Do you think India should face consequences for what they did?","p062","p024",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
10567,11,448,4,"Person 1","I guess I feel like I don't know enough about the back-and-forth.  I fully believe that terrorist groups exist in Pakistan.  And I think India has a right to defend itself.","p062","p024",2.3333,1,1.3333,2
10568,11,448,5,"Person 2","Pakistan is definitely known for taking good care of terrorists.","p062","p024",2.6667,2,1.3333,1.6667
10569,11,448,6,"Person 1","Indeed.  I'd guess they're typically the cause of any escalation in tensions.","p062","p024",2.3333,2,1.3333,1.6667

10571,11,448,8,"Person 1","Yes.  Pakistan has a very bad history of harboring terrorists.  And I'm sure there are plenty of radical folks who would like to actively fight India.","p062","p024",2.3333,2,1,2.3333
10572,11,448,9,"Person 2","do you think there will be another was between the two?","p062","p024",1.6667,1,1,1
10573,11,448,10,"Person 1","I'm sure there will continue to be skirmishes like this.  But an all-out war between these two countries would be massive, with the potential for nuclear strikes.  I doubt we'll see something like that in our lifetime.","p062","p024",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
10574,11,448,11,"Person 2","I wouldn't doubt anything anymore to be honest after seeing somebody like Donald Trump getting elected.","p062","p024",2.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333
10575,11,448,12,"Person 1","I suppose, but I think there's a difference between casting a ballot for someone and entering into an existential war.  Look at Putin.  He's ruthless.  He hasn't fought a large-scale war.  Everything now is skirmishes and proxy wars and terrorism and stuff like that.","p062","p024",2.3333,2,1,2.3333
10576,11,448,13,"Person 2","Everyone knows the dangers of nuclear power . Before all they had was airstrikes and guns.","p062","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1,2
10577,11,448,14,"Person 1","I thought the last line of the article was sort of funny, that Bollywood directors aren't hiring Pakistani actors because of this.  Just thought that was a sort of trivial way to end the article.","p062","p024",2.3333,0.3333,0.6667,2
10578,11,448,15,"Person 2","lol that made me laugh went from serious to comedy real quick","p062","p024",3,0,0.6667,2
10579,11,448,16,"Person 1","Although that may be what the majority of Indian people care most about.  Who knows.  In the US we'd spend a lot of time concerning ourselves with what actors were saying on Twitter.","p062","p024",2.6667,1,0.6667,1.6667

10629,182,451,2,"Person 1","yea it is people are sick","p039","p019",3,2,3,2
10630,182,451,3,"Person 2","Like dumping a kitten is one thing, but wrapping it up the way he did? That's evil","p039","p019",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
10631,182,451,4,"Person 1","probably some satanic ritual they like to use cats","p039","p019",3.3333,2,2.6667,2
10632,182,451,5,"Person 2","Ew I didn't even think about that. It could be","p039","p019",3,1.3333,2,2
10633,182,451,6,"Person 1","yea they do all kinds of sick depraved acts to animals","p039","p019",3.6667,2,3,2
10634,182,451,7,"Person 2","Yah... I just don't get it. They  can feel pain just as much as us...","p039","p019",3,2,4,1.6667
10635,182,451,8,"Person 1","yea what do you think about the people trying to save these animals do you think they should spend their time to help human children first","p039","p019",2,1,2.3333,1.6667
10636,182,451,9,"Person 2","I mean I think that all causes should be represented. Given children are more important, but animals need a voice too.","p039","p019",2.6667,0.3333,3,2
10637,182,451,10,"Person 1","yes they do but do you think a minute spent to save animals is one less minute you could give to kids dying in chicago everyday","p039","p019",2.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
10638,182,451,11,"Person 2","That is true, but you have to think, their drive is now for saving animals. They'll be more passionate and productive in that aspect. People are going to do what their going to do,i'll just be happy its a good thing they're doing.","p039","p019",2.6667,0,2.6667,2.6667
10639,182,451,12,"Person 1","I suppose personally I would kill all the kittens in america if it would ensure the life of one human child","p039","p019",3.6667,2,1.3333,2.3333
10640,182,451,13,"Person 2","That is hard to think about... But I think i could come to the same conclusion.","p039","p019",3,1.6667,1.6667,2
10641,182,451,14,"Person 1","yea its tough but I value human life more then animal life like there is no way I would give money to any animal charity because there is still too much human suffering to solve first","p039","p019",3.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
10642,182,451,15,"Person 2","I agree with that as well.. I think the amount americans spend on unneccary animal stuff is crazy when there are people starving to death or can't afford medical stuff","p039","p019",3.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
10643,182,451,16,"Person 1","i know people are literally starving to death around the world everyday drinking dirty shit water while we spend billions on animals","p039","p019",3.6667,2,1.6667,2
10644,182,451,17,"Person 2","I know, it's kind of crazy. I do think that we should still take care of animals and care about them, but not to the extent that a lot of people do. Like don't buy your dog a sweater or halloween outfit. Donate to a charity or something.","p039","p019",2.3333,2,1.6667,2.3333

10647,182,452,0,"Person 1","This particular article was really trying to pull on the heartstrings.","p030","p062",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,2
10648,182,452,1,"Person 2","Yes, it was a pretty grisly image it portrayed of what happened to the kitten.","p030","p062",3,2,2.6667,2
10649,182,452,2,"Person 1","Yeah, the amount of detail and effort put into trying to encourage the reader to vicariously live out the last moments of its life was a little off putting.","p030","p062",3.3333,2,2,2.3333
10650,182,452,3,"Person 2","Yeah, they were clearly trying to influence people to join their cause for justice and animal equality.","p030","p062",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2
10651,182,452,4,"Person 1","That tactic is used by a lot of animal rights groups and frankly, it has the opposite effect on me personally. I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat.","p030","p062",3.6667,1.6667,1.3333,3
10652,182,452,5,"Person 2","Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here.","p030","p062",3,1.6667,1,2.6667
10653,182,452,6,"Person 1","Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof.","p030","p062",3.3333,2,1,2.3333
10654,182,452,7,"Person 2","For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal \"equality.\"  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility.","p030","p062",3.6667,2,1,2.6667
10655,182,452,8,"Person 1","I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning.","p030","p062",3.3333,1.6667,0.6667,3
10656,182,452,9,"Person 2","Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim.","p030","p062",3,1.6667,0.6667,2.6667
10657,182,452,10,"Person 1","Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!","p030","p062",3.6667,2,0.6667,3
10658,182,452,11,"Person 2","Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?","p030","p062",2,1.3333,1,1.6667
10659,182,452,12,"Person 1","Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle.","p030","p062",1.6667,1.6667,0.6667,2.3333
10660,182,452,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.  In this case it would be interesting to see if the citizens track down the culprit.","p030","p062",2,1,1,1.6667
10661,182,452,14,"Person 1","Supremely doubtful, it's not like they have the help of law enforcement or anything. They are basically going vigilante in the hopes of solving a case with no evidence or power to investigate.","p030","p062",2,1.6667,0.6667,2
10662,182,452,15,"Person 2","I suppose it depends on where the kitten came from.  If someone had a litter and gave them away it could be found out.  Either way I don't really care.","p030","p062",1.3333,1.6667,0.6667,2.3333
10663,182,452,16,"Person 1","That's the long and short of it right? Wouldn't the time be better spent fostering living pets or something similar?","p030","p062",2,1.6667,0.6667,1.6667
10664,182,452,17,"Person 2","I agree.  I feel sad at the thought of a tortured cat.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over a dead cat, just like I don't break down when I see a squirrel squished on the road.","p030","p062",2,2,1,2.3333
10665,182,452,18,"Person 1","There are certainly more personal and pressing things to lose sleep over. Well, thanks for chatting today. Have a good one! bye","p030","p062",1.6667,0,0.6667,1.6667

10775,371,457,20,"Person 1","bye!","p016","p039",1.6667,1,0.6667,1.3333
10776,371,458,0,"Person 1","How do you feel about cops punching women?","p062","p029",2.3333,1.3333,1,1
10777,371,458,1,"Person 2","I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?","p062","p029",3.3333,2,0.6667,3
10778,371,458,2,"Person 1","I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop.","p062","p029",3.3333,1.3333,1.3333,3
10779,371,458,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this.","p062","p029",3.6667,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
10780,371,458,4,"Person 1","That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  \"Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?\"  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety.","p062","p029",4.3333,1.6667,1.3333,3
10781,371,458,5,"Person 2","Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.","p062","p029",3.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
10782,371,458,6,"Person 1","Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.","p062","p029",4.3333,1,1.3333,2.6667
10783,371,458,7,"Person 2","Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the \"victim\" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problems","p062","p029",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
10784,371,458,8,"Person 1","Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.","p062","p029",3.6667,2,1.6667,2.3333
10785,371,458,9,"Person 2","yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of others","p062","p029",3.3333,2,1.6667,2
10786,371,458,10,"Person 1","Imagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly.","p062","p029",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
10787,371,458,11,"Person 2","Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neck","p062","p029",2.6667,2,1.6667,2
10788,371,458,12,"Person 1","Yeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person.","p062","p029",4.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.6667
10789,371,458,13,"Person 2","Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up.","p062","p029",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
10790,371,458,14,"Person 1","Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science.","p062","p029",4,1,1.6667,2.6667
10791,371,458,15,"Person 2","Same here, I've been annoyed before but I've always been treated fairly and with decent courtesy.","p062","p029",3.3333,1,1.3333,2.6667
10792,371,458,16,"Person 1","Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent.","p062","p029",3,1.6667,1.3333,1.6667
10793,371,458,17,"Person 2","Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid.","p062","p029",4.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2
10794,371,458,18,"Person 1","Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful.","p062","p029",4,2,1.3333,2
10795,371,458,19,"Person 2","Yep, we sure do.  You said it better than I.  Well I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye","p062","p029",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
10796,371,458,20,"Person 1","Yeah, have a great day.  Nice chatting with you.  goodbye","p062","p029",2.3333,0.6667,1,1.6667
10797,371,459,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article? I thought the cop was wrong in this.","p024","p036",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
10798,371,459,1,"Person 2","I do agree that the officer is incorrect here. I can't even figure out why they were detaining her in the first place. Did you see that part? Was it an expired or already served warrant?","p024","p036",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
10799,371,459,2,"Person 1","She was saying the issue was resolved, so by that I guess she called for help but no longer needed it? Not sure!","p024","p036",3,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
10800,371,459,3,"Person 2","Regardless, I have a friend who was arrested and the only charge was resisting arrest. How does that even work? How can your only charge be resisting arrest? What arrest were you resisting if there are no other charges?","p024","p036",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,3
10801,371,459,4,"Person 1","Yeah its weird how the law works for some and not for others. If she tells you the issue is resolved one would think that's the cue to move on to the next call.","p024","p036",2.6667,1.6667,2,2.3333
10802,371,459,5,"Person 2","Absolutely. It seems like they are wasting time. And then they punch her!","p024","p036",3.6667,1.3333,3.3333,1.6667
10803,371,459,6,"Person 1","Seems to me like cops are undertrained. Anybody can be a cop and it shouldn't be that way.","p024","p036",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
10804,371,459,7,"Person 2","I had to track down the video, by the way. There is no dispute that she was legitimately punched in the face. It isn't like a maybe she was punched: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cop-punches-woman-video_n_582ddbd0e4b030997bbdd8c3","p024","p036",4,1.3333,3.3333,2.6667
10805,371,459,8,"Person 1","wow thats crazy to watch","p024","p036",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
10806,371,459,9,"Person 2","And what makes me most upset is that her kids saw it. I really feel bad for the kids. Look, maybe mom isn't the best if she had a warrant at one point, but those poor kids seeing her get punched in the face.","p024","p036",4.3333,2,4.6667,3
10807,371,459,10,"Person 1","the kids will never forget that image as long as theyre alive","p024","p036",4,1.6667,4,2.3333
10808,371,459,11,"Person 2","I am sure of that. I guess since this study seems to be about empathy, what do we feel from the officer's perspective?","p024","p036",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
10809,371,459,12,"Person 1","Thats a tough one...what do you feel?","p024","p036",2,1,1,1.3333
10810,371,459,13,"Person 2","I mean, I understand it is a high stress job. So let's assume there was a clerical error and he sincerely believed there was a warrant for her. If she is denying that, then maybe he did feel she was resisting. I mean, I have trouble with the idea of punching her in the face, but we don't know what the warrant may have been.","p024","p036",2.6667,1.3333,2,3
10811,371,459,14,"Person 1","I know most cops are good definitely. It's just when these things happen it buries all the good and brings all the bad to the forefront.","p024","p036",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
10812,371,459,15,"Person 2","I am very much in favor of monitoring the police and I think the same is said for \"my\" side of this - there is a lot of good in the people who want to police to be carefully monitored, but there are a few bad apples that ruin it - like the people who killed the cops in Texas.","p024","p036",3.3333,0.6667,2.6667,3
10813,371,459,16,"Person 1","we need to find a way to monitor them as they have guns and the majority of citizens do not.","p024","p036",3,1.3333,2.3333,2
10814,371,459,17,"Person 2","I agree, and I think you said before that they need better training?","p024","p036",2.3333,1,2,1.6667
10815,371,459,18,"Person 1","yes thats what I think, do you?","p024","p036",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.6667
10816,371,459,19,"Person 2","I always thought that was the case, but one friend of mine said cops are trained to kill witht heir guns, not to incapacitate - on purpose. This guy was a cop too, so I don't know. Maybe it isn't more training, but better training?","p024","p036",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,3
10817,371,459,20,"Person 1","Yes quality over quantity","p024","p036",2,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667
10818,371,459,21,"Person 2","I think so. That is ten turns, by the way.","p024","p036",1,1,1.3333,1.3333

10825,371,460,4,"Person 1","I agree this was just out of anger","p068","p024",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
10826,371,460,5,"Person 2","yeah someone needs to give therapy to these cops so they dont let their anger out on civilians","p068","p024",2,2,2.3333,2.3333
10827,371,460,6,"Person 1","I agree some kind of work counseling","p068","p024",1.6667,1,3,1.6667

10829,371,460,8,"Person 1","I agree like the suicide rate among them is going up","p068","p024",1.6667,1.3333,3,2
10830,371,460,9,"Person 2","yeah a lot of pressure and danger they face every single day","p068","p024",1.6667,1.6667,2,2

10846,18,461,5,"Person 2","I agree what a silly way for them to die so preventable","p022","p068",3,2,3.6667,2
10847,18,461,6,"Person 1","It's just sad that there are still wars going on and people are dying. We should be better than that.","p022","p068",4,2,4,2.3333
10848,18,461,7,"Person 2","i agree but it is complicated","p022","p068",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,2

10861,18,462,0,"Person 1","Did you have a particularly strong emotional reaction to this article?","p030","p019",1.6667,1,1.6667,1
10862,18,462,1,"Person 2","It made me feel concerned.","p030","p019",2.3333,1.6667,3.3333,2.3333
10863,18,462,2,"Person 1","How so?","p030","p019",1.3333,1,1,1
10864,18,462,3,"Person 2","Becuase it seems like this is going to be another very long, deathly war that we are fighting for who knows what reason","p030","p019",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
10865,18,462,4,"Person 1","Which war in particular? I read this as an isolated incident concerning an ally and miscommunication.","p030","p019",2.3333,1,2.6667,1.6667
10866,18,462,5,"Person 2","The war that is starting in Syria... America is starting to send troops over there. How did this article make you feel","p030","p019",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2
10867,18,462,6,"Person 1","The Syrian civil war has been going on for eight years and America has been at least tacitly involved since the get go. Anyway, I think that this was just Jordanian soldiers being a little jumpy because of the recent terrorist attack and American soldiers not following protocol.","p030","p019",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
10868,18,462,7,"Person 2","You sound knowledgeable on this subject. That makes sense though... Do you think there is any resolution in the near future for this war?","p030","p019",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2
10869,18,462,8,"Person 1","It's a war of attrition that has many foreign interests in play. The fact that it boils down to having a secular government or a Muslim government makes it even more volatile. Since there have been hundreds of thousands of refugees and more than half of the internal population displaced, I think the question is: What will be left to claim if it ever does end?","p030","p019",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
10870,18,462,9,"Person 2","That is a gruesome statement.... hard to think about. But it makes sens","p030","p019",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
10871,18,462,10,"Person 1","It's just the new imperialism. Instead of actively occupying a region with strategic value, just install a government that will play ball and silently control policy within the country from abroad.","p030","p019",2.6667,1.6667,3,2.3333
10872,18,462,11,"Person 2","That sounds very unfair for the people living in that country... Sad that this still goes on and there is no real end in sight.","p030","p019",3.3333,2,2.6667,2.6667
10873,18,462,12,"Person 1","Quite. But, the fact is these countries couldn't properly function without aid from more developed nations. Governments use that as leverage and the populaces interests fall by the wayside.","p030","p019",3,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
10874,18,462,13,"Person 2","How do you know so much about all this? It's interesting to learn all this, as my knowledge is lacking in that area, as Im sure you can tell","p030","p019",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
10875,18,462,14,"Person 1","I really don't know very much at all, but I do try to keep up with international politics. It's something I never could have pictured myself doing even five years ago because it can be very depressing, but here we are. Plus, I like history and learning about other cultures.","p030","p019",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.6667
10876,18,462,15,"Person 2","Good for you! We could all stand to be more aware of what is going on in the world. It's so easy to avoid, because it is sad.","p030","p019",3,1,3,2
10877,18,462,16,"Person 1","It's also very telling about the core concepts of human nature. It's a shame that we've essentially been solving disputes the same way since the beginning of recorded history.","p030","p019",3,1.3333,2.3333,2
10878,18,462,17,"Person 2","It is... It's crazy with how far we have come as a human race, we have more or less stayed the same in a lot of ways.","p030","p019",3,1.3333,2.3333,2
10879,18,462,18,"Person 1","Yep, well thanks for chatting today. Hope you have a pleasant afternoon! bye","p030","p019",2,0.3333,2,1.6667

10885,18,463,2,"Person 1","Yes, I thought so too, like a misunderstanding gone terribly wrong","p029","p024",3,1.6667,3,2
10886,18,463,3,"Person 2","yeah unfortunately maybe the military trainers didn't see or realize they had  to stop the vehicle.","p029","p024",2.3333,2,2.6667,2
10887,18,463,4,"Person 1","Yeah, they probably need to review protocol and make sure everyone is really clear going forward","p029","p024",1.6667,1,2.6667,2.6667
10888,18,463,5,"Person 2","yeah i wonder why they didnt realize they had to stop though. you would think they go through extensive training","p029","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
10889,18,463,6,"Person 1","yeah you would think, maybe some sort of oversight?  Quite a serious one.","p029","p024",2,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
10890,18,463,7,"Person 2","yeah or maps detailing stops and all of that","p029","p024",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
10891,18,463,8,"Person 1","Yeah seriously, you would think they would have known.  there were also three of them","p029","p024",3,1.6667,2,2
10892,18,463,9,"Person 2","thats crazy..","p029","p024",2.6667,1,2.6667,1.6667
10893,18,463,10,"Person 1","yeah, like you would think one would have said something","p029","p024",2.3333,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
10894,18,463,11,"Person 2","makes you wonder if they knew but didnt stop on purpose","p029","p024",2,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10895,18,463,12,"Person 1","yeah, but why?  just to be defiant?  rogue?  suicidal??","p029","p024",2.6667,1.6667,2,1.6667
10896,18,463,13,"Person 2","im thinking they were probably rogue","p029","p024",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
10897,18,463,14,"Person 1","Yeah that would probably make the most sense","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,2
10898,18,463,15,"Person 2","hopefully things become clearer","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10899,18,463,16,"Person 1","yes, the article didn't give much resolution","p029","p024",1.6667,1,2,1.6667
10900,18,463,17,"Person 2","wish they cleared things up more at the end of the article","p029","p024",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
10901,18,463,18,"Person 1","me too.  I was left feeling confused.  Well it has been a great talk, goodbye","p029","p024",2,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
10902,18,463,19,"Person 2","bye","p029","p024",1,1,1,1
10903,18,464,0,"Person 1","Do you think it is more to the story of the shootout?","p035","p039",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1
10904,18,464,1,"Person 2","perhaps could be a coverup but honestly we need to bring all our troops home","p035","p039",2.6667,1.3333,3,2
10905,18,464,2,"Person 1","I agree with that.","p035","p039",1.6667,1,2.3333,1.3333
10906,18,464,3,"Person 2","yea we spend billions on policing the world while there are places in america that look like a third world slum","p035","p039",3,1.3333,2,1.3333
10907,18,464,4,"Person 1","I agree with that too. We should fix America first.","p035","p039",2.6667,0.6667,2,1.3333
10908,18,464,5,"Person 2","exactly use the troops to protect our borders and defend against any attack on the homeland we wouldn't have an immigration problem or a need for a wall if we used our troops the way the founding fathers envisioned","p035","p039",3.6667,1.3333,2,1.3333
10909,18,464,6,"Person 1","I would take that better than spending billions on a wall.","p035","p039",2.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10910,18,464,7,"Person 2","i know useless wall won't solve anything they can build tunnels","p035","p039",2.3333,2,2,1.3333
10911,18,464,8,"Person 1","How much longer do you realistically think we will keep troops in the middle east?","p035","p039",1.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1
10912,18,464,9,"Person 2","as long as the  dollar is the reserve currency for oil which will end soon but that also means the economic collapse of this country also long overdue","p035","p039",2.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
10913,18,464,10,"Person 1","lol you don't paint a bright future.","p035","p039",2,1.6667,1.6667,1
10914,18,464,11,"Person 2","its not bright but its better to anticipate chaos then get caught with your pants down","p035","p039",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
10915,18,464,12,"Person 1","I agree with that, but it is only some much you can plan.","p035","p039",2,1,1.6667,1.6667
10916,18,464,13,"Person 2","true but I bought a farm and livestock chickens and I grew up in the ghetto with barely any trees","p035","p039",1.6667,0.6667,2,2.3333
10917,18,464,14,"Person 1","Your one of the few that have a farm and livestock 99.9 can not hunt or grow food.","p035","p039",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1
10918,18,464,15,"Person 2","I know trust me I didn't know anything about farming or hunting I just learned took me a few years but now I chop my own firewood for my wood burning stove anyone can learn anything now with the internet","p035","p039",2.6667,0.3333,1.6667,2.3333
10919,18,464,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I learned from my grandmother how to plan my own crops.","p035","p039",2,0,2,2.3333
10920,18,464,17,"Person 2","thats great the older generations really had a lot of practical knowledge and grit","p035","p039",2.3333,0,2.6667,1.3333
10921,18,464,18,"Person 1","Yeah she came from a hardworking generation","p035","p039",2.3333,0.3333,2.6667,2
10922,18,464,19,"Person 2","now the youth don't even know how to change a tire","p035","p039",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1
10923,18,464,20,"Person 1","Yeah, but car companies are making it harder to even change a head light.","p035","p039",2.3333,1.6667,2,1
10924,18,464,21,"Person 2","yea I had to youtube it when I changed mine nice chatting with you bye","p035","p039",1.6667,0,1.6667,1.6667
10925,18,464,22,"Person 1","you too bye","p035","p039",1.3333,0.3333,1.6667,1
10926,18,465,0,"Person 1","Seems like a tragic accident or misunderstanding.","p062","p064",3.3333,2,3.6667,2
10927,18,465,1,"Person 2","Yea that is what it seems like, not exactly sure how that happened but its sad that it had to escalate to that","p062","p064",3.3333,2,3.3333,2
10928,18,465,2,"Person 1","Definitely.  I can't imagine what was going through the minds of the Americans not stopping at the gate.","p062","p064",3,2,3.3333,2.3333
10929,18,465,3,"Person 2","Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \\","p062","p064",2,0,3.6667,3.3333
10931,18,465,5,"Person 2","Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train them","p062","p064",2.3333,1.3333,3,1.6667
10932,18,465,6,"Person 1","The families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training.","p062","p064",3.3333,2,4,1.6667
10933,18,465,7,"Person 2","Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prison","p062","p064",4,2,3.3333,2
10934,18,465,8,"Person 1","Wow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?","p062","p064",2.6667,0.6667,3.6667,1.6667
10935,18,465,9,"Person 2","The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselves","p062","p064",3,1.6667,3.3333,2
10936,18,465,10,"Person 1","Wow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.","p062","p064",4,2,4,3.3333
10937,18,465,11,"Person 2","Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates. I have 2 sons and would never let them join the army, so much mental illness in the military unfortunately.","p062","p064",4.3333,2,4,3.6667
10938,18,465,12,"Person 1","Yes, there's definitely a lot of that, unfortunately.  Although I've also known a lot of people who were in the military who got a ton out of it and are thankful for their time in.","p062","p064",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
10939,18,465,13,"Person 2","Really? I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the military","p062","p064",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.3333
10940,18,465,14,"Person 1","It definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army.","p062","p064",2.6667,1,2.6667,2.3333
10941,18,465,15,"Person 2","What's the difference?","p062","p064",1.6667,1,1.3333,1
10942,18,465,16,"Person 1","Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types.","p062","p064",1.6667,0.6667,3,2
10943,18,465,17,"Person 2","Oh gotcha, I've known 2 people from the air force that did well afterwards and 1 guy from the marines that had a really hard go afterwards... but def different personality types","p062","p064",2.6667,1,2,2.3333
10944,18,465,18,"Person 1","Yeah, I could certainly see that.  Air Force and Navy are sort of more \"office jobs\" and skilled professions (like mechanics).  Marines and Army are a lot more \"military military\" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately.","p062","p064",3,1.3333,3.6667,2
10945,18,465,19,"Person 2","Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to have","p062","p064",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
10946,18,465,20,"Person 1","That's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  bye","p062","p064",3.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
10947,18,465,21,"Person 2","haha bye","p062","p064",1.6667,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
10948,326,466,0,"Person 1","What did you think of the article?","p029","p039",1.6667,1,0.6667,1
10949,326,466,1,"Person 2","I thought it was funny that the Jews were upset I think they really don't care who wins the election as long as Israel gets that money","p029","p039",2.3333,0.3333,1,3
10950,326,466,2,"Person 1","Everyone loves to blame Trump for everything.  There have been hate crimes against Jews since the beginning of time.  That is nothing new.","p029","p039",3,1.3333,1,2.3333
10951,326,466,3,"Person 2","I know they secretly love Trump though they won't admit it through the media networks that they own","p029","p039",2.3333,0.3333,1,2
10952,326,466,4,"Person 1","The polls spoke for themselves.  Jewish people supported Trump more than they have other Republican candidates in the past.  Really, it's articles like this that perpetuate this whole finger pointing deal towards Trump.  It's stupid.","p029","p039",3.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333
10953,326,466,5,"Person 2","Exactly Trump has done more for Israel then any other I mean we all know America is basically run by Israel but now its so much more open with it","p029","p039",3,1,1,3
10954,326,466,6,"Person 1","Seriously, people always fail to recognize these things.  Probably because they just read CNN and disregard actual facts.  Oh well, what can you do","p029","p039",2.6667,1,1,2.6667
10955,326,466,7,"Person 2","you can only educate yourself you cant change anyones mind you can only make them think","p029","p039",2.3333,1,1,1.6667
10956,326,466,8,"Person 1","Yep, that is very very true.  Pretty much everyone I know feels the same way I do though so there's no one's mind to change","p029","p039",2.3333,1,1,2.3333
10957,326,466,9,"Person 2","yea me too I live in a rural place not the city cesspools","p029","p039",2.3333,1,1,2.6667
10958,326,466,10,"Person 1","Same here, conservative rural area.  I couldn't stand living in a big city.","p029","p039",2.6667,1,1,3.3333
10959,326,466,11,"Person 2","I grew up in the city and got the hell out first chance i got","p029","p039",2.6667,1,1,3.3333
10960,326,466,12,"Person 1","I do not blame you.  I grew up in a mid-sized city and it was bad enough, we've been so much happier since we moved out here.","p029","p039",3,1.3333,1,3.3333
10961,326,466,13,"Person 2","yep got a little fixer upper with 6 acres now I have my livestock and chickens","p029","p039",2,0.3333,1,3.3333
10962,326,466,14,"Person 1","Wow, that is great!  I would love to have livestock but that is so much work.  IA lot of our neighbors do.  I have four children and a fifth on the way so they keep me busy.  Anyway, back to the article, in general it just irritated me.","p029","p039",2.6667,0.3333,1,3.3333
10963,326,466,15,"Person 2","wow you went for the fifth! I have four my oldest just turned 6","p029","p039",3,0.6667,1,3.6667
10964,326,466,16,"Person 1","You must stay extremely busy!  :)  Yeah, my oldest is 14 and youngest is 7 months, they'll be almost exactly 1 year apart.","p029","p039",2.6667,0.3333,1,3.6667
10965,326,466,17,"Person 2","Its a mad house but i wouldn't change it for the world lol","p029","p039",2.6667,1,1,2.3333
10966,326,466,18,"Person 1","I totally hear you!!  my three youngest are under 3.  It is definitely much, much better raising them out here, I can't imagine trying to raise a family in a city around all this nonsense.  no way.","p029","p039",3.3333,1,1,3.6667
10967,326,466,19,"Person 2","Forget it my parents still live in the city and it bugs me out everytime I visit them well it was nice chatting with you bye!","p029","p039",3,0.6667,1,2.3333
10968,326,466,20,"Person 1","I bet so!!  you too, have a great day, bye!","p029","p039",2.6667,0,1,1.6667
10969,326,467,0,"Person 1","How did this article make you feel?","p062","p035",1.6667,1,2,1
10970,326,467,1,"Person 2","I was surprised because I did not know the Jewish community felt like that and you?","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
10971,326,467,2,"Person 1","Not really.  I'd be interested to know how they feel about Trump now seeing as he's been such a pro-Israel President.","p062","p035",2.3333,0.6667,2,2.3333
10972,326,467,3,"Person 2","That is a good question.","p062","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,1.6667
10973,326,467,4,"Person 1","I'm part Jewish but have never had that much connection to Jews or understanding of their feelings on their place in our society.","p062","p035",1.6667,0.3333,2.3333,3.3333
10974,326,467,5,"Person 2","why not?","p062","p035",1.3333,1,2.3333,1
10975,326,467,6,"Person 1","It's just  not a big part of my family tree.","p062","p035",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
10976,326,467,7,"Person 2","I think the holocaust put the Jewish community on edge.","p062","p035",2,1.6667,3,2
10977,326,467,8,"Person 1","Yeah, sort of like slavery for blacks. Now everything gets viewed through that prism.  Jewish history has plenty of persecution before that too.","p062","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2,2
10978,326,467,9,"Person 2","The article also said some Jewish people voted for Trump.","p062","p035",1,1,2.6667,1.3333
10979,326,467,10,"Person 1","The thing is though that I don't think Trump himself has ever done anything anti-semitic.  Certainly people who voted for him have.","p062","p035",1.6667,1.3333,2,2
10980,326,467,11,"Person 2","Trump does not really distance himself from the alt right.","p062","p035",1,0.6667,1.6667,1.6667
10981,326,467,12,"Person 1","Maybe, but I don't think his message exactly gets through when it's filtered through the media.  I thought Trump's response to Charlottesville, for example, was the correct one.  Both sides were at fault.","p062","p035",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.6667
10982,326,467,13,"Person 2","I disagree but we are all entitled to our opinions.","p062","p035",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.6667
10983,326,467,14,"Person 1","Yes, you're allowed to be wrong.","p062","p035",2.6667,1.3333,2,1.6667

10987,326,467,18,"Person 1","Yeah, it wasn't hard.  Any other thoughts on this article?  Do you think our democracy is being threatened by a Presidential election?","p062","p035",3,1,1.3333,2
10988,326,467,19,"Person 2","Yes, our Presidential election is being threaten because republicans are allowing it to be.","p062","p035",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
10989,326,467,20,"Person 1","I'm not sure what you mean.","p062","p035",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.6667
10990,326,467,21,"Person 2","The republicans are blocking bills that now allow other countries to mess with our elections which threatens our democracy.","p062","p035",2.6667,2,3,2
10991,326,467,22,"Person 1","I think you're confused about a lot of what's going on.","p062","p035",2.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667

10994,326,468,0,"Person 1","what did you think about the article?","p024","p022",1,1,1.3333,1
10995,326,468,1,"Person 2","I was able to understand the Jewish people and why they were angry. You","p024","p022",1.6667,0.6667,3.3333,2
10996,326,468,2,"Person 1","Yeah, I can definitely see why they were angry","p024","p022",2.3333,0.6667,3.6667,2.3333
10997,326,468,3,"Person 2","They're probably still thinking about what happened back the nand the history.","p024","p022",2,1,3,1.6667
10998,326,468,4,"Person 1","Yeah a lot of them survived nazi Germany and know firsthand","p024","p022",2,0.6667,3.3333,1.6667
10999,326,468,5,"Person 2","Definitely. I wonder which president Jewish people are supporting in the upcoming election","p024","p022",1.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
11000,326,468,6,"Person 1","most likely on the blue side","p024","p022",1.3333,1.3333,2,1.3333
11001,326,468,7,"Person 2","I agree. Do you know any Jewish people?","p024","p022",1,0.6667,1.6667,1.3333
11002,326,468,8,"Person 1","i know a few but not much, you?","p024","p022",1,1,1.6667,2
11003,326,468,9,"Person 2","I don't know any at all. I wish i did so i can ask them about this situation","p024","p022",2,0.6667,2.6667,2
11004,326,468,10,"Person 1","Do you support the current President?","p024","p022",1,0.6667,1.3333,1
11005,326,468,11,"Person 2","I don't. I disagree with his views and the way he is overall. You?","p024","p022",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,3
11006,326,468,12,"Person 1","same. I don't think hes even a decent president","p024","p022",3,1.6667,1.3333,3
11007,326,468,13,"Person 2","Do you have a nominee in mind for next election? I have been interested in Andrew Yang.","p024","p022",1.3333,1,1.6667,2
11008,326,468,14,"Person 1","I like Yang for his policies.","p024","p022",1.6667,0.3333,1.3333,2.3333

11010,326,468,16,"Person 1","Yeah, it starts with getting the current president impeached soon.","p024","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
11011,326,468,17,"Person 2","Let's hope it happens!","p024","p022",3.3333,0,3,1.6667

11014,326,468,20,"Person 1","bye","p024","p022",1,1,1,1
11056,326,470,0,"Person 1","What did you feel about the article?","p062","p010",1.6667,1,2.3333,1
11057,326,470,1,"Person 2","To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politics","p062","p010",2.3333,2,1.6667,3
11058,326,470,2,"Person 1","Yes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience.","p062","p010",3,2,2.3333,3
11059,326,470,3,"Person 2","It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all.","p062","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,3
11060,326,470,4,"Person 1","Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.  And it's because of how we communicate and interact with each other, not some fundamentally new divide in ideology or something.","p062","p010",2.6667,2,3,3
11061,326,470,5,"Person 2","Exactly.  I honestly wish social media was never born.","p062","p010",3,2,1.6667,2.6667
11062,326,470,6,"Person 1","Yeah, it's pretty awful.  I don't use it (although I'm so asocial in wouldn't do anything for me anyway).  But I think it's interesting because everyone seems to be coming to the same conclusion that it's bad, but they can't stop themselves from using it nonetheless.","p062","p010",2.6667,2,2.3333,3
11063,326,470,7,"Person 2","Agreed.   All these little 10 year olds committing suicide because of social media.   They shouldn't even be on social media.   It's so sad","p062","p010",4.3333,2,3,1.6667
11064,326,470,8,"Person 1","Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade.","p062","p010",3.3333,1.6667,2,2
11065,326,470,9,"Person 2","Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs.","p062","p010",3.6667,2,2.6667,2
11066,326,470,10,"Person 1","Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then.","p062","p010",3.6667,2,2.3333,2.6667
11067,326,470,11,"Person 2","Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc.","p062","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2
11068,326,470,12,"Person 1","Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care.","p062","p010",4,2,2.6667,2
11069,326,470,13,"Person 2","Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it.","p062","p010",3,1.3333,2.3333,2.6667
11070,326,470,14,"Person 1","Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems.","p062","p010",3.3333,2,2,3.3333
11071,326,470,15,"Person 2","Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities.","p062","p010",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3.6667
11072,326,470,16,"Person 1","I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now.","p062","p010",2.3333,1,1.6667,2.6667
11073,326,470,17,"Person 2","Young people live their life online - every moment documented - it portrays a life that don't live and hurts those that are absent from their postings.   It will be interesting to see it either shift away or continue its destructive path","p062","p010",3.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
11074,326,470,18,"Person 1","Yes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.  Always nice talking with reasonable, thoughtful people.  Have a great day.  bye","p062","p010",3.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
11075,326,470,19,"Person 2","It is an addiction.   Apple, Steve Jobs, would not even give his kids a phone because he knew the damage it would cause in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain as well as its addictive qualities.","p062","p010",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
11076,326,470,20,"Person 1","Yeah, that should certainly tell you something.  (Although he was willing to unleash it on the world.)  Anyway, good chatting again.  bye","p062","p010",2.3333,1,1.6667,2
11077,326,470,21,"Person 2","goodbye","p062","p010",1,1,1.6667,1
11078,297,471,0,"Person 1","what did you think about this article","p019","p022",1,1,0.6667,1
11079,297,471,1,"Person 2","I thought it was very sad what happened to the victims. You","p019","p022",2.6667,2,3.3333,2.3333
11080,297,471,2,"Person 1","Same here.... I hope they can find out what caused it","p019","p022",2,1,3,2
11081,297,471,3,"Person 2","Yeah, i ride trains all the time so this is scary","p019","p022",3,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
11082,297,471,4,"Person 1","I've actually never ridden one so I can't relate. But I'm sure it would make me more nervous if I was...","p019","p022",1.6667,2,2.6667,2.3333
11083,297,471,5,"Person 2","Wow! That's very interesting. Whats the reason for never riding on a train?","p019","p022",3,0.6667,1.3333,1.6667
11084,297,471,6,"Person 1","I just live in a small town, we can drive everywhere so we do. I dont think there even is any sort of like passenger trains, just stock ones","p019","p022",1.3333,1,1,2.6667
11085,297,471,7,"Person 2","Wow thats very cool. Have you ever flown?","p019","p022",2,0.3333,1,1.6667
11086,297,471,8,"Person 1","Yah I flew to Europe once! So do you ride trains for like commuting? Or travel?","p019","p022",1.6667,0.3333,1,3
11087,297,471,9,"Person 2","Trains are very convenient. There's almost a stop everywhere","p019","p022",1.3333,0,1,2.3333
11088,297,471,10,"Person 1","That does sound convenient. Do you drive a lot on your own then?","p019","p022",1.3333,0,1,1.6667
11089,297,471,11,"Person 2","Yes i do, i use both ways of transportation. But about the story, i feel so bad for the families of the victims","p019","p022",2,1.3333,3.6667,3
11090,297,471,12,"Person 1","Me too... That's another reason I hope they can find out the cause, is to give the families some sort of closure or reasoning. It would suck not knowing.","p019","p022",2.3333,1.3333,4,2.3333
11091,297,471,13,"Person 2","Yeah definitely. Let's hope they have a decent future moving forward","p019","p022",2,0,3.3333,2
11092,297,471,14,"Person 1","I hope so too... I also feel bad for the people that witnessed the incident. That had to have been tramautizign","p019","p022",2.3333,1.3333,4.3333,2.3333
11093,297,471,15,"Person 2","Yeah! I would have gone into depression if i saw something like that..","p019","p022",3,1.6667,4,2.6667
11094,297,471,16,"Person 1","Me too... and the people injured, that would be evne worse. Probably left thinking \"what if\"","p019","p022",2.3333,2,4.6667,2.3333
11095,297,471,17,"Person 2","I wonder what the world would be like without trains","p019","p022",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
11096,297,471,18,"Person 1","Probably a lot less developed","p019","p022",1,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
11097,297,471,19,"Person 2","I can see that. Well it was nice talking to you! bye","p019","p022",1.6667,0,1,1.6667
11098,297,471,20,"Person 1","you too! bye","p019","p022",1.6667,0,1,1.6667
11099,297,472,0,"Person 1","hey what did you think about what we read","p068","p026",2,1,0.6667,1
11100,297,472,1,"Person 2","It sounded like a bit of a scary experience for the people on the train.","p068","p026",3,1.6667,3,1.6667
11101,297,472,2,"Person 1","yeah i couldnt imagine having my train sway","p068","p026",3,1.3333,3.3333,1.6667
11102,297,472,3,"Person 2","I wish they knew what caused it. The article said it may have hit the edge of a bridge? How does that even happen?","p068","p026",3,1,2,2
11103,297,472,4,"Person 1","exactly sounds like no safety measures or inspections are done","p068","p026",2.3333,1.3333,2,1.6667
11104,297,472,5,"Person 2","It seems like there should be more procedures in place for checking transportation safety. Maybe just a safety train that runs the track once a day to check there aren't any bridges sticking out.","p068","p026",3,0.6667,2,2.6667
11105,297,472,6,"Person 1","i agree something this is the second huge crash","p068","p026",2.6667,1.3333,2.3333,1.6667
11106,297,472,7,"Person 2","It makes me a bit apprehensive about taking transit like that, and I was already a little wary of it.","p068","p026",2.6667,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
11107,297,472,8,"Person 1","same with little control of the outcome","p068","p026",2.6667,1,1.6667,2
11108,297,472,9,"Person 2","Have you ever been involved in a transportation accident like that?","p068","p026",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,1
11109,297,472,10,"Person 1","no thank god we dont really have trains around here","p068","p026",3,0,1.6667,2.6667
11110,297,472,11,"Person 2","I haven't either, though one time I was on a city bus and it took a turn too sharp and hit a light pole. It was the most boring accident ever.","p068","p026",2.6667,1.6667,1,3
11111,297,472,12,"Person 1","wow haha thats just silly i guess it was like that but way faster !","p068","p026",3.3333,1,1.6667,1.6667
11112,297,472,13,"Person 2","Another bus came and everyone just transferred over like nothing happened.","p068","p026",2.6667,1,1,2
11113,297,472,14,"Person 1","well that sounds like an easy fix lucky","p068","p026",2.6667,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
11114,297,472,15,"Person 2","Yep. Trains are weird things though, with the tracks and all. It seems like things have to be pretty exact for everything to go smoothly.","p068","p026",2.6667,1,1.3333,2.3333
11115,297,472,16,"Person 1","yeah there pretty routine i wonder if they will investigate more","p068","p026",2.6667,1,1.6667,2
11116,297,472,17,"Person 2","I'm sure they probably will. They probably need the investigation for insurance purposes.","p068","p026",2.3333,0.6667,1.3333,2.3333
11117,297,472,18,"Person 1","oh that is true need to stop the pattern of it happening","p068","p026",1.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
11118,297,472,19,"Person 2","Really, I think trains are one of the safer ways to travel. I don't know the exact statistics right now, but I think they were right after planes in safeness.","p068","p026",2,0,1.3333,1.6667
11119,297,472,20,"Person 1","i can see that maybe the technology just needs to be updated","p068","p026",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
11120,297,472,21,"Person 2","Maybe convert them all to MagLev trains. I haven't heard anything about those crashing.","p068","p026",2,0.6667,1,1.6667
11121,297,472,22,"Person 1","i have never heard of those thats interesting","p068","p026",2.3333,0.3333,1,1.3333
11122,297,472,23,"Person 2","They kind of float on magnets, so there's very little friction. I think there's a high speed MagLev train in Japan, but I could be wrong. I know it's high speed but I'm not sure of the type.","p068","p026",2.3333,0.6667,1,2
11123,297,472,24,"Person 1","that would seem scary to me high speed haha","p068","p026",3.3333,2,1.3333,2.3333
11124,297,472,25,"Person 2","Just looked it up. 375 mph.","p068","p026",2.3333,1,1,1.6667
11125,297,472,26,"Person 1","wow that is fast crazy that thats safer but i can see it","p068","p026",3.3333,0.6667,1,2
11126,297,472,27,"Person 2","The wikipedia article on Japan's high speed trains says there has never been a fatality.","p068","p026",2,0.6667,1,2.3333
11127,297,472,28,"Person 1","wow definitly need to look into switching into that technology","p068","p026",2.3333,0.3333,1.3333,1.6667
11128,297,472,29,"Person 2","It would take a large investment to switch, but I think it would be worth it.","p068","p026",2.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
11129,297,472,30,"Person 1","same here! it has been great talking to you! bye","p068","p026",2.6667,0,1.3333,1.6667

11148,297,473,17,"Person 2","Yeah but it's always possible look at what happen to area 51 all them people actually went. I wasn't excepting that but they failed lol they was like 20miles from the gate.","p024","p069",2.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333

11156,297,474,1,"Person 2","I seem to hear more stories about train crashes than I do about plane crashes. It seems strange to me.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667
11157,297,474,2,"Person 1","I wouldn't want to be in either one.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.6667,1,2
11158,297,474,3,"Person 2","No, but I think a train crash would have a higher survival rate depending on the circumstances.","p035","p030",1.6667,1.3333,1,2.3333
11159,297,474,4,"Person 1","If I had to pick one, it would definitely be the train crash.","p035","p030",2.3333,1.3333,1,2.3333

11162,297,474,7,"Person 2","I do, but it wasn't a particularly emotional article. I mean, I'm not going to lost any sleep over it or anything. Have you ever lost a loved one in an accident?","p035","p030",2,2,2,3
11163,297,474,8,"Person 1","One of my best friends died in a car accident.","p035","p030",3,2,2.6667,3

11174,297,475,1,"Person 2","Yes, it seems like it would be terrifying to be in a train derailment.","p054","p062",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
11175,297,475,2,"Person 1","Yes no doubt. And I feel terrible for the victims' families","p054","p062",3.6667,2,5,2.6667
11176,297,475,3,"Person 2","For sure.  I always think of trains as very safe modes of transportation.  It would be shocking to hear a loved one died on a train.","p054","p062",3.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
11177,297,475,4,"Person 1","I know, theyre regarded as being so safe and then somethig like the happens unexpectedly.","p054","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2
11178,297,475,5,"Person 2","I'm always puzzled about how derailments can occur.  Do the trains go too fast or are the tracks damaged or something?  I never understand it.","p054","p062",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,2.6667
11179,297,475,6,"Person 1","I would think that the tracks would be better maintained. But I guess you cant plan for every possible problem","p054","p062",2.3333,1,1.3333,2
11180,297,475,7,"Person 2","Have you ever been on a long train ride?  I've only ever been on subways and light rail.","p054","p062",1.6667,1,1,2
11181,297,475,8,"Person 1","I have not. Just subways for me. They scare me more than a train would.","p054","p062",3,1.6667,1.3333,3
11182,297,475,9,"Person 2","haha! What it is about the subway that scares you?  Being underground?","p054","p062",3,1.6667,1,1.3333
11183,297,475,10,"Person 1","Yes I think the underground aspect gives me a bit of claustrophobia. My city doesnt have subways so it isnt something Im accustomed to.","p054","p062",3,1.3333,1.6667,3
11184,297,475,11,"Person 2","Gotcha.  I can definitely see that.  They're also usually very dark and often extremely crowded.  I rode one to work for a few years.  Wasn't the best part of my day.","p054","p062",2.6667,1.3333,2,2.6667
11185,297,475,12,"Person 1","Since trains appear so safe, I would say the victims of this crash were not even expecting anything to go wrong.","p054","p062",2.3333,1.3333,3.3333,1.6667
11186,297,475,13,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm sure it was totally out of the blue.  Even though planes are safe, I think you always have in the back of your mind that at any time something could go terrible wrong in the air.  But a train?  It's gotta be unexpected.","p054","p062",2.6667,2,4,2
11187,297,475,14,"Person 1","Very much so. I hope they were able to work out whatever issues led to this crash.","p054","p062",2.3333,0.6667,2,1.6667
11188,297,475,15,"Person 2","Yeah, I'm sure they do a thorough evaluation and fix whatever was wrong.  Europe uses trains a lot more than we do, I think.  They can't afford to let things get into disrepair.","p054","p062",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
11189,297,475,16,"Person 1","It is a tragedy for sure","p054","p062",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667

11360,292,482,21,"Person 2","I feel the same, gun rights are people's rights as long as everything is legal and there is a background check and registration","p035","p031",3,1,1.3333,2

11363,292,483,0,"Person 1","Do you think people should kill themselves?","p035","p062",2,1.3333,1.3333,1
11364,292,483,1,"Person 2","I would prefer that people not feel the need to kill themselves.  That would be my hope for people.  How about you?","p035","p062",3.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2
11365,292,483,2,"Person 1","I agree, but I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body.","p035","p062",3,0.3333,2,2
11366,292,483,3,"Person 2","Do you agree with doctor-assisted suicide?  Do you think that should be legal?","p035","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.3333
11367,292,483,4,"Person 1","100 percent agree with that. I have watched many family members suffer from cancer and lupus","p035","p062",2.6667,1,2,2.3333
11368,292,483,5,"Person 2","I believe it's now legal in Canada.  Do you think there will be a push in the U.S. (I assume you're in the U.S.) to legalize it here?","p035","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1.6667
11369,292,483,6,"Person 1","Don't know, Canada is a head of the US on things like that and legal weed","p035","p062",1.3333,1,1,1.6667
11370,292,483,7,"Person 2","Yes, they're certainly more progressive.  It's just not an issue we hear much about here.  Suicide talk nowadays tends to focus on young people, which has apparently spiked.","p035","p062",1.6667,1,1.3333,2
11371,292,483,8,"Person 1","I grow up in Michigan and remember the big fuss over doctor Kevorkian","p035","p062",1.6667,1,1,3.3333
11372,292,483,9,"Person 2","Yeah, I totally forgot about him.  I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall.","p035","p062",1.6667,1,1,2
11373,292,483,10,"Person 1","He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence.","p035","p062",1,1.6667,1.3333,2
11374,292,483,11,"Person 2","I'll have to go back and read about him.  Seems strange that he thought he could get away with doing that.  But maybe I don't remember the specifics of what he did and what the laws were.","p035","p062",1.6667,1.3333,1,2
11375,292,483,12,"Person 1","He tried to push the law for something he thought was right. I don't blame him, but I do understand why it is a complex issue.","p035","p062",2,0.6667,1.6667,2.3333
11376,292,483,13,"Person 2","Yeah, it's certainly a complicated issue.  And if I were in his situation I certainly wouldn't have thought I could get away with it, even if he just felt he was enabling others to commit suicide.  But obviously he felt more passionately about it than I do.","p035","p062",2,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
11377,292,483,14,"Person 1","Have had it family members or friends that had a really prolonged illness?","p035","p062",1.3333,1,1.3333,1
11378,292,483,15,"Person 2","Umm, yes and no, I guess.  Like, I've had family members waste away in hospital beds for years.  One with Alzheimer's.  But nothing where I thought, \"Man, this person needs to be put out of their misery.\"  I've always thought life was misery.  But you stay 'til the credits.","p035","p062",3.3333,2,1.3333,3.3333
11379,292,483,16,"Person 1","I think when a person loses the joy of life and there is nothing but pain, it should be their choice.","p035","p062",2.3333,2,2.3333,2
11380,292,483,17,"Person 2","I don't look down on people who commit suicide.  I understand the desire to die.  I don't think it's \"cowardly\" or anything like that.  Is it selfish?  Sure, but so is wanting people to continue to suffer for our own sake.  But I personally don't think the state should be encouraging it in any way.","p035","p062",2.3333,0.6667,1.6667,3.3333
11381,292,483,18,"Person 1","Not encouraging it, but not making it that they have to use a gun or hang themselves","p035","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2
11382,292,483,19,"Person 2","Yeah, I understand that side of it.  Give them a place to do it \"safely\" (a bit of a misnomer, but whatever).  But I still don't agree with the tacit validation of it.  Just my opinion.","p035","p062",2.3333,1.3333,1.3333,2.6667
11383,292,483,20,"Person 1","I do not fault you for your opinion. It is great to see how other people feel about different topics.","p035","p062",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,2.6667
11384,292,483,21,"Person 2","Yeah, I always find it interesting.  I think people actually have the same values; they just weigh them differently in different situations.  What we're talking about is largely a conflict between freedom and order (maybe not the best word for it, but I'll use it anyway).  I believe in freedom of choice.  So do you and everyone.  You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values.","p035","p062",3.3333,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
11385,292,483,22,"Person 1","I can agree with that. It was very wonderful talking with you. Sorry about the typing brain farts, I have my daughter running around the room with an ear infection. bye","p035","p062",1.6667,1,1,2.3333

11391,292,484,4,"Person 1","True it is such an odd occurance","p068","p019",1.6667,1.3333,1.3333,1
11392,292,484,5,"Person 2","Yah... I'm honestly kind of glad he killed himself","p068","p019",2.3333,1.3333,2,2
11393,292,484,6,"Person 1","Yeah we don't need that kind of person running around society","p068","p019",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333
11394,292,484,7,"Person 2","agreed... and that way money/time isn't wasted on him","p068","p019",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,1.3333

11407,292,485,0,"Person 1","Well, this article was a little vague and confusing.","p030","p022",2,1.6667,1,1.6667
11408,292,485,1,"Person 2","I thought that it was very vague. It doesn't even give a back story but i feel bad for hte police","p030","p022",2.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
11409,292,485,2,"Person 1","Why do you feel bad for the police?","p030","p022",1.6667,1,1,1
11410,292,485,3,"Person 2","I read the article a while ago, but didnt it mention a police getting killed?","p030","p022",1.6667,1,1.6667,1.3333
11411,292,485,4,"Person 1","No, the article I read only mentioned one 70 year old man and the shooter being dead. Then, it looped back around and said the shooter was still barricaded in his house at the end.","p030","p022",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1.6667
11412,292,485,5,"Person 2","That's weird. Although mine did mention the shooter barricaded in the house. It was a weirdly worded article overall. Do you think the police are too aggressive?","p030","p022",2.3333,1,1,1.6667
11413,292,485,6,"Person 1","I think that police are trained to be aggressive in both speech and action, but only listening/watching media outlets will give you a very biased view of the situation. You?","p030","p022",2.6667,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
11414,292,485,7,"Person 2","I agree. There's definitely bad police out there but only the bad ones are shown on media outlets like you said. The other 80% don't get credit","p030","p022",3,2,1.6667,2
11415,292,485,8,"Person 1","I mean, I think there's something to be said for the so called \"good cops\" who are passively complicit in all the unethical shenanigans and miscarriages of justice that the others get into, but I don't think that turning the fantasy of us against them into a reality will pan out for either side.","p030","p022",3,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
11416,292,485,9,"Person 2","Yeah, i've never had any bad experiences with police but then again, i never retaliate. Have you ever run into bad police?","p030","p022",2,0.6667,1,2.3333
11417,292,485,10,"Person 1","On several occasions, but that hasn't negatively colored my perception of a group of people who, by and large, are just trying to do their job in a negative light. Of course, I have the privilege of being white.","p030","p022",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,3
11418,292,485,11,"Person 2","That's good. You should like you have your head on straight and not influenced by others much","p030","p022",1.6667,0.6667,1,1.6667
11419,292,485,12,"Person 1","Being open to diverse viewpoints is critically important, but blindly swallowing and regurgitating the opinions of the group is dangerous. Do you have any feelings on the availability of semi-automatic rifles?","p030","p022",3,1,1,1.6667
11420,292,485,13,"Person 2","Hm i think that they should be harder to get ahold of. People thinking that taking away semi-auto rifles will automatically stop mass killings are dead wrong. People will always find other ways","p030","p022",3,1.3333,1.3333,2.3333
11421,292,485,14,"Person 1","I agree. I think that people are very quick to assign blame and knee jerk into a quick fix, but slow to address the roots of social problems that are driving the shooters to behave in such a violent manner.","p030","p022",3,1.6667,1.3333,2.3333
11422,292,485,15,"Person 2","Yeah i suffer depression and anxiety myself and sometimes i feel like these people just need someone to talk to because they feel alone in the world. There was a recent video where a teacher stopped a shooter and began hugging him and the shooter started tearing up i believe. It was very sad.","p030","p022",3.6667,2,3,3.3333
11423,292,485,16,"Person 1","Yeah, I actually saw that headline. The stark reality is that even though we are now all superficially tethered together by the world wide web, the world is more alienating and lonesome than ever before. This is done with purpose, because those feelings drive humans to consume in order to fill that void.","p030","p022",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
11424,292,485,17,"Person 2","Would you wish for a world that doesn't have social media at all? Or back to the old days with only instant messaging and texting.","p030","p022",2,1,1,1.6667
11425,292,485,18,"Person 1","I don't participate in social media. When I was a kid I had a Myspace, but my involvement ended after that. Thus far I think that it has been a net negative for our society and I'm glad to have come up before it was so ubiquitous. How about you?","p030","p022",2.3333,1.6667,1.3333,2.6667
11426,292,485,19,"Person 2","I use it and seeing all these people flaunt their wealth does get to me. It makes you feel small . I believe this is the 10th turn. It was nice talking to you! Finally someone that answers and doesn't just type random things. Bye!","p030","p022",3,1,1,2.3333
11427,292,485,20,"Person 1","Nice talking to you also! bye","p030","p022",2.3333,1,1,1.6667

11434,395,486,5,"Person 2","that plus the kids health issue just probably didnt take time to decompress","p000","p068",3,1,3,2
11435,395,486,6,"Person 1","Its really hard when you have to be the rock and hold it together for everyone else but never ae allowed the chance to break down or have a repreieve","p000","p068",2.6667,2,3.3333,2
11436,395,486,7,"Person 2","I agree and she was so young when they married i think it was probable theyd grow apart","p000","p068",2.6667,1.6667,2.6667,3
11437,395,486,8,"Person 1","I agree, as I am a result of a young marriage due to pregnancy that resulted in divorce, she was not allowed to live before having to grow up and being responsible for another person","p000","p068",3,2,2.3333,3
11438,395,486,9,"Person 2","yes agreed it seems so much and then he was probably insecure and controlling as she was pretty and young they were not happy, cant believe it end in killing tho","p000","p068",2.3333,2,3,2.6667
11439,395,486,10,"Person 1","I tell my husband, if you are unhappy, walk away. If I am no longer making you happy I wont stop you . I couldnt imagine him or I attacking each other and ending in murder/suicide.","p000","p068",2.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3.3333
11440,395,486,11,"Person 2","Agreed, they should have had better communication and resolved things civilly if only she could have had resources to help her get away she probably felt trapped","p000","p068",2.3333,1.6667,3.6667,2.3333
11441,395,486,12,"Person 1","But I still do not understand the killing of the children. It makes no sense. They did nothing wrong","p000","p068",3.6667,1.6667,3,1.6667
11442,395,486,13,"Person 2","maybe he wanted them all to be together forever ind of thinking","p000","p068",3,0.6667,2.3333,1.6667

11444,395,486,15,"Person 2","oh true ive seen other stories with that mindset","p000","p068",2,1,2,1.6667
11445,395,486,16,"Person 1","It reminds me of the recent killings where he killed his wife who was pregnant and 2 children but he claimed they went missing. while it wasnt a murder suicide, its the same mind set","p000","p068",2.3333,1.3333,2,2

11453,395,486,24,"Person 1","I have gotten to know him pretty well but  you never really know someone. Look at all the news with teachers having relations with students, ect. The person you think you know is just the person they want you to see.","p000","p068",2.6667,1.6667,1.3333,3.3333

11461,395,487,0,"Person 1","What a sad, sad story (:","p010","p035",4,2,3.6667,1.6667
11462,395,487,1,"Person 2","I agree. I still think the dad was wrong.","p010","p035",3,2,3,1.6667
11463,395,487,2,"Person 1","By the article, there was a great deal going on their lives, regardless of the Mom's PTSD with the little girl.   The entire household would be affected.   I just do not understand how things get so dark you would someone especially your family.","p010","p035",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
11464,395,487,3,"Person 2","I feel that it is a dad's job to protect his children and never to harm them. I feel sorry for all the things going on in their house, but that is no excuse for what he did.","p010","p035",3.3333,2,3.3333,2.3333
11465,395,487,4,"Person 1","I totally agree.   If one of them had mental illness, the other should have insisted they get help or have them committed.","p010","p035",3,1.6667,2.6667,2.3333
11466,395,487,5,"Person 2","It has to be hard on the both families what happened.","p010","p035",2.6667,1.6667,3.6667,1.6667
11467,395,487,6,"Person 1","All the parents, grandparents, friends, etc.   I cannot imagine what they all feel.","p010","p035",4,2,4.3333,1.6667
11468,395,487,7,"Person 2","Mark's family seemed really supportive.","p010","p035",2.3333,0.6667,2.6667,1.3333
11469,395,487,8,"Person 1","They did.   My daughter has a lifelong friend whose husband is very mentally ill.   Her lifelong friend will not do what is the best for him.   My daughter is a psyc major.   Her fear is he will kill of them.   They have three little boys.  It just seems like everybody has their head in the sand.   Just like this story.","p010","p035",3.6667,1.6667,3.3333,3.6667
11470,395,487,9,"Person 2","Sorry to hear that.","p010","p035",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
11471,395,487,10,"Person 1","The interesting thing about this article is Facebook told a different story.  I feel like most of Facebook just wants to project look at me, look at me.","p010","p035",2.6667,2,2.3333,2.3333
11472,395,487,11,"Person 2","I agree, I do not post good or bad things to social media. I like my life to be my life.","p010","p035",1.3333,1.3333,1.6667,2.3333
11473,395,487,12,"Person 1","Agreed.   I worry about the first generation of our kids children.   Everything is on social media.   Worst thing that we have ever technologically done.","p010","p035",3,1.6667,2,1.6667
11474,395,487,13,"Person 2","Now people kill themselves over what strangers say in the comments.","p010","p035",2.6667,2,2,1.6667
11475,395,487,14,"Person 1","Yes they do.  We had a freshman in high school jump off a bridge because of horrendous bullying.   However, I feel like parents have a huge responsibility of monitoring all social media AND no child should have those accounts until high school","p010","p035",4,2,2.3333,3
11476,395,487,15,"Person 2","I would agree with that. I think children are exposed to a lot of concepts that at that age I had no clue about and was happy not having a clue about.","p010","p035",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2.6667
11477,395,487,16,"Person 1","All kinds of studies indicate that their brains cannot process what is going on because their frontal cortex is not developed.   You can't unsee what you saw.","p010","p035",2.3333,2,2,1.6667
11478,395,487,17,"Person 2","I agree. I found it heart breaking that the child got a heart transport and had to die by a gunshot.","p010","p035",4,2,3.6667,2
11479,395,487,18,"Person 1","I cannot think about that much.   It's very disturbing.  What were they thinking as they were being shot (:","p010","p035",4.3333,2,3.6667,2.3333
11480,395,487,19,"Person 2","I know this conversation is about empathy, I just can not put myself in the shoes of killing my family.","p010","p035",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,2.3333
11481,395,487,20,"Person 1","Nor can I.   It has been great chatting with you today.   I hope your day is filled with joy.    goodbye","p010","p035",2.6667,1,1.3333,1.6667
11482,395,487,21,"Person 2","You too! bye","p010","p035",2,0.6667,1,1.3333
11483,395,488,0,"Person 1","what a tragic story","p031","p030",4,2,4,1.6667
11484,395,488,1,"Person 2","yeah, it just goes to show that you can never really know what people are going through behind the scenes.","p031","p030",2,1.6667,4,1.6667
11485,395,488,2,"Person 1","I feel extreme pity for the kids and wife but nothing but anger for the husband-he is a coward for taking his young kids' lives!","p031","p030",4.6667,2,4.3333,2.6667
11486,395,488,3,"Person 2","the dog too!","p031","p030",3.6667,1.6667,4,1.6667
11487,395,488,4,"Person 1","yes! He could have worked things out with some counseling. If his wife did not want to be with him he did not have to kill everybody!","p031","p030",4,2,3.6667,2
11488,395,488,5,"Person 2","True, thinking of all the wasted potential is truly depressing. They didn't really go into detail about the domestic abuse, but someone doesn't just turn into a murderer over night.","p031","p030",3,1.6667,3.3333,2
11489,395,488,6,"Person 1","I think the wife should have left him sooner, maybe the kids would still be alive today. When someone is abusive you just pack up and leave without even have them suspect anything-things can turn pretty ugly with abusive and mental people and there is no telling what they can do!","p031","p030",3,2,3,2.3333
11490,395,488,7,"Person 2","Exactly, the fact he thought a trip to Disneyland was going to fix deeply rooted problems in his marriage was pretty pathetic.","p031","p030",2.3333,2,2,1.6667
11491,395,488,8,"Person 1","yes, the wife should have seen this as a red flag but I guess everybody thinks that their husband, no matter how abusive will kill them and their children","p031","p030",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
11492,395,488,9,"Person 2","Have you ever been in an abusive relationship?","p031","p030",1.3333,1.3333,1.3333,1
11493,395,488,10,"Person 1","I came across people like that in relationships and cut it off right away, luckily, have you?","p031","p030",2,1,1.6667,2.6667
11494,395,488,11,"Person 2","yes, actually. I went through a long period of rationalizing their behavior before I cut it off though.","p031","p030",2.6667,2,2,3.3333
11495,395,488,12,"Person 1","it's understandable-that's what abusers do, some of them are very charismatic and make us believe that they are angles and your're the problem","p031","p030",2,2,2.3333,1.6667
11496,395,488,13,"Person 2","yep, plus lots of gas lighting. So, do you think the husband would have reacted differently if his wife had just stolen away with the kids?","p031","p030",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
11497,395,488,14,"Person 1","maybe if she went to stay with a family and went away to a disclosed location, it would stop him from killing everyone-if he just wanted to take his life, fine, go ahead!","p031","p030",3.3333,2,2.3333,1.6667
11498,395,488,15,"Person 2","Do you think he was aware of her facebook posts?","p031","p030",1.3333,1,2,1
11499,395,488,16,"Person 1","of course, it's all public, that probably ignited the fire even more, she should not have done it","p031","p030",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
11500,395,488,17,"Person 2","yeah, I thought that was a mistake on her part. I can understand how trapped she must have felt though and needed to have her feelings validated.","p031","p030",1.6667,1.6667,3,2
11501,395,488,18,"Person 1","she should have done it privately. however, damage is done and he stole his kids lives, tragic and pathetic","p031","p030",2.6667,2,2.6667,2
11502,395,488,19,"Person 2","definitely, well thanks for chatting! bye","p031","p030",1.6667,0.6667,1.3333,1.3333

11514,395,489,10,"Person 1","yes it is very scary especially since these abusers are narcassists and know how to manipulate","p020","p068",4,2,3,2
11515,395,489,11,"Person 2","Those are the scariest kind of people","p020","p068",3.6667,2,3,1.6667
11516,395,489,12,"Person 1","i agree","p020","p068",2,0.6667,2,1.6667

11525,395,490,0,"Person 1","Those poor children and that poor dog.","p030","p022",3.3333,2,4.3333,2.6667
11526,395,490,1,"Person 2","That was so disturbing to read. I agree, i can't believe someone can not only kill the children but also the dog?","p030","p022",3.3333,2,3.6667,2.6667
11527,395,490,2,"Person 1","Yeah, poor pup didn't do anything wrong. Also, who decides that a trip to Disney World is going to resolve deeply rooted marital issues?","p030","p022",3.6667,2,3.6667,2.6667
11528,395,490,3,"Person 2","Interesting people. I suffer from depression as well but i don't think i would ever do something that extreme.","p030","p022",3.6667,1.3333,2.3333,3.3333
11529,395,490,4,"Person 1","The vast majority of people who suffer from mental illnesses, myself included, are not violent in any way. It's the exceptional outliers that get all the attention.","p030","p022",2,1,2,3
11530,395,490,5,"Person 2","Yes! Which is why everyone thinks people with depression are \"dangerous\" or people just want to stay away form them.","p030","p022",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.3333
11531,395,490,6,"Person 1","The stigma surrounding mental illness is inexcusable and unfounded, but bolstered by books, movies and television. So, the average person has no idea how warped their perception really is.","p030","p022",2.3333,2,2.3333,2.6667
11532,395,490,7,"Person 2","These people need more help instead of people hating them you are right","p030","p022",2.3333,1,4,2.3333
11533,395,490,8,"Person 1","And more social integration. Anyway, do you think the husband knew that his wife was broadcasting her intentions on Facebook?","p030","p022",1.6667,1,2.3333,2.3333
11534,395,490,9,"Person 2","probably not, it was just a very messed up situatino. I still can't believe she couldn't even let the dog go.","p030","p022",2.3333,1.6667,3,2.3333
11535,395,490,10,"Person 1","You have to be an exceptional kind of depraved to murder your own children in cold blood, but yeah, I keep coming back to the dog.","p030","p022",4,1.6667,3.6667,2.6667
11536,395,490,11,"Person 2","I don't even know the logic. I'm trying to see it from her side and maybe she did it so the children don't grow up traumatized or whatever, but the  dog?? Why?!","p030","p022",4.3333,2,3.3333,2.6667
11537,395,490,12,"Person 1","Maybe the dog tried to intervene as she was murdering the only family the dog had.","p030","p022",2.3333,1.3333,2.6667,2.3333
11538,395,490,13,"Person 2","That's true, i was thinking more of the dog was outdoors and after she killed her family, she went out and shot the dog before shooting herself","p030","p022",2.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2.6667
11539,395,490,14,"Person 1","Or, perhaps she never liked the dog and had a grudge against it for one reason or another. Did the article mention if the woman worked?","p030","p022",1.6667,1.3333,2.3333,2.3333
11540,395,490,15,"Person 2","I don't believe i read anything about her. I jsut remember the husband's family saying HE was a working man. This is some Amityville Horror type stuff","p030","p022",3,1.6667,2.3333,2.3333
11541,395,490,16,"Person 1","No kidding. I wonder if their home was sold or destroyed.","p030","p022",2.3333,1,2,2.3333

11547,218,491,3,"Person 2","unfortunately, the government regularly fails in its intended duties. It's crazy to me that people in Flint are still having to use bottled water for everything.","p068","p030",3.6667,1.6667,3.6667,2
11548,218,491,4,"Person 1","yeah i thought that was fixed when the media coverage went away i guess not","p068","p030",2.6667,1.3333,1.6667,1.6667
11549,218,491,5,"Person 2","it's been years now and those in power are still failing to act. You'd think there'd be some actor willing to take up the cause to get the problem fixed, but I think the problem stems from corporate interest.","p068","p030",3,2,2,2.3333
11550,218,491,6,"Person 1","yeah i agree i thought some celebrities were doing alot in the beggining its crazy","p068","p030",2.6667,1.6667,1.6667,1.6667

11557,218,491,13,"Person 2","yeah, it's purified water that you can get delivered or just buy from the supermarket. Water from the tap is safe to bathe in but imbibing it can make you sick.","p068","p030",1,1,1.6667,2.3333
11558,218,491,14,"Person 1","oh that seems super helpful but i cant imagine not having the convenience of drinking from the tap","p068","p030",2,1,3,2.3333
11559,218,491,15,"Person 2","right? It's definitely a luxury that we take for granted.","p068","p030",2,0.6667,3,1.6667

11567,218,492,2,"Person 1","Why do all the work to see if drinking water is safe, and then assess no fines or penalties?","p010","p025",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,1.3333
11568,218,492,3,"Person 2","Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. It is crazy that only 3% faced any sort of repercussions.","p010","p025",3.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
11569,218,492,4,"Person 1","I know!   So we are wasting millions in analyzing and then do nothing.   The entire article I was thinking we need more Erin Brockovich's in the world to hold all accountable.","p010","p025",4,1.3333,3,2
11570,218,492,5,"Person 2","So true. I was thinking that the government needs to set up some sort of national task force or something similar.","p010","p025",3,0.6667,2.6667,1.6667
11571,218,492,6,"Person 1","I feel nothing is being done due to all the kickbacks and buyoffs that has to be going on.","p010","p025",3.3333,2,2.6667,1.6667
11572,218,492,7,"Person 2","Yeah and all of the de-regulation. Not to mention that the head of the EPA is a stooge.","p010","p025",3.6667,2,1.6667,1.6667
11573,218,492,8,"Person 1","Yes he is.   I think in another 20 years, clean water will be almost unattainable","p010","p025",3.3333,2,2,1.3333
11574,218,492,9,"Person 2","I think that will surely be true in a lot of places. However certain states have their own rules when it comes to water and they are better than others. As a whole the situation is going to get a lot worse unless something is done.","p010","p025",3.3333,1.6667,2.3333,2
11575,218,492,10,"Person 1","I know.  There are several counties in Eastern KY and of course Michigan than have not had clean water for years.  Those counties in Eastern Kentucky were on TV.   They are poor and do not have the extra cash to buy water all the time.   There was a huge fundraiser that was done.  They raised enough for 2 years of water for them.   Residents were showing what their water was.   It was black sludge.   The county knew it and did nothing.   He was videoed and ran from the cameras.   Makes me very angry.","p010","p025",4.6667,2,4,2.3333
11576,218,492,11,"Person 2","It is unacceptable. Unfortunately I don't see anything changing unless there is a new President who supports the EPA in 2020.","p010","p025",3.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
11577,218,492,12,"Person 1","Obama didn't do anything for them either.   It should be at the top of every sitting President's list but it gets shoeved","p010","p025",3.6667,2,2.6667,1.6667
11578,218,492,13,"Person 2","It is true that those things happened while Obama was in office. I just don't see how anything can be done when Andrew Wheeler is the man in charge of the EPA.","p010","p025",3.3333,2,2,1.6667
11579,218,492,14,"Person 1","I so agree.   EPA is run horribly.  My main concern other than the penalties/fines, etc. is what it is doing to our children.   I am extremely concerned.","p010","p025",3.6667,2,3.6667,2
11580,218,492,15,"Person 2","I am as well. This article did not even mention PFAS. Have you heard of it?","p010","p025",2.3333,1.6667,2.3333,1.3333

11583,218,492,18,"Person 1","Ooh.   None of this is good.   I think the whole process of getting anything done anymore is there are too many levels changes go through to get anything substantial done.","p010","p025",3.6667,2,2.3333,1.6667
11584,218,492,19,"Person 2","Yeah that and lobbyists. I hate that lobbyists are allowed to operate how they do.","p010","p025",3,1.6667,2,1.6667

11588,218,492,23,"Person 2","I honestly never really paid attention to politics until 2016. It is very hard to know what is true and what is not true when it is not illegal to lie to the American people.(as long as you are not under oath.)","p010","p025",2.3333,1.6667,2,2
11589,218,492,24,"Person 1","Every President from the beginning of time lies, lies, lies.  The only one I feel was truthful was Abraham Lincoln.   Sad to type it.","p010","p025",4.3333,2,2,2

11638,218,495,1,"Person 2","I think this issue is going to be a major problem for older cities, what do you think?","p010","p035",2,1.6667,2,2
11639,218,495,2,"Person 1","Absolutely.  And not even older cities anymore.  Most states have areas where they have not had clean water for up to 5 years.   Small towns in Eastern Kentucky is an example","p010","p035",2,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
11640,218,495,3,"Person 2","Yeah, I do not see a simple answer for this one.","p010","p035",2,1.3333,1.6667,2
11641,218,495,4,"Person 1","Me either.   EPA hands out violations but doesn't follow up or assign huge monetary fines is ridiculous.  Why do the work if there is no follow up to see if company fixed their issues","p010","p035",3,1.6667,1.6667,2
11642,218,495,5,"Person 2","Not companies but local and state governments. I think what they did to Flint should be a crime.","p010","p035",3.3333,1.6667,2.6667,2
11643,218,495,6,"Person 1","It was.    The county government in Eastern Kentucky just kept tons of money (I don't know the details - just saw it on the News) and nothing was fixed.   They have no drinking water, cooking water, or water to bathe or for toilets.  It just makes me mad.","p010","p035",4.6667,1.6667,3.3333,2

11647,218,495,10,"Person 1","It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average.","p010","p035",3,2,3,2
11648,218,495,11,"Person 2","That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country.","p010","p035",3.3333,2,4.3333,1.6667
11649,218,495,12,"Person 1","We are the United States of America on the decline.  Pollution, drinking water, education, housing costs, 1 out of 5 people are hungry - we need to oust everyone every year in the government so it doesn't become about them personally.","p010","p035",4,1.6667,3,2
11650,218,495,13,"Person 2","I can agree with that, outside money should have never have been allowed in government.","p010","p035",2.6667,1.6667,2,2
11651,218,495,14,"Person 1","Agreed.   Did you see the documentary on Flint on all the neglect, corruptness, etc.?   They needed an Erin Brockavich. (Spelling)","p010","p035",3,1.6667,2.3333,1.6667
11652,218,495,15,"Person 2","No, I have not seen it. I know they switch water supplies to save money.","p010","p035",2,1.3333,2,1.6667
11653,218,495,16,"Person 1","It's even worse that I had imagined.  I worry about all those folks","p010","p035",3.3333,2,4.3333,1.6667

11668,103,496,11,"Person 2","I totally agree it makes you feel so grateful knowing that is not how our country runs. It is little scary knowing it did happen in the usa and america did not take criminal action.","p031","p020",2.3333,1,2,2.3333

11722,103,498,11,"Person 2","Maybe pressure from the government?","p035","p054",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.3333
11723,103,498,12,"Person 1","That is more than likely true.","p035","p054",1.3333,1.6667,2,1.6667
