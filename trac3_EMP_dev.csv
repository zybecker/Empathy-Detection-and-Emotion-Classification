That's just my assumption though based on the article stating that data from the past 30 years has shown that ice starts melting faster in the Spring in polar regions and it takes longer to freeze again in the Fall.",3,1.5
62,175,18,108,"Wow did you hear about that shooting? It's crazy isn't it? I can't believe what a common occurance this is.Every day there seems to be some horrible news story revolving around someone shooting someone. Well, I mean I suppose things were happening at about this rate when we were younger but there wasn't that constant barrage of media we get all the time now. Either way, tragic and I am so sick of gun crime.",3.3333333333333335,6.75
63,179,18,65,"I suppose this explosion was caused by illegal fuel. If the fuel was being transported legally this event could have been avoided and many lives saved. use of illegal fuel is a serious issue that requires action from governments, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to address. This may involve strengthening regulations and enforcement mechanisms, as well as promoting the use of clean and sustainable energy sources.",5.666666666666667,5.25
64,183,19,49,"This article is a bit silly. I still don't really understand why the wolf needed to die? What is for fun? What someone in danger? The article isn't very informative, it just wants to paint the person who killed the wolf as a bad person. But until we have more details it's just emotional garbage and not worth reading.",1.8333333333333333,1.375
65,184,19,145,"I just read a story about a person who was brought to our country when he was 3, over 30 years ago. He was adopted into an abusive family, then fostered by another which was equally abusive. He has had a troubled life, and spent time in jail, but has married and seemingly turned his life around over the last few years. He recently applied for a green card, and of course his background check showed all his troubles. That makes him eligible for deportation, and that is what will happen, if it hasn't already. He will leave his wife and family and his home for a country that will be alien to him, and where he will be a total stanger.
It seems to me that we have chosen to do things, not because it is right, but because we are afraid of what we can't control, and so control those we can.",5.5,5.75
66,190,19,130,"I just read about what is going on in Syria in Aleppo and it's horrible. I would hate to live in a place that is an active warzone -- too many people are suffering and dying over there right now and I just wish I could so something about it, but I know I can't. It makes me feel powerless knowing how much people are suffering and all I can do is sit back and watch. Hopefully the US or the UN will step in and help with this horrible situation. Nobody should have to starve to death or be killed in a pointless war like this.",7,7
